Artificial intelligence-aided protein engineering: from topological data   analysis to deep protein language models,"Yuchi Qiu, Guo-Wei Wei","Protein engineering is an emerging field in biotechnology that has the potential to revolutionize various areas, such as antibody design, drug discovery, food security, ecology, and more. However, the mutational space involved is too vast to be handled through experimental means alone. Leveraging accumulative protein databases, machine learning (ML) models, particularly those based on natural language processing (NLP), have considerably expedited protein engineering. Moreover, advances in topological data analysis (TDA) and artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2, have made more powerful structure-based ML-assisted protein engineering strategies possible. This review aims to offer a comprehensive, systematic, and indispensable set of methodological components, including TDA and NLP, for protein engineering and to facilitate their future development.",2023-07-27T02:14:09Z,2023-07-27T02:14:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14587v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14587v1,q-bio.BM
Validation of an LLM-based Multi-Agent Framework for Protein Engineering   in Dry Lab and Wet Lab,"Zan Chen, Yungeng Liu, Yu Guang Wang, Yiqing Shen","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced efficiency across various domains, including protein engineering, where they offer promising opportunities for dry lab and wet lab experiment workflow automation. Previous work, namely TourSynbio-Agent, integrates a protein-specialized multimodal LLM (i.e. TourSynbio-7B) with domain-specific deep learning (DL) models to streamline both computational and experimental protein engineering tasks. While initial validation demonstrated TourSynbio-7B's fundamental protein property understanding, the practical effectiveness of the complete TourSynbio-Agent framework in real-world applications remained unexplored. This study presents a comprehensive validation of TourSynbio-Agent through five diverse case studies spanning both computational (dry lab) and experimental (wet lab) protein engineering. In three computational case studies, we evaluate the TourSynbio-Agent's capabilities in mutation prediction, protein folding, and protein design. Additionally, two wet-lab validations demonstrate TourSynbio-Agent's practical utility: engineering P450 proteins with up to 70% improved selectivity for steroid 19-hydroxylation, and developing reductases with 3.7x enhanced catalytic efficiency for alcohol conversion. Our findings from the five case studies establish that TourSynbio-Agent can effectively automate complex protein engineering workflows through an intuitive conversational interface, potentially accelerating scientific discovery in protein engineering.",2024-11-09T01:14:41Z,2024-11-09T01:14:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06029v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06029v1,q-bio.QM
Remaining Useful Life Prediction for Aircraft Engines using LSTM,"Anees Peringal, Mohammed Basheer Mohiuddin, Ahmed Hassan","This study uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of jet engines from time-series data, crucial for aircraft maintenance and safety. The LSTM model's performance is compared with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) on the C-MAPSS dataset from NASA, which contains jet engine run-to-failure events. The LSTM learns from temporal sequences of sensor data, while the MLP learns from static data snapshots. The LSTM model consistently outperforms the MLP in prediction accuracy, demonstrating its superior ability to capture temporal dependencies in jet engine degradation patterns. The software for this project is in https://github.com/AneesPeringal/rul-prediction.git.",2024-01-15T10:54:08Z,2024-01-15T10:54:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07590v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07590v1,eess.SP
The spatial dynamics of ecosystem engineers,"Caroline Franco, José F. Fontanari","The changes on abiotic features of ecosystems have rarely been taken into account by population dynamics models, which typically focus on trophic and competitive interactions between species. However, understanding the population dynamics of organisms that must modify their habitats in order to survive, the so-called ecosystem engineers, requires the explicit incorporation of abiotic interactions in the models. Here we study a model of ecosystem engineers that is discrete both in space and time, and where the engineers and their habitats are arranged in patches fixed to the sites of regular lattices. The growth of the engineer population is modeled by Ricker equation with a density-dependent carrying capacity that is given by the number of modified habitats. A diffusive dispersal stage ensures that a fraction of the engineers move from their birth patches to neighboring patches. We find that dispersal influences the metapopulation dynamics only in the case that the local or single-patch dynamics exhibits chaotic behavior. In that case, it can suppress the chaotic behavior and avoid extinctions in the regime of large intrinsic growth rate of the population.",2016-11-28T18:52:36Z,2017-08-10T23:58:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09283v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09283v3,q-bio.PE
AutoProteinEngine: A Large Language Model Driven Agent Framework for   Multimodal AutoML in Protein Engineering,"Yungeng Liu, Zan Chen, Yu Guang Wang, Yiqing Shen","Protein engineering is important for biomedical applications, but conventional approaches are often inefficient and resource-intensive. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise, their training or implementation into protein engineering remains challenging for biologists without specialized computational expertise. To address this gap, we propose AutoProteinEngine (AutoPE), an agent framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for multimodal automated machine learning (AutoML) for protein engineering. AutoPE innovatively allows biologists without DL backgrounds to interact with DL models using natural language, lowering the entry barrier for protein engineering tasks. Our AutoPE uniquely integrates LLMs with AutoML to handle model selection for both protein sequence and graph modalities, automatic hyperparameter optimization, and automated data retrieval from protein databases. We evaluated AutoPE through two real-world protein engineering tasks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements compared to traditional zero-shot and manual fine-tuning approaches. By bridging the gap between DL and biologists' domain expertise, AutoPE empowers researchers to leverage DL without extensive programming knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/tsynbio/AutoPE.",2024-11-07T05:23:31Z,2024-11-07T05:23:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04440v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04440v1,q-bio.QM
Organizing genome engineering for the gigabase scale,"Bryan A. Bartley, Jacob Beal, Jonathan R. Karr, Elizabeth A. Strychalski","Engineering the entire genome of an organism enables large-scale changes in organization, function, and external interactions, with significant implications for industry, medicine, and the environment. Improvements to DNA synthesis and organism engineering are already enabling substantial changes to organisms with megabase genomes, such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Simultaneously, recent advances in genome-scale modeling are increasingly informing the design of metabolic networks. However, major challenges remain for integrating these and other relevant technologies into workflows that can scale to the engineering of gigabase genomes.   In particular, we find that a major under-recognized challenge is coordinating the flow of models, designs, constructs, and measurements across the large teams and complex technological systems that will likely be required for gigabase genome engineering. We recommend that the community address these challenges by 1) adopting and extending existing standards and technologies for representing and exchanging information at the gigabase genomic scale, 2) developing new technologies to address major open questions around data curation and quality control, 3) conducting fundamental research on the integration of modeling and design at the genomic scale, and 4) developing new legal and contractual infrastructure to better enable collaboration across multiple institutions.",2019-09-03T22:04:34Z,2019-09-03T22:04:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01468v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01468v1,q-bio.GN
Correctness of Backtest Engines,"Robert Löw, Stanislaus Maier-Paape, Andreas Platen","In recent years several trading platforms appeared which provide a backtest engine to calculate historic performance of self designed trading strategies on underlying candle data. The construction of a correct working backtest engine is, however, a subtle task as shown by Maier-Paape and Platen (cf. arXiv:1412.5558 [q-fin.TR]). Several platforms are struggling on the correctness.   In this work, we discuss the problem how the correctness of backtest engines can be verified. We provide models for candles and for intra-period prices which will be applied to conduct a proof of correctness for a given backtest engine if the here provided tests on specific model candles are successful. Furthermore, we hint to algorithmic considerations in order to allow for a fast implementation of these tests necessary for the proof of correctness.",2015-09-28T09:30:12Z,2015-09-28T09:30:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08248v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08248v1,"q-fin.TR, q-fin.CP"
New Security Challenges on Machine Learning Inference Engine: Chip   Cloning and Model Reverse Engineering,"Shanshi Huang, Xiaochen Peng, Hongwu Jiang, Yandong Luo, Shimeng Yu","Machine learning inference engine is of great interest to smart edge computing. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture has shown significant improvements in throughput and energy efficiency for hardware acceleration. Emerging non-volatile memory technologies offer great potential for instant on and off by dynamic power gating. Inference engine is typically pre-trained by the cloud and then being deployed to the filed. There are new attack models on chip cloning and neural network model reverse engineering. In this paper, we propose countermeasures to the weight cloning and input-output pair attacks. The first strategy is the weight fine-tune to compensate the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) offset for a specific chip instance while inducing significant accuracy drop for cloned chip instances. The second strategy is the weight shuffle and fake rows insertion to allow accurate propagation of the activations of the neural network only with a key.",2020-03-21T19:58:14Z,2020-03-21T19:58:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09739v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09739v1,eess.SP
Microfluidic cell engineering on high-density microelectrode arrays for   assessing structure-function relationships in living neuronal networks,"Yuya Sato, Hideaki Yamamoto, Hideyuki Kato, Takashi Tanii, Shigeo Sato, Ayumi Hirano-Iwata","Neuronal networks in dissociated culture combined with cell engineering technology offer a pivotal platform to constructively explore the relationship between structure and function in living neuronal networks. Here, we fabricated defined neuronal networks possessing a modular architecture on high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs), a state-of-the-art electrophysiological tool for recording neural activity with high spatial and temporal resolutions. We first established a surface coating protocol using a cell-permissive hydrogel to stably attach polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic film on the HD-MEA. We then recorded the spontaneous neural activity of the engineered neuronal network, which revealed an important portrait of the engineered neuronal network--modular architecture enhances functional complexity by reducing the excessive neural correlation between spatially segregated modules. The results of this study highlight the impact of HD-MEA recordings combined with cell engineering technologies as a novel tool in neuroscience to constructively assess the structure-function relationships in neuronal networks.",2022-05-09T14:43:08Z,2022-05-11T11:31:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04342v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04342v2,q-bio.NC

We then propose a methodology for extending existing models and their possible application as a fundamental tool in engineering cellular pattern formation. We discuss possible engineering applications of human-defined cell patterns, as well as the potential for using abstract models of chemotaxis for generalised computation, before concluding with a brief discussion of future challenges and opportunities in this field.",2005-12-08T11:28:46Z,2005-12-08T11:28:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0512017v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0512017v1,q-bio.CB

Energy-based Modelling of the Feedback Control of Biomolecular Systems   with Cyclic Flow Modulation,Peter J Gawthrop,"Energy-based modelling brings engineering insight to the understanding of biomolecular systems. It is shown how well-established control engineering concepts, such as loop-gain, arise from energy feedback loops and are therefore amenable to control engineering insight. In particular, a novel method is introduced to allow the transfer function based approach of classical linear control to be utilised in the analysis of feedback systems modelled by network thermodynamics and thus amalgamate energy-based modelling with control systems analysis. The approach is illustrated using a class of metabolic cycles with activation and inhibition leading the concept of Cyclic Flow Modulation.",2020-07-29T12:00:21Z,2021-01-28T11:04:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14762v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14762v3,q-bio.MN
Diverse interactions and ecosystem engineering stabilize community   assembly,"Justin D. Yeakel, Mathias M. Pires, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar, James L. O'Donnell, Paulo R. Guimarães Jr., Dominique Gravel, Thilo Gross","The complexity of an ecological community can be distilled into a network, where diverse interactions connect species in a web of dependencies. Species interact not only with each other but indirectly through environmental effects, however the role of these ecosystem engineers has not yet been considered in models of ecological networks. Here we explore the dynamics of ecosystem assembly, where the colonization and extinction of species within a community depends on the constraints imposed by trophic, service, and engineering dependencies. We show that our assembly model reproduces many key features of ecological systems, such as the role of generalists during assembly, realistic maximum trophic levels, and increased nestedness with higher frequencies of mutualisms. We find that ecosystem engineering has large and nonlinear effects on extinction rates, facilitating robustness by creating niche space, but at the same time increasing the magnitude of extinction cascades. We emphasize the importance of redundancies in engineered effects and show that such redundancy lowers the barriers to colonization, promoting community diversity. Together, our results suggest that ecological engineers may enhance community diversity while increasing persistence by facilitating colonization and limiting competitive exclusion.",2019-08-06T21:18:00Z,2019-08-06T21:18:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02371v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02371v1,q-bio.PE
Prospects for Multi-omics in the Microbial Ecology of Water Engineering,"Elizabeth A. McDaniel, Sebastian Aljoscha Wahl, Shun'ichi Ishii, Ameet Pinto, Ryan Ziels, Per H. Nielsen, Katherine D. McMahon, Rohan B. H. Williams","Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches over almost the last three decades have substantially increased our ability to explore microorganisms and their functions-including those that have yet to be cultivated in pure isolation. Genome-resolved metagenomic approaches have enabled linking powerful functional predictions to specific taxonomical groups with increasing fidelity. Additionally, whole community gene expression surveys and metabolite profiling have permitted direct surveys of community-scale functions in specific environmental settings. These advances have allowed for a shift in microbiome science away from descriptive studies and towards mechanistic and predictive frameworks for designing and harnessing microbial communities for desired beneficial outcomes. Here, we review how modern genome-resolved metagenomic approaches have been applied to a variety of water engineering applications from lab-scale bioreactors to full-scale systems. We describe integrated omics analysis across engineered water systems and the foundations for pairing these insights with modeling approaches. Lastly, we summarize emerging omics-based technologies that we believe will be powerful tools for water engineering applications. Overall, we provide a framework for microbial ecologists specializing in water engineering to apply cutting-edge omics approaches to their research questions to achieve novel functional insights.

The Protein Engineering Tournament: An Open Science Benchmark for   Protein Modeling and Design,"Chase Armer, Hassan Kane, Dana Cortade, Dave Estell, Adil Yusuf, Radhakrishna Sanka, Henning Redestig, TJ Brunette, Pete Kelly, Erika DeBenedictis","The grand challenge of protein engineering is the development of computational models that can characterize and generate protein sequences for any arbitrary function. However, progress today is limited by lack of 1) benchmarks with which to compare computational techniques, 2) large datasets of protein function, and 3) democratized access to experimental protein characterization. Here, we introduce the Protein Engineering Tournament, a fully-remote, biennial competition for the development and benchmarking of computational methods in protein engineering. The tournament consists of two rounds: a first in silico round, where participants use computational models to predict biophysical properties for a set of protein sequences, and a second in vitro round, where participants are challenged to design new protein sequences, which are experimentally measured with open-source, automated methods to determine a winner. At the Tournament's conclusion, the experimental protocols and all collected data will be open-sourced for continued benchmarking and advancement of computational models. We hope the Protein Engineering Tournament will provide a transparent platform with which to evaluate progress in this field and mobilize the scientific community to conquer the grand challenge of computational protein engineering.",2023-09-18T17:26:25Z,2023-09-19T16:47:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09955v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09955v2,q-bio.QM
Hepatocyte Aggregates: Methods of Preparation in the Microgravity   Simulating Bioreactor Use in Tissue Engineering,Veronica Saravia,"Tissue Engineering concerns the three-dimensional cell growth so that bio-artificial tissues could be created and used for transplantation. The recently expressed concerns from the Tissue Engineering research community for a re-direction of the research activities necessitate the proposition of new methodologies. We propose a methodology that has to do with the simulation in bioreactor systems of liver structures as are described in liver anatomy. I this way the hepatocyte microenvironments that determine their function could be re-created in vitro. The approach needs the use of hepatocyte aggregates as entities to load the bioreactor systems. A new bioreactor, the microgravity simulating rotation bioreactor, has been used for the preparation of cell aggregates. Microcontact printing has been used to produce a patterned surfaces. They were tested adsorbing BSA proteins, and will be used in future for the mmobilization of cell aggregates in order to gain further understanding of the role of cell heterogeneity in the cooperative behaviour of cells in vitro.",2008-01-22T14:40:33Z,2008-01-22T14:40:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3382v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3382v1,q-bio.TO
High-Throughput Biologically Optimized Search Engineering Approach to   Synthetic Biology,"A. X. C. N. Valente, Stephen S. Fong","Synthetic Biology is the new engineering-based approach to biology that includes applications of designing complex biological devices. At present, it is not yet clear what will emerge as the defining principles of Synthetic Biology. One proposed approach is to build Synthetic Biology around the classical engineering principles of standardization, modularity/decoupling and abstraction/modeling to facilitate component-based design. In this article we suggest and discuss an alternative paradigm, which we call High-throughput Biologically Optimized Search Engineering (HT-BOSE). Stemming from directed evolution, in HT-BOSE the focal point is a biological knowledge based rational optimization of the search process in the space of device design possibilities. The HT-BOSE approach may also be relevant in other contexts and we briefly highlight how it could be applicable to the development of multi-drug cocktails in a biomedical setting.",2011-03-28T21:17:25Z,2011-03-28T21:17:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5490v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.5490v1,q-bio.QM
Branching actin network remodeling governs the force-velocity   relationship,"Daniel B. Smith, Jian Liu","Actin networks, acting as an engine pushing against an external load, are fundamentally important to cell motility. A measure of the effectiveness of an engine is the velocity the engine is able to produce at a given force, the force-velocity curve. One type of force-velocity curve, consisting of a concave region where velocity is insensitive to increasing force followed by a decrease in velocity, is indicative of an adaptive response. In contrast, an engine whose velocity rapidly decays as a convex curve in response to increasing force would indicate a lack of adaptive response. Even taken outside of a cellular context, branching actin networks have been observed to exhibit both concave and convex force-velocity curves. The exact mechanism that can explain both force-velocity curves is not yet known. We carried out an agent-based stochastic simulation to explore such a mechanism. Our results suggest that upon loading, branching actin networks are capable of remodeling by increasing the number filaments growing against the load. Our model provides a mechanism that can account for both convex and concave force-velocity relationships observed in branching actin networks. Finally, our model gives a potential explanation to the experimentally observed force history dependence for actin network velocity.",2011-11-28T21:15:29Z,2011-11-28T21:15:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6611v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.6611v1,q-bio.SC
A short review on techniques for processes and process simulation of   scaffold-free tissue engineering,Ali Bakhshinejad,"The invention of three-dimensional printers has led to major innovations in tissue engineering. They have enabled the printing of complex geometries such as those that occur in natural tissues, that were not possible with traditional manufacturing techniques. Tissue engineering in particular deals with printing bio-compatible material that may be infused with live cells. Thus additional complexity is incurred because the live cells can migrate and proliferate and thus change the printed geometry. One of the important issues is the prediction of geometry and possibly mechanical properties of the steady state tissue. In this short review, we will provide an overview of different tissue engineering processes that are currently available. Furthermore, we will review two important techniques, namely, Cellular Potts Model (CPM), and Cellular Particle Dynamics (CPD) that have been used to predict the steady state of printed tissue.",2015-11-01T22:17:43Z,2015-11-01T22:17:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00320v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00320v1,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.TO"
Transient temperature calculation method for complex fluid-solid heat   transfer problems with scattering boundary conditions,"Peter Hoelz, Thomas Boehlke, Thomas Kraemer","A calculation method for engine temperatures is presented. Special focus is placed on the transient and scattering boundary conditions within the combustion chamber, including fired and coasting conditions, as well as the dynamic heat transfer of the water jacket. Model reduction is achieved with dimensional analysis and the application of probability density functions, which allows for a timescale separation. Stationary in-cylinder pressure measurements are used as input values and, according to the transient behavior, modified with an own part-load model. A turbocharged SI race engine is equipped with 70 thermocouples at various positions in proximity to the combustion chamber. Differentiating from already published works, the method deals with the transient engine behavior during a race lap, which undergoes a frequency range of 0.1-1 Hz. This includes engine speed build-ups under gear changes, torque variations, or the transition from fired to coasting conditions. Different thermal behaviors of various measuring positions can be simulated successfully. Additionally, cylinder individual temperature effects resulting from an unsymmetrical ignition sequence and different volumetric efficiencies with unequal residual gas can be predicted. Up to a few percent, the energy balance of the water jacket is fulfilled and variations of water inlet temperatures can be simulated accurately enough.",2018-06-01T22:09:32Z,2018-06-01T22:09:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01790v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01790v1,eess.SP
Determining water mass flow control strategies for a turbocharged SI   engine using a two-stage calculation method,"Peter Hoelz, Thomas Boehlke, Thomas Kraemer","Reduction of heat and friction losses is a proven approach to increase the engine efficiency. Therefore, and due to a stabilized, robust combustion, a specific adjustment of component temperatures is desirable in highly transient conditions. In this paper, a turbocharged SI engine is investigated numerically concerning the potential regulation of temperatures, including heat fluxes, only by controlling the water mass flow rate. Using two independent models, a simplified lumped capacity model and a detailed three-dimensional CFD-CHT simulation, an efficient, two-stage calculation method is suggested for an optimized determination of control strategies and their parameters. This complements existing published works which usually control more than one parameter, but use one model. Different control strategies, like feed forward or feedback controllers, are proposed and compared. In addition, a more holistic approach is presented performing a Monte Carlo simulation which evaluates temperatures, as well as hydraulic pumping losses. Using expedient control strategies and parameters, it could be shown that the engine temperatures can be effectively regulated within a wide range. The two different models show partly similar results, and the efficient, two-stage optimization method has proven its worth. However, there are some significant differences between simplified and detailed modelling which are worth mentioning.",2018-06-21T17:52:19Z,2018-06-21T17:52:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08711v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08711v1,eess.SP
Can pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic acid nucleases (pcPNANs) be a   new tool for genetic engineering?,Penghui Shi,"Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) comprise a powerful class of tools that are redefining the boundaries of biological research. Although these technologies have begun to enable targeted genome modifications, there remains a need for new technologies that are affordable, scalable, and easy to engineer. In this paper, we propose a new tool for genetic engineering, the pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic acid nucleases (pcPNANs), which are composed of a pseudocomplementary PNA (pcPNA) specific for a DNA target sequence, a FokI nuclease cleavage domain and a nuclear localization signal. pcPNANs may induce targeted DNA double-strand breaks that activate DNA damage response pathways and enable custom alterations. Their cleavage-site is determined by simple Watson-Crick rule, and thus pcPNANs for aimed cleavage of genomes can be straightforwardly designed and synthesized without any selection procedure. Accordingly, the cleavage-site and site-specificity are freely chosen by changing the sequences and the lengths of pcPNA strands. We believe that the potentiality of pcPNAN as a new tool for genetic engineering will be confirmed in the future.",2014-01-30T07:30:40Z,2014-02-05T01:42:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8223v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.8223v4,q-bio.BM

We propose that the path towards developing the design parameters for biomaterial systems lies with identifying the molecular drivers of emergent behavior through leveraging technological advances in systems biology, including single cell omics, genetic engineering, and high content imaging. This research focus, which we term systems tissue engineering, can uniquely interrogate the mechanisms by which complex tissue behaviors emerge with the potential to capture the contribution of i) dynamic regulation of tissue development and dysregulation, ii) single cell heterogeneity and the function of rare cell types, and iii) the spatial distribution and structure of individual cells and cell types within a tissue.

Machine learning-guided directed evolution for protein engineering,"Kevin K. Yang, Zachary Wu, Frances H. Arnold","Machine learning (ML)-guided directed evolution is a new paradigm for biological design that enables optimization of complex functions. ML methods use data to predict how sequence maps to function without requiring a detailed model of the underlying physics or biological pathways. To demonstrate ML-guided directed evolution, we introduce the steps required to build ML sequence-function models and use them to guide engineering, making recommendations at each stage. This review covers basic concepts relevant to using ML for protein engineering as well as the current literature and applications of this new engineering paradigm. ML methods accelerate directed evolution by learning from information contained in all measured variants and using that information to select sequences that are likely to be improved. We then provide two case studies that demonstrate the ML-guided directed evolution process.

Structural maturation of myofilaments in engineered 3D cardiac   microtissues characterized using small angle X-ray scattering,"Geoffrey van Dover, Josh Javor, Jourdan Ewoldt, Ha Eun Lee, Mikhail Zhernenkov, Guillaume Freychet, Patryk Wasik, Dana Brown, David Bishop, Christopher Chen","Understanding the structural and functional development of human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes is essential to engineering cardiac tissue that enables pharmaceutical testing, modeling diseases, and designing therapies. Here we use a method not commonly applied to biological materials, small angle X-ray scattering, to characterize the structural development of human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes within 3D engineered tissues during their preliminary stages of maturation. An X-ray scattering experimental method enables the reliable characterization of the cardiomyocyte myofilament spacing with maturation time. The myofilament lattice spacing monotonically decreases as the tissue matures from its initial post-seeding state over the span of ten days. Visualization of the spacing at a grid of positions in the tissue provides an approach to characterizing the maturation and organization of cardiomyocyte myofilaments and has the potential to help elucidate mechanisms of pathophysiology, and disease progression, thereby stimulating new biological hypotheses in stem cell engineering.",2023-12-19T22:16:33Z,2023-12-19T22:16:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12628v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12628v1,q-bio.TO
"Auricular Bioelectronic Devices for Health, Medicine, and Human-Computer   Interfaces",William J. Tyler,"Recent advances in manufacturing of flexible and conformable microelectronics have opened opportunities for health monitoring and disease treatment. Other material engineering advances, such as the development of conductive, skin-like hydrogels, liquid metals, electric textiles, and piezoelectric films provide safe and comfortable means of interfacing with the human body. Together, these advances have enabled the design and engineering of bioelectronic devices with integrated multimodal sensing and stimulation capabilities to be worn nearly anywhere on the body. Of particular interest here, the external ear (auricle) offers a unique opportunity to design scalable bioelectronic devices with a high degree of usability and familiarity given the broad use of headphones.

Bridging high resolution sub-cellular imaging with physiologically   relevant engineered tissues,"Yasaman Kargar Gaz Kooh, Nathaniel Huebsch","While high-resolution microscopic techniques are crucial for studying cellular structures in cell biology, obtaining such images from thick 3D engineered tissues remains challenging. In this review, we explore advancements in fluorescence microscopy, alongside the use of various fluorescent probes and material processing techniques to address these challenges. We navigate through the diverse array of imaging options available in tissue engineering field, from wide field to super-resolution microscopy, so researchers can make more informed decisions based on the specific tissue and cellular structures of interest.

Reverse-engineering biological networks from large data sets,"Joseph L. Natale, David Hofmann, Damian G. Hernández, Ilya Nemenman","Much of contemporary systems biology owes its success to the abstraction of a network, the idea that diverse kinds of molecular, cellular, and organismal species and interactions can be modeled as relational nodes and edges in a graph of dependencies. Since the advent of high-throughput data acquisition technologies in fields such as genomics, metabolomics, and neuroscience, the automated inference and reconstruction of such interaction networks directly from large sets of activation data, commonly known as reverse-engineering, has become a routine procedure. Whereas early attempts at network reverse-engineering focused predominantly on producing maps of system architectures with minimal predictive modeling, reconstructions now play instrumental roles in answering questions about the statistics and dynamics of the underlying systems they represent. Many of these predictions have clinical relevance, suggesting novel paradigms for drug discovery and disease treatment. While other reviews focus predominantly on the details and effectiveness of individual network inference algorithms, here we examine the emerging field as a whole. We first summarize several key application areas in which inferred networks have made successful predictions. We then outline the two major classes of reverse-engineering methodologies, emphasizing that the type of prediction that one aims to make dictates the algorithms one should employ. We conclude by discussing whether recent breakthroughs justify the computational costs of large-scale reverse-engineering sufficiently to admit it as a mainstay in the quantitative analysis of living systems.",2017-05-17T23:35:14Z,2017-05-25T00:53:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06370v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06370v2,q-bio.MN
A Robust CNN Framework with Dual Feedback Feature Accumulation for   Detecting Pneumonia Opacity from Chest X-ray Images,"Md. Jahin Alam, Shams Nafisa Ali, Md. Zubair Hasan","Pneumonia is one of the most acute respiratory diseases having remarkably high prevalence and mortality rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) has been widely utilized for the diagnosis of this disease owing to its availability, diagnostic speed and accuracy. However, even for an expert radiologist, it is quite challenging to readily determine pneumonia opacity by examining CXRs. Therefore, this study has been structured to automate the pneumonia detection process by introducing a robust deep learning framework. The proposed network comprises of Process Convolution (Pro_Conv) blocks for feature accumulation inside Dual Feedback (DF) blocks to propagate the feature maps towards a viable detection. Experimental analysis showcase: (1) the proposed network proficiently distinguishes between normal and pneumonia opacity containing CXRs with the mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.78%, 98.84% and 95.04%, respectively; (2) the network is constructed with significantly low parameters than the traditional ImageNets to reduce memory consumption for deployment in memory constrained mobile platforms; (3) the trade-off between accuracy and number of parameters of the model outperforms the considered classical networks by a remarkable margin; and (4) the false-negatives are lower than the false-positives (both of which are low in count) which prove the model's low-fatality prediction. Hence, the proposed network can be deployed for a rapid screening of pneumonia and can act as a great assistive tool for the radiologists in the diagnosis process.",2020-10-05T14:57:19Z,2020-10-05T14:57:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14461v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14461v1,eess.IV
Semi-Streaming Architecture: A New Design Paradigm for CNN   Implementation on FPGAs,"Nazariy K. Shaydyuk, Eugene B. John","The recent research advances in deep learning have led to the development of small and powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Meanwhile Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) has become a popular hardware target choice for their deployment, splitting into two main implementation categories: streaming hardware architectures and single computation engine design approaches. The streaming hardware architectures generally require implementing every layer as a discrete processing unit, and are suitable for smaller software models that could fit in their unfolded versions into resource-constrained targets. On the other hand, single computation engines can be scaled to fit into a device to execute CNN models of different sizes and complexities, however, the achievable performance of one-size-fits-all implementations may vary across CNNs with different workload attributes leading to inefficient utilization of hardware resources. By combing the advantages of both of the above methods, this work proposes a new design paradigm called semi-streaming architecture, where layerspecialized configurable engines are used for network realization. As a proof of concept this paper presents a set of five layerspecialized configurable processing engines for implementing 8-bit quantized MobilenevV2 CNN model. The engines are chained to partially preserve data streaming and tuned individually to efficiently process specific types of layers: normalized addition of residuals, depthwise, pointwise (expansion and projection), and standard 2D convolution layers capable of delivering 5.4GOp/s, 16GOp/s, 27.2GOp/s, 27.2GOp/s and 89.6GOp/s, respectively, with the overall energy efficiency of 5.32GOp/s/W at a 100MHz system clock, requiring total power of 6.2W on a XCZU7EV SoC FPGA.",2020-06-15T20:51:58Z,2020-06-15T20:51:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08759v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08759v1,eess.IV
Reverse engineering neural networks from many partial recordings,"Elahe Arani, Sofia Triantafillou, Konrad P. Kording","Much of neuroscience aims at reverse engineering the brain, but we only record a small number of neurons at a time. We do not currently know if reverse engineering the brain requires us to simultaneously record most neurons or if multiple recordings from smaller subsets suffice. This is made even more important by the development of novel techniques that allow recording from selected subsets of neurons, e.g. using optical techniques. To get at this question, we analyze a neural network, trained on the MNIST dataset, using only partial recordings and characterize the dependency of the quality of our reverse engineering on the number of simultaneously recorded ""neurons"". We find that reverse engineering of the nonlinear neural network is meaningfully possible if a sufficiently large number of neurons is simultaneously recorded but that this number can be considerably smaller than the number of neurons. Moreover, recording many times from small random subsets of neurons yields surprisingly good performance. Application in neuroscience suggests to approximate the I/O function of an actual neural system, we need to record from a much larger number of neurons. The kind of scaling analysis we perform here can, and arguably should be used to calibrate approaches that can dramatically scale up the size of recorded data sets in neuroscience.",2019-07-02T19:15:30Z,2019-07-02T19:15:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01588v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01588v1,q-bio.NC
Improving homology-directed repair by small molecule agents for genetic   engineering in unconventional yeast? -- Learning from the engineering of   mammalian systems,"Min Lu, Sonja Billerbeck","The ability to precisely edit genomes by deleting or adding genetic information enables the study of biological functions and the building of efficient cell factories. In many unconventional yeasts, such as promising new hosts for cell factory design but also human pathogenic yeasts and food spoilers, this progress has been limited by the fact that most yeasts favor non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) over homologous recombination (HR) as DNA repair mechanism, impairing genetic access to these hosts. In mammalian cells, small molecules that either inhibit proteins involved in NHEJ, enhance protein function in HR, or molecules that arrest the cell cycle in HR-dominant phases are regarded as promising agents for the simple and transient increase of HR-mediated genome editing without the need for a priori host engineering. Only a few of these chemicals have been applied to the engineering of yeast although the targeted proteins are mostly conserved; making chemical agents a yet underexplored area in enhancing yeast engineering. Here, we consolidate knowledge of available small molecules that have been used to improve HR efficiency in mammalian cells and the few ones that have been used in yeast. We include available high throughput (HTP)-compatible NHEJ/HR quantification assays that could be used to screen for and isolate yeast-specific inhibitors.",2023-08-29T14:26:13Z,2023-08-29T14:26:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15510v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15510v1,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.BM"

Computational modeling techniques in conjunction with molecular biology techniques have been successful in constructing biological devices such as switches, oscillators, and gates. The ambition of synthetic biology is to construct complex systems from such fundamental devices, much in the same way electronic circuits are built from basic parts. As this ambition becomes a reality, engineering concepts such as interchangeable parts and encapsulation will find their way into biology. We realize that there is a need for computational tools that would support such engineering concepts in biology. As a solution, we have developed the software Athena that allows biological models to be constructed as modules. Modules can be connected to one another without altering the modules themselves.

A Theoretical Mechanism of Szilard Engine Function in Nucleic Acids and   the Implications for Quantum Coherence in Biological Systems,F. Matthew Mihelic,"Nucleic acids theoretically possess a Szilard engine function that can convert the energy associated with the Shannon entropy of molecules for which they have coded recognition, into the useful work of geometric reconfiguration of the nucleic acid molecule. This function is logically reversible because its mechanism is literally and physically constructed out of the information necessary to reduce the Shannon entropy of such molecules, which means that this information exists on both sides of the theoretical engine, and because information is retained in the geometric degrees of freedom of the nucleic acid molecule, a quantum gate is formed through which multi-state nucleic acid qubits can interact. Entangled biophotons emitted as a consequence of symmetry breaking nucleic acid Szilard engine (NASE) function can be used to coordinate relative positioning of different nucleic acid locations, both within and between cells, thus providing the potential for quantum coherence of an entire biological system.

Machine Learning for Protein Function,Dan Ofer,"Systematic identification of protein function is a key problem in current biology. Most traditional methods fail to identify functionally equivalent proteins if they lack similar sequences, structural data or extensive manual annotations. In this thesis, I focused on feature engineering and machine learning methods for identifying diverse classes of proteins that share functional relatedness but little sequence or structural similarity, notably, Neuropeptide Precursors (NPPs).   I aim to identify functional protein classes solely using unannotated protein primary sequences from any organism. This thesis focuses on feature representations of whole protein sequences, sequence derived engineered features, their extraction, frameworks for their usage by machine learning (ML) models, and the application of ML models to biological tasks, focusing on high level protein functions. I implemented the ideas of feature engineering to develop a platform (called NeuroPID) that extracts meaningful features for classification of overlooked NPPs. The platform allows mass discovery of new NPs and NPPs. It was expanded as a webserver.   I expanded our approach towards other challenging protein classes. This is implemented as a novel bioinformatics toolkit called ProFET (Protein Feature Engineering Toolkit). ProFET extracts hundreds of biophysical and sequence derived attributes, allowing the application of machine learning methods to proteins. ProFET was applied on many protein benchmark datasets with state of the art performance. The success of ProFET applies to a wide range of high-level functions such as metagenomic analysis, subcellular localization, structure and unique functional properties (e.g. thermophiles, nucleic acid binding).

It recognizes threats earlier than clinical symptoms manifest and neutralizes antigen with exquisite specificity. Recognition specificity and broad reactivity is enabled via adaptive B- and T-cell receptors: the immune receptor repertoire. The human immune system, however, is not omnipotent. Our natural defense system sometimes loses the battle to parasites and microbes and even turns against us in the case of cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory disease. A long-standing dream of immunoengineers has been, therefore, to mechanistically understand how the immune system sees, reacts and remembers antigens. Only very recently, experimental and computational methods have achieved sufficient quantitative resolution to start querying and engineering adaptive immunity with great precision. In specific, these innovations have been applied with the greatest fervency and success in immunotherapy, autoimmunity and vaccine design.

Authentication methods are used widely in portable devices since the lifetime of battery and time response are essential concerns in these devices.

Role of connectivity anisotropies in the dynamics of cultured neuronal   networks,"Akke Mats Houben, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi Soriano","Laboratory-grown, engineered living neuronal networks in vitro have emerged in the last years as an experimental technique to understand the collective behavior of neuronal assemblies in relation to their underlying connectivity. An inherent obstacle in the design of such engineered systems is the difficulty to predict the dynamic repertoire of the emerging network and its dependence on experimental variables. To fill this gap, and inspired on recent experimental studies, here we present a numerical model that aims at, first, replicating the anisotropies in connectivity imprinted through engineering, to next realize the collective behavior of the neuronal network and make predictions. We use experimentally measured, biologically-realistic data combined with the Izhikevich model to quantify the dynamics of the neuronal network in relation to tunable structural and dynamical parameters. These parameters include the synaptic noise, strength of the imprinted anisotropies, and average axon lengths. The latter are involved in the simulation of the development of neurons in vitro. We show that the model captures the behavior of engineered neuronal cultures, in which a rich repertoire of activity patterns emerge but whose details are strongly dependent on connectivity details and noise. Results also show that the presence of connectivity anisotropies substantially improves the capacity of reconstructing structural connectivity from activity data, an aspect that is important in the quest for understanding the structure-to-function relationship in neuronal networks. Our work provides the in silico basis to assist experimentalists in the design of laboratory in vitro networks and anticipate their outcome, an aspect that is particularly important in the effort to conceive reliable brain-on-a-chip circuits and explore key aspects such as input-output relationships or information coding.",2025-01-08T11:21:40Z,2025-01-08T11:21:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04427v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04427v1,q-bio.NC
A Computational Algebra Approach to the Reverse Engineering of Gene   Regulatory Networks,"Reinhard Laubenbacher, Brandilyn Stigler","This paper proposes a new method to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks from experimental data. The modeling framework used is time-discrete deterministic dynamical systems, with a finite set of states for each of the variables. The simplest examples of such models are Boolean networks, in which variables have only two possible states. The use of a larger number of possible states allows a finer discretization of experimental data and more than one possible mode of action for the variables, depending on threshold values. Furthermore, with a suitable choice of state set, one can employ powerful tools from computational algebra, that underlie the reverse-engineering algorithm, avoiding costly enumeration strategies. To perform well, the algorithm requires wildtype together with perturbation time courses. This makes it suitable for small to meso-scale networks rather than networks on a genome-wide scale. The complexity of the algorithm is quadratic in the number of variables and cubic in the number of time points.

Bond Graph Modelling of Chemiosmotic Biomolecular Energy Transduction,Peter Gawthrop,"Engineering systems modelling and analysis based on the bond graph approach has been applied to biomolecular systems. In this context, the notion of a Faraday-equivalent chemical potential is introduced which allows chemical potential to be expressed in an analogous manner to electrical volts thus allowing engineering intuition to be applied to biomolecular systems. Redox reactions, and their representation by half-reactions, are key components of biological systems which involve both electrical and chemical domains. A bond graph interpretation of redox reactions is given which combines bond graphs with the Faraday- equivalent chemical potential. This approach is particularly relevant when the biomolecular system implements chemoelectrical transduction - for example chemiosmosis within the key metabolic pathway of mitochondria: oxidative phosphorylation. An alternative way of implementing computational modularity using bond graphs is introduced and used to give a physically based model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. To illustrate the overall approach, this model is analysed using the Faraday-equivalent chemical potential approach and engineering intuition is used to guide affinity equalisation: a energy based analysis of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.",2016-11-14T06:57:38Z,2017-02-22T00:33:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04264v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04264v2,q-bio.MN

Nowadays, designing a high performance VCO for different applications is a challenging task for engineers. Moreover, up to now many designs and solutions have been proposed by the scientists to improve the performance of VCOs to be exploited in different cutting-edge applications.

Digital Twin Enabled Smart Control Engineering as an Industrial AI: A   New Framework and A Case Study,"Jairo Viola, YangQuan Chen","In the way towards Industry 4.0, the complexity of the industrial systems increases due to the presence of multiple agents, Cyber-Physical Systems, distributed sensing, and big data introducing unknown dynamics that affect the production goals of the manufacturing processes.

The ARF-AID system: Methods that preserve endogenous protein levels and   facilitate rapidly inducible protein degradation,"Kizhakke Mattada Sathyan, Thomas G. Scott, Michael J. Guertin","The ARF-AID (Auxin Response Factor-Auxin Inducible Degron) system is a re-engineered auxin-inducible protein degradation system. Inducible degron systems are widely used to specifically and rapidly deplete proteins of interest in cell lines and organisms. An advantage of inducible degradation is that the biological system under study remains intact and functional until perturbation. This feature necessitates that the endogenous levels of the protein are maintained. However, endogenous tagging of genes with AID can result in chronic, auxin-independent proteasome-mediated degradation. The additional expression of the ARF-PB1 domain in the re-engineered ARF-AID system prevents chronic degradation of AID-tagged proteins while preserving rapid degradation of tagged proteins. Here we describe the protocol for engineering human cell lines to implement the ARF-AID system for specific and inducible protein degradation. These methods are adaptable and can be extended from cell lines to organisms.",2020-02-28T17:32:09Z,2020-02-28T17:32:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12883v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12883v1,q-bio.QM
CAD Applications and Emerging Research Potential in Medical Imaging,"Roshan P.

Many reviewers have emphasized the need for synergy between engineers and medical professionals for successful development of CAD systems and the current work is a move in that direction. The engineering aspects of the above four stages in four imaging modalities viz. computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, mammography and bone scintigraphy used in the diagnosis of five critical diseases have been discussed with a clinical background. Automatic classification of image can play an important role in preliminary screening of very critical ailments bringing down the cost of health care.

However, current paradigms in the field entangle sequence and functionality in a manner that makes abstraction difficult, reduces engineering flexibility, and impairs predictability and design reuse. Functional Synthetic Biology aims to overcome these impediments by focusing the design of biological systems on function, rather than on sequence. This reorientation will decouple the engineering of biological devices from the specifics of how those devices are put to use, requiring both conceptual and organizational change, as well as supporting software tooling.

Disentangled Wasserstein Autoencoder for T-Cell Receptor Engineering,"Tianxiao Li, Hongyu Guo, Filippo Grazioli, Mark Gerstein, Martin Renqiang Min","In protein biophysics, the separation between the functionally important residues (forming the active site or binding surface) and those that create the overall structure (the fold) is a well-established and fundamental concept. Identifying and modifying those functional sites is critical for protein engineering but computationally non-trivial, and requires significant domain knowledge. To automate this process from a data-driven perspective, we propose a disentangled Wasserstein autoencoder with an auxiliary classifier, which isolates the function-related patterns from the rest with theoretical guarantees. This enables one-pass protein sequence editing and improves the understanding of the resulting sequences and editing actions involved. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply it to T-cell receptors (TCRs), a well-studied structure-function case. We show that our method can be used to alter the function of TCRs without changing the structural backbone, outperforming several competing methods in generation quality and efficiency, and requiring only 10% of the running time needed by baseline models. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that utilizes disentangled representations for TCR engineering.",2022-10-15T02:59:05Z,2023-10-16T17:05:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08171v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08171v2,q-bio.BM

Based on interferences between the successive delayed and amplified output signals associated respectively with the impulses constituting the input signal, the taches-algorithm can give access immediately to the new output sample and have a low latency response even without using vector-based optimisation of the calculation. With the taches-algorithm it seems easy to change (even in real-time) the impulse response while running the calculation, simply by updating the impulse response to use it for next samples, a task rather difficult to achieve using FFT convolution. Real-time audio demonstrations using notably Pure Data and simple explanations of the taches-algorithm will be given.Paper 7412 presented at the 125th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society, Amsterdam, 2008",2024-01-03T08:22:57Z,2024-01-03T08:22:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01607v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01607v1,eess.SP
Revisiting proximity effect using broadband signals,"Laurent Millot, Mohammed Elliq, Manuel Lopes, Gérard Pelé, Dominique Lambert","Experiments studying mainly proximity effect are presented. Pink noise and music were used as stimuli and a combo guitar amplifier as source to test several microphones: omnidirectional and directional. We plot in-axis levels and spectral balances as functions of x, the distance to the source. Proximity effect was found for omnidirectional microphones. In-axis level curves show that 1/x law seems poorly valid. Spectral balance evolutions depend on microphones and moreover on stimuli: bigger decreases of low frequencies with pink noise; larger increases of other frequencies with music. For a naked loudspeaker, we found similar in-axis level curves under and above the cut-off frequency and propose an explanation. Listening equalized music recordings will help to demonstrate proximity effect for tested microphones.Paper 7106 presented at the 122th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society, Wien, 2007",2024-01-11T08:42:23Z,2024-01-11T08:42:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14410v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14410v1,"eess.AS, eess.SP"
"Quantitative Aspects, Engineering and Optimization of Bacterial Sensor   Systems","Florian Anderl, Gabriela Salvadori, Mladen Veletic, Fernanda Cristina Petersen, Ilangko Balasingham","Bacterial sensor systems can be used for the detection and measurement of molecular signal concentrations. The dynamics of the sensor directly depend on the biological properties of the bacterial sensor cells; manipulation of these features in the wet lab enables the engineering and optimization of the bacterial sensor kinetics. This necessitates the development of biologically meaningful computational models for bacterial sensors comprising a variety of different molecular mechanisms, which further facilitates a systematic and quantitative evaluation of optimization strategies. In this work, we dissect the detection chain of bacterial sensors from a mathematical perspective from which we derive, supported by wet-lab data, a complete computational model for a Streptococcus mutans-based bacterial sensor as a case example. We address the engineering of bacterial sensors by investigating the impact of altered bacterial cell properties on the sensor response characteristics, specifically sensor sensitivity and response signal intensity. This is achieved through a sensitivity analysis targeting both the steady-state and transient sensor response characteristics. Alongside the demonstration of suitability of our methodological approach, our analysis shows that an increase of sensor sensitivity, through a targeted manipulation of bacterial physiology, often comes at the cost of generally diminished sensor response intensity.",2024-06-24T20:08:50Z,2024-06-24T20:08:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17116v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17116v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM"

Learning to engineer protein flexibility,"Petr Kouba, Joan Planas-Iglesias, Jiri Damborsky, Jiri Sedlar, Stanislav Mazurenko, Josef Sivic","Generative machine learning models are increasingly being used to design novel proteins for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. However, the current methods mostly focus on the design of proteins with a fixed backbone structure, which leads to their limited ability to account for protein flexibility, one of the crucial properties for protein function. Learning to engineer protein flexibility is problematic because the available data are scarce, heterogeneous, and costly to obtain using computational as well as experimental methods. Our contributions to address this problem are three-fold. First, we comprehensively compare methods for quantifying protein flexibility and identify data relevant to learning. Second, we design and train flexibility predictors utilizing sequential or both sequential and structural information on the input. We overcome the data scarcity issue by leveraging a pre-trained protein language model. Third, we introduce a method for fine-tuning a protein inverse folding model to steer it toward desired flexibility in specified regions. We demonstrate that our method Flexpert-Design enables guidance of inverse folding models toward increased flexibility.

Real-Time Prediction of Gas Flow Dynamics in Diesel Engines using a Deep   Neural Operator Framework,"Varun Kumar, Somdatta Goswami, Daniel J. Smith, George Em Karniadakis","We develop a data-driven deep neural operator framework to approximate multiple output states for a diesel engine and generate real-time predictions with reasonable accuracy. As emission norms become more stringent, the need for fast and accurate models that enable analysis of system behavior have become an essential requirement for system development. The fast transient processes involved in the operation of a combustion engine make it difficult to develop accurate physics-based models for such systems. As an alternative to physics based models, we develop an operator-based regression model (DeepONet) to learn the relevant output states for a mean-value gas flow engine model using the engine operating conditions as input variables. We have adopted a mean-value model as a benchmark for comparison, simulated using Simulink. The developed approach necessitates using the initial conditions of the output states to predict the accurate sequence over the temporal domain. To this end, a sequence-to-sequence approach is embedded into the proposed framework. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the prediction output to ground truth generated from Simulink model. The maximum $\mathcal L_2$ relative error observed was approximately $6.5\%$. The sensitivity of the DeepONet model is evaluated under simulated noise conditions and the model shows relatively low sensitivity to noise. The uncertainty in model prediction is further assessed by using a mean ensemble approach. The worst-case error at the $(\mu + 2\sigma)$ boundary was found to be $12\%$. The proposed framework provides the ability to predict output states in real-time and enables data-driven learning of complex input-output operator mapping. As a result, this model can be applied during initial development stages, where accurate models may not be available.",2023-04-02T16:24:04Z,2023-07-06T15:00:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00567v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.00567v2,eess.SP
A statistical mechanics approach to reverse engineering: sparsity and   biological priors on gene regulatory networks,"Massimo Pica Ciamarra, Gennaro Miele, Leopoldo Milano, Mario Nicodemi, Giancarlo Raiconi","The important task of determining the connectivity of gene networks, and at a more detailed level even the kind of interaction existing between genes, can nowadays be tackled by microarraylike technologies. Yet, there is still a large amount of unknowns with respect to the amount of data provided by a single microarray experiment, and therefore reliable gene network retrieval procedures must integrate all of the available biological knowledge, even if coming from different sources and of different nature. In this paper we present a reverse engineering algorithm able to reveal the underlying gene network by using time-series dataset on gene expressions considering the system response to different perturbations. The approach is able to determine the sparsity of the gene network, and to take into account possible {\it a priori} biological knowledge on it. The validity of the reverse engineering approach is highlighted through the deduction of the topology of several {\it simulated} gene networks, where we also discuss how the performance of the algorithm improves enlarging the amount of data or if any a priori knowledge is considered.

"Cell-cycle-synchronized, oscillatory expression of a negatively   autoregulated gene in E. coli","Zach Hensel, Tatiana T. Marquez-Lago","Engineering genetic networks to be both predictable and robust is a key challenge in synthetic biology. Synthetic circuits must reliably function in dynamic, stochastic and heterogeneous environments, and simple circuits can be studied to refine complex gene-regulation models. Although robust behaviours such as genetic oscillators have been designed and implemented in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, a priori genetic engineering of even simple networks remains difficult, and many aspects of cell and molecular biology critical to engineering robust networks are still inadequately characterized. Particularly, periodic processes such as gene doubling and cell division are rarely considered in gene regulatory models, which may become more important as synthetic biologists utilize new tools for chromosome integration. We studied a chromosome-integrated, negative-feedback circuit based upon the bacteriophage {\lambda} transcriptional repressor Cro and observed strong, feedback-dependent oscillations in single-cell time traces. This finding was surprising due to a lack of cooperativity, long delays or fast protein degradation. We further show that oscillations are synchronized to the cell cycle by gene duplication, with phase shifts predictably correlating with estimated gene doubling times. Furthermore, we characterized the influence of negative feedback on the magnitude and dynamics of noise in gene expression. Our results show that cell-cycle effects must be accounted for in accurate, predictive models for even simple gene circuits. Cell-cycle-periodic expression of {\lambda} Cro also suggests an explanation for cell-size dependence in lysis probability and an evolutionary basis for site-specific {\lambda} integration.",2015-06-29T12:00:24Z,2015-06-29T12:00:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08596v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08596v1,q-bio.QM
"Analytic and Numerical Models of Oxygen and Nutrient Diffusion,   Metabolism Dynamics, and Architecture Optimization in Three-Dimensional   Tissue Constructs with Applications and Insights in Cerebral Organoids",Richard J. McMurtrey,"Diffusion models are important in tissue engineering as they enable an understanding of molecular delivery to cells in tissue constructs. As three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs become larger, more intricate, and more clinically applicable, it will be essential to understand internal dynamics and signaling molecule concentrations throughout the tissue. Diffusion characteristics present a significant limitation in many engineered tissues, particularly for avascular tissues and for cells whose viability, differentiation, or function are affected by concentrations of oxygen and nutrients. This paper seeks to provide novel analytic solutions for certain cases of steady-state and non-steady-state diffusion and metabolism in 3D construct designs (planar, cylindrical, and spherical forms), solutions that otherwise require mathematical approximations achieved through numerical methods. This model is applied to cerebral organoids, where it is shown that limitations in diffusion and organoid size can be partially overcome by localizing metabolically-active cells to an outer layer in a sphere, a regionalization process that is known to occur through neuroglial precursor migration both in organoids and in early brain development. The given prototypical solutions include a review of metabolic information for many cell types and can be broadly applied to many forms of tissue constructs. This work enables researchers to model oxygen and nutrient delivery to cells, predict cell viability, design constructs with improved diffusion capabilities, and accurately control molecular concentrations in tissue constructs that may be used in studying models of development and disease or for conditioning cells to enhance survival after insults like ischemia or implantation into the body, thereby providing a framework for better understanding and exploring the characteristics of engineered tissue constructs.",2015-12-21T02:30:48Z,2015-12-21T02:30:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06475v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06475v1,q-bio.TO

The present study explores the potential of low dose BMP-2 treatment via tissue engineering approach, which amalgamates 3-D macro/microporous-nanofibrous bacterial cellulose (mNBC) scaffolds and low dose BMP-2 primed murine mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T1/2 cells). Initial studies on cell-scaffold interaction using unprimed C3H10T1/2 cells confirmed that scaffolds provided a propitious environment for cell adhesion, growth, and infiltration, owing to its ECM-mimicking nano-micro-macro architecture. Osteogenic studies were conducted by preconditioning the cells with 50 ng/mL BMP-2 for 15 minutes, followed by culturing on mNBC scaffolds for up to three weeks. The results showed an early onset and significantly enhanced bone matrix secretion and maturation in the scaffolds seeded with BMP-2 primed cells compared to the unprimed ones. Moreover, mNBC scaffolds alone were able to facilitate the mineralization of cells to some extent. These findings suggest that, with the aid of 'osteoinduction' from low dose BMP-2 priming of stem cells and 'osteoconduction' from nano-macro/micro topography of mNBC scaffolds, a cost-effective bone tissue engineering strategy can be designed for quick and excellent in vivo osseointegration.",2020-09-14T11:56:45Z,2020-11-23T10:39:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06338v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06338v2,"q-bio.BM, q-bio.TO"

Theoretically, muscle stiffness and damping in the arm can be estimated using a mass-spring-damper (MSD) biomechanical model. However, the damping frequency (i.e., stiffness) and damping ratio values derived using LPC were not yet compared with those from a theoretical MSD model. This work demonstrates that the damping frequency and damping ratio from LPC are significantly correlated with those from an MSD model, thus confirming the validity of using LPC to infer muscle stiffness and damping. We also compare the stress level binary classification performance using the values from LPC and MSD with each other and with neural network-based baselines.

Acceleration of Evolutionary Processes by Learning and Extended Fisher's   Fundamental Theorem,"So Nakashima, Tetsuya J. Kobayashi","Natural selection is general and powerful concept not only to explain evolutionary processes of biological organisms but also to design engineering systems such as genetic algorithms and particle filters. There is a surge of interest, both from biology and engineering, in considering natural selection of intellectual agents that can learn individually. Learning by individual agents of better behaviors for survival may accelerate the evolutionary processes by natural selection. We have accumulating pieces of evidence that organisms can transmit its information to the next generation via epigenetic states or memes. Also, such idea is important for engineering applications. To accelerate the evolutionary process, an agent should change their strategy so that the population fitness increases the most. Equivalently, an agent should update the strategy towards a gradient of the population fitness. However, it has not yet been clarified whether and how an agent can estimate the gradient and accelerate the evolutionary process. We also lack methodology to quantify the acceleration to understand and predict the impact of learning. In this paper, we address these problems. We show that an learning agent can accelerate the evolutionary process by proposing ancestral learning, which uses the information transmitted from the ancestor (ancestral information). We next show that the ancestral information is sufficient to estimate the gradient. In particular, learning can accelerate the evolutionary process without communications between agents. Finally, to quantify the acceleration, we extend the Fisher's fundamental theorem (FF-thm) for natural selection to ancestral learning.

HYPERION: Hyperspectral Penetrating-type Ellipsoidal Reconstruction for   Terahertz Blind Source Separation,"Chia-Hsiang Lin, Yi-Chun Hung, Feng-Yu Wang, Shang-Hua Yang","Terahertz (THz) technology has been a great candidate for applications, including pharmaceutic analysis, chemical identification, and remote sensing and imaging due to its non-invasive and non-destructive properties. Among those applications, penetrating-type hyperspectral THz signals, which provide crucial material information, normally involve a noisy, complex mixture system. Additionally, the measured THz signals could be ill-conditioned due to the overlap of the material absorption peak in the measured bands. To address those issues, we consider penetrating-type signal mixtures and aim to develop a blind hyperspectral unmixing (HU) method without requiring any information from a prebuilt database. The proposed HYperspectral Penetrating-type Ellipsoidal ReconstructION (HYPERION) algorithm is unsupervised, not relying on collecting extensive data or sophisticated model training. Instead, it is developed based on elegant ellipsoidal geometry under a very mild requirement on data purity, whose excellent efficacy is experimentally demonstrated.",2021-09-12T04:13:34Z,2022-04-03T14:13:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05425v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05425v3,eess.SP
LAPIS is a fast web API for massive open virus sequencing databases,"Chaoran Chen, Alexander Taepper, Fabian Engelniederhammer, Jonas Kellerer, Cornelius Roemer, Tanja Stadler","Background: Recent epidemic outbreaks such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the mpox outbreak in 2022 have demonstrated the value of genomic sequencing data for tracking the origin and spread of pathogens. Laboratories around the globe generated new sequences at unprecedented speed and volume and bioinformaticians developed new tools and dashboards to analyze this wealth of data. However, a major challenge that remains is the lack of simple and efficient approaches for accessing and processing sequencing data.   Results: The Lightweight API for Sequences (LAPIS) facilitates rapid retrieval and analysis of genomic sequencing data through a REST API. It supports complex mutation- and metadata-based queries and can perform aggregation operations on massive datasets. LAPIS is optimized for typical questions relevant to genomic epidemiology. Using a newly-developed in-memory database engine, it has a high speed and throughput: between 25 January and 4 February 2023, the SARS-CoV-2 instance of LAPIS, which contains 14.5 million sequences, processed over 20 million requests with a mean response time of 411 ms and a median response time of 1 ms. LAPIS is the core engine behind our dashboards on genspectrum.org and we currently maintain public LAPIS instances for SARS-CoV-2 and mpox.   Conclusions: Powered by an optimized database engine and available through a web API, LAPIS enhances the accessibility of genomic sequencing data. It is designed to serve as a common backend for dashboards and analyses with the potential to be integrated into common database platforms such as GenBank.",2022-06-02T11:15:56Z,2023-05-18T14:58:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01210v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01210v4,q-bio.GN
Engineering Semantic Communication: A Survey,"Dylan Wheeler, Balasubramaniam Natarajan","As the global demand for data has continued to rise exponentially, some have begun turning to the idea of semantic communication as a means of efficiently meeting this demand. Pushing beyond the boundaries of conventional communication systems, semantic communication focuses on the accurate recovery of the meaning conveyed from source to receiver, as opposed to the accurate recovery of transmitted symbols. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the history and current state of semantic communication and the techniques for engineering this higher level of communication. A survey of the current literature reveals four broad approaches to engineering semantic communication. We term the earliest of these approaches classical semantic information, which seeks to extend information-theoretic results to include semantic information. A second approach makes use of knowledge graphs to achieve semantic communication, and a third utilizes the power of modern deep learning techniques to facilitate this communication. The fourth approach focuses on the significance of information, rather than its meaning, to achieve efficient, goal-oriented communication. We discuss each of these four approaches and their corresponding studies in detail, and provide some challenges and opportunities that pertain to each approach. Finally, we introduce a novel approach to semantic communication, which we term context-based semantic communication. Inspired by the way in which humans naturally communicate with one another, this context-based approach provides a general, optimization-based design framework for semantic communication systems. Together, this survey provides a useful guide for the design and implementation of semantic communication systems.",2022-08-12T14:59:07Z,2022-10-04T13:41:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06314v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06314v2,eess.SP
Sweet Streams are Made of This: The System Engineer's View on Energy   Efficiency in Video Communications,"Christian Herglotz, Matthias Kränzler, Robert Schober, André Kaup","In recent years, the global use of online video services has increased rapidly. Today, a manifold of applications, such as video streaming, video conferencing, live broadcasting, and social networks, make use of this technology. A recent study found that the development and the success of these services had as a consequence that, nowadays, more than 1% of the global greenhouse-gas emissions are related to online video, with growth rates close to 10% per year. This article reviews the latest findings concerning energy consumption of online video from the system engineer's perspective, where the system engineer is the designer and operator of a typical online video service. We discuss all relevant energy sinks, highlight dependencies with quality-of-service variables as well as video properties, review energy consumption models for different devices from the literature, and aggregate these existing models into a global model for the overall energy consumption of a generic online video service. Analyzing this model and its implications, we find that end-user devices and video encoding have the largest potential for energy savings. Finally, we provide an overview of recent advances in energy efficiency improvement for video streaming and propose future research directions for energy-efficient video streaming services.",2022-09-30T12:04:30Z,2022-09-30T12:04:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15405v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15405v1,eess.IV
A CNN based Multifaceted Signal Processing Framework for Heart Rate   Proctoring Using Millimeter Wave Radar Ballistocardiography,"Rafid Umayer Murshed, Md. Abrar Istiak, Md. Toufiqur Rahman, Zulqarnain B Ashraf, Md Saheed Ullah, Mohammad Saquib","The recent pandemic has refocused the medical world's attention on the diagnostic techniques associated with cardiovascular disease. Heart rate provides a real-time snapshot of cardiovascular health. A more precise heart rate reading provides a better understanding of cardiac muscle activity. Although many existing diagnostic techniques are approaching the limits of perfection, there remains potential for further development. In this paper, we propose MIBINET, a convolutional neural network for real-time proctoring of heart rate via inter-beat-interval (IBI) from millimeter wave (mm-wave) radar ballistocardiography signals. This network can be used in hospitals, homes, and passenger vehicles due to its lightweight and contactless properties. It employs classical signal processing prior to fitting the data into the network. Although MIBINET is primarily designed to work on mm-wave signals, it is found equally effective on signals of various modalities such as PCG, ECG, and PPG. Extensive experimental results and a thorough comparison with the current state-of-the-art on mm-wave signals demonstrate the viability and versatility of the proposed methodology.

Energy Beamforming for RF Wireless Power Transfer with Dynamic   Metasurface Antennas,"Amirhossein Azarbahram, Onel L. A. Lopez, Richard D. Souza, Rui Zhang, Matti Latva-Aho","Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology for charging the Internet of Things. Practical RF-WPT systems usually require energy beamforming (EB), which can compensate for the severe propagation loss by directing beams toward the devices. The EB flexibility depends on the transmitter architecture, existing a trade-off between cost/complexity and degrees of freedom. Thus, simpler architectures such as dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are gaining attention. Herein, we consider an RF-WPT system with a transmit DMA for meeting the energy harvesting requirements of multiple devices and formulate an optimization problem for the minimum-power design. First, we provide a mathematical model to capture the frequency-dependant signal propagation effect in the DMA architecture. Next, we propose a solution based on semi-definite programming and alternating optimization. Results show that a DMA-based structure can outperform a fully-digital implementation and that the required transmit power decreases with the antenna array size, while it increases and remains almost constant with frequency in DMA and FD, respectively.",2023-07-03T15:05:46Z,2023-12-13T15:01:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01082v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01082v2,eess.SP
Numerical modeling of hydrogel scaffold anisotropy during   extrusion-based 3D printing for tissue engineering,"V. T. Mai, R. Chatelin, E. -J. Courtial, C. Boulocher, R. Rieger","Extrusion-based 3D printing is a widely utilized tool in tissue engineering, offering precise 3D control of bioinks to construct organ-sized biomaterial objects with hierarchically organized cellularized scaffolds. The internal organization of scaffold constituents must replicate the structural anisotropy of the targeted tissue to effectively promote cellular behavior during 3D cell culture. The choice of polymers in the bioink and extrusion process topological properties significantly impact tissue engineering constructs' structural anisotropy and cellular response. Our study employed a hydrogel bioink consisting of fibrinogen, alginate, and gelatin, providing biocompatibility, printability, and shape retention post-printing. Topological properties in flowing polymers are determined by macromolecule conformation, namely orientation and stretch degree. We utilized the micro-macro approach to describe hydrogel macromolecule orientation during extrusion, offering a two-scale fluid behavior description. The study aimed to use the Fokker-Planck equation to represent constituent population (polymer chain) state within a hydrogel's representative elementary volume during extrusion-based 3D printing. Our findings indicate that a high shear rate drives constituent orientation in tubular nozzle syringe setups, overcoming fluid rheological behavior. Additionally, the interaction coefficient (C_i), representing microscopic fluid particle interaction, surpasses hydrogel behavior for constituent orientation prediction. This approach provides an initial but robust framework to model scaffold anisotropy, enabling optimization of the extrusion process while maintaining computational feasibility.",2023-10-04T11:14:26Z,2024-12-28T11:12:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02734v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02734v4,"q-bio.TO, q-bio.MN"

Quandt","In the development of any type of magnetic field sensor based on magnetic films, special consideration must be given to the magnetic layer component. The presented work investigates the use of flux closing magnetostrictive multilayers for inverse magnetoelectric sensors. In such a type of magnetic field sensor, highly sensitive AC and DC field detection relies on strong excitation of the incorporated magnetic layers by piezoelectrically driven cantilever oscillation at mechanical resonances. The provoked periodic flux change is influenced by the magnetic field to be measured and is picked up by a coil, which generates the measured output. The effect of the magnetic multilayer on linearity, noise behavior, and detection limit of DC and AC signals is investigated. This study demonstrates the next step for inverse magnetoelectric thin film sensors, which achieve one order of magnitude improved detection limits with less than $8 pT/Hz^{1/2}$ at $10 Hz$ and $18 pT/Hz^{1/2}$ at $DC$ using exchange bias stabilized magnetic multilayers for obtaining flux closure.",2023-12-08T11:59:26Z,2023-12-08T11:59:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04988v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04988v1,eess.SP
Multiple-Frequency-Bands Channel Characterization for In-vehicle   Wireless Networks,"Mengting Li, Yifa Li, Qiyu Zeng, Kim Olesen, Fengchun Zhang, Wei Fan","In-vehicle wireless networks are crucial for advancing smart transportation systems and enhancing interaction among vehicles and their occupants. However, there are limited studies in the current state of the art that investigate the in-vehicle channel characteristics in multiple frequency bands. In this paper, we present measurement campaigns conducted in a van and a car across below 7 GHz, millimeter-wave (mmWave), and sub-Terahertz (Sub-THz) bands. These campaigns aim to compare the channel characteristics for in-vehicle scenarios across various frequency bands. Channel impulse responses (CIRs) were measured at various locations distributed across the engine compartment of both the van and car. The CIR results reveal a high similarity in the delay properties between frequency bands below 7GHz and mmWave bands for the measurements in the engine bay. Sparse channels can be observed at Sub-THz bands in the engine bay scenarios. Channel spatial profiles in the passenger cabin of both the van and car are obtained by the directional scan sounding scheme for three bands. We compare the power angle delay profiles (PADPs) measured at different frequency bands in two line of sight (LOS) scenarios and one non-LOS (NLOS) scenario. Some major \added{multipath components (MPCs)} can be identified in all frequency bands and their trajectories are traced based on the geometry of the vehicles. The angular spread of arrival is also calculated for three scenarios. The analysis of channel characteristics in this paper can enhance our understanding of in-vehicle channels and foster the evolution of in-vehicle wireless networks.",2024-10-03T11:42:23Z,2024-10-03T11:42:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02410v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02410v1,eess.SP

The agent's ability to process intuitive natural language queries reduces technical barriers, allowing researchers to efficiently access and analyze complex biological data without requiring extensive bioinformatics expertise. Through detailed case studies in literature retrieval and protein structure visualization, we demonstrate TourSynbio-Search's effectiveness in streamlining biological information retrieval and enhancing research productivity.

The challenges in creating such devices, however are that they must be integrated with cells in a precise kinetically controlled process and a device's structure and its precisely structured cell interface must then be maintained during active cellular function. Here we report the ability to integrate synthetic micro-scale filaments, DNA nanotubes, into a cell's architecture by anchoring them by their ends to specific receptors on the surfaces of mammalian cells. These filaments can act as shear stress meters: how anchored nanotubes bend at the cell surface quantitatively indicates the magnitude of shear stresses between 0-2 dyn per cm2, a regime important for cell signaling. Nanotubes can also grow while anchored to cells, thus acting as dynamic components of cells.

These parameters are transfered into an adjacent matrix, which is analyzed with respect to topological properties and biological relevance. We find a very broad distribution of outdegrees in the network, compatible with earlier findings for biological systems and totally incompatible with a random graph, and also indications of modules in the network.
