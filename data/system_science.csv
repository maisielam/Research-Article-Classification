Impact of JD Bernal Thoughts in the Science of Science upon China:   Implications for Quantitative Studies of Science Today,"Yong Zhao, Jian Du, Yishan Wu","John Desmond Bernal (1901-1970) was one of the most eminent scientists in molecular biology, and also regarded as the founding father of the Science of Science. His book The Social Function of Science laid the theoretical foundations for the discipline. In this article, we summarize four chief characteristics of his ideas in the Science of Science: the socio-historical perspective, theoretical models, qualitative and quantitative approaches, and studies of science planning and policy. China has constantly reformed its scientific and technological system based on research evidence of the Science of Science. Therefore, we analyze the impact of Bernal Science-of-Science thoughts on the development of Science of Science in China, and discuss how they might be usefully taken still further in quantitative studies of science.",2020-03-03T02:29:11Z,2020-03-05T06:38:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02135v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02135v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.DL, physics.hist-ph"
A Lesson from the James Webb Space Telescope: Early Engagement with   Future Astrophysics Great Observatories Maximizes their Solar System Science,"Heidi B. Hammel, Stefanie N. Milam","Astrophysics facilities have been of tremendous importance for planetary science. The flagship space observatory Hubble Space Telescope has produced ground-breaking Solar System science, but when launched it did not even have the capability to track moving targets. The next astrophysics flagship mission, the James Webb Space Telescope, included Solar System scientists in its science team from the earliest days, with the result that Webb will launch with a diverse program and capabilities for Solar System exploration. The New Great Observatories, as well as future ground-based facilities, offer the opportunity for a robust suite of observations that will complement, enhance, and enable future Solar System exploration. We encourage the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey to overtly acknowledge the prospects for excellent Solar System science with the next generation of astrophysics facilities. We hope the Planetary Decadal will further encourage these missions to continue to formally involve Solar System scientists in the science working groups and development teams.",2020-07-16T20:36:24Z,2020-07-16T20:36:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08618v1,"astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP"
The Globalization of Science: The Increasing Power of Individual   Scientists,Marek Kwiek,"National science systems have become embedded in global science and countries do everything they can to harness global knowledge to national economic needs. However, accessing and using the riches of global knowledge can occur only through scientists. Consequently, the research power of nations relies on the research power of individual scientists. Their capacity to collaborate internationally and to tap into the global networked science is key. The constantly evolving, bottom-up, autonomous, self-regulating, and self-focused nature of global science requires deeper understanding; and the best way to understand its dynamics is to understand what drives academic scientists in their work. The idea that science remains a state-driven rather than curiosity-driven is difficult to sustain. In empirical terms, we describe the globalization of science using selected publication, collaboration, and citation data from 2000-2020. The globalization of science implies two different processes in two different system types: the growth of science in the Western world is almost entirely attributable to internationally co-authored publications; its growth in the developing world, in contrast, is driven by both internationally co-authored and domestic publications. Global network science opens incredible opportunities to new arrivals - countries as well as institutions and research teams. The global system is embedded in the rules created by scientists themselves and maintained as a self-organizing system and nation-states have another major level to consider in their science policies: the global level. Globalization of science provides more agency, autonomy, collegiality, and self-regulation to scientists embedded in national science structures and involved in global networks.",2023-12-09T12:12:51Z,2023-12-09T12:12:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03313v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03313v1,physics.soc-ph

"The Art and Practice of Data Science Pipelines: A Comprehensive Study of   Data Science Pipelines In Theory, In-The-Small, and In-The-Large","Sumon Biswas, Mohammad Wardat, Hridesh Rajan","Increasingly larger number of software systems today are including data science components for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The collection of data science stages from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to modeling, and so on are referred to as data science pipelines. To facilitate research and practice on data science pipelines, it is essential to understand their nature. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are they connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and that in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural characteristics of data science pipelines. In this work, we present a three-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-of-the-art, data science in-the-small, and data science in-the-large. Our study analyzes three datasets: a collection of 71 proposals for data science pipelines and related concepts in theory, a collection of over 105 implementations of curated data science pipelines from Kaggle competitions to understand data science in-the-small, and a collection of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub to understand data science in-the-large.

A comparative study on communication structures of Chinese journals in   the social sciences,"Ping Zhou, Xinning Su, Loet Leydesdorff","We argue that the communication structures in the Chinese social sciences have not yet been sufficiently reformed. Citation patterns among Chinese domestic journals in three subject areas -- political science and marxism, library and information science, and economics -- are compared with their counterparts internationally. Like their colleagues in the natural and life sciences, Chinese scholars in the social sciences provide fewer references to journal publications than their international counterparts; like their international colleagues, social scientists provide fewer references than natural sciences. The resulting citation networks, therefore, are sparse. Nevertheless, the citation structures clearly suggest that the Chinese social sciences are far less specialized in terms of disciplinary delineations than their international counterparts. Marxism studies are more established than political science in China. In terms of the impact of the Chinese political system on academic fields, disciplines closely related to the political system are less specialized than those weakly related. In the discussion section, we explore reasons that may cause the current stagnation and provide policy recommendations.",2010-02-18T18:24:06Z,2010-02-18T18:24:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3590v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3590v1,physics.soc-ph
Quantum information science as an approach to complex quantum systems,Michael A. Nielsen,"What makes quantum information science a science? These notes explore the idea that quantum information science may offer a powerful approach to the study of complex quantum systems.

Are Deterministic Descriptions And Indeterministic Descriptions   Observationally Equivalent?,Charlotte Werndl,"The central question of this paper is: are deterministic and indeterministic descriptions observationally equivalent in the sense that they give the same predictions? I tackle this question for measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes, both of which are ubiquitous in science. I first show that for many measure-theoretic deterministic systems there is a stochastic process which is observationally equivalent to the deterministic system. Conversely, I show that for all stochastic processes there is a measure-theoretic deterministic system which is observationally equivalent to the stochastic process. Still, one might guess that the measure-theoretic deterministic systems which are observationally equivalent to stochastic processes used in science do not include any deterministic systems used in science. I argue that this is not so because deterministic systems used in science even give rise to Bernoulli processes. Despite this, one might guess that measure-theoretic deterministic systems used in science cannot give the same predictions at every observation level as stochastic processes used in science. By proving results in ergodic theory, I show that also this guess is misguided: there are several deterministic systems used in science which give the same predictions at every observation level as Markov processes. All these results show that measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes are observationally equivalent more often than one might perhaps expect. Furthermore, I criticise the claims of the previous philosophy papers Suppes (1993, 1999), Suppes and de Barros (1996) and Winnie (1998) on observational equivalence.",2013-10-06T18:49:39Z,2013-10-06T18:49:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1615v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.1615v1,"math.DS, nlin.CD, physics.class-ph, physics.hist-ph"

Furthermore, it's so essential to have appropriate predictions to make better decisions in businesses, medical studies, and engineering studies, etc. One of the newest and most widely used of these methods is a field called Data Science that all of the scientists, engineers, and factories need to learn and use in their careers. This article briefly introduced data science and reviewed its methods, especially it's usages in mechanical engineering and challenges and ways of developing data science in mechanical engineering. In the introduction, different definitions of data science and its background in technology reviewed. In the following, data science methodology which is the process that a data scientist needs to do in its works been discussed.

Complexity Heliophysics: A lived and living history of systems and   complexity science in Heliophysics,Ryan M. McGranaghan,"This review examines complexity science in Heliophysics, describing it not as a discipline, but as a paradigm. In the context of Heliophysics, complexity science is the study of a star, interplanetary environment, magnetosphere, upper and terrestrial atmospheres, and planetary surface as interacting subsystems. Complexity science studies entities in a system (e.g., electrons in an atom, planets in a solar system, individuals in a society) and their interactions, and is the nature of what emerges from these interactions. It is a paradigm that employs systems approaches and is inherently multi- and cross-scale. Heliophysics processes span at least 15 orders of magnitude in space and another 15 in time, and its reaches go well beyond our own solar system and Earth's space environment to touch planetary, exoplanetary, and astrophysical domains. It is an uncommon domain within which to explore complexity science.   This review article excavates the lived and living history of complexity science in Heliophysics. It identifies five dimensions of complexity science. It then proceeds in three epochal parts: 1) A pivotal year in the Complexity Heliophysics paradigm: 1996; 2) The transitional years that established foundations of the paradigm (1996-2010); and 3) The emergent literature largely beyond 2010.   The history reveals a grand challenge that confronts most physical sciences to understand the research intersection between fundamental science (e.g., complexity science) and applied science (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). A risk science framework is suggested as a way of formulating the challenges in a way that the two converge.   The intention is to provide inspiration and guide future research. It will be instructive to Heliophysics researchers, but also to any reader interested in or hoping to advance the frontier of systems and complexity science.",2023-07-06T20:49:23Z,2024-04-04T14:43:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03287v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03287v3,"physics.space-ph, nlin.AO, physics.hist-ph"

Emergence of complex data from simple local rules in a network game,"Felipe S. Abrahão, Klaus Wehmuth, Artur Ziviani","As one of the main subjects of investigation in data science, network science has been demonstrated a wide range of applications to real-world networks analysis and modeling. For example, the pervasive presence of structural or topological characteristics, such as the small-world phenomenon, small-diameter, scale-free properties, or fat-tailed degree distribution were one of the underlying pillars fostering the study of complex networks. Relating these phenomena with other emergent properties in complex systems became a subject of central importance. By introducing new implications on the interface between data science and complex systems science with the purpose of tackling some of these issues, in this article we present a model for a network game played by complex networks in which nodes are computable systems. In particular, we present and discuss how some network topological properties and simple local communication rules are able to generate a phase transition with respect to the emergence of incompressible data.",2020-09-23T19:43:27Z,2020-09-23T19:43:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12210v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12210v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT, cs.MA, cs.SI, cs.SY, eess.SY, physics.soc-ph"
Beyond case studies: Teaching data science critique and ethics through   sociotechnical surveillance studies,"Nicholas Rabb, Desen Ozkan","Ethics have become an urgent concern for data science research, practice, and instruction in the wake of growing critique of algorithms and systems showing that they reinforce structural oppression. There has been increasing desire on the part of data science educators to craft curricula that speak to these critiques, yet much ethics education remains individualized, focused on specific cases, or too abstract and unapplicable. We synthesized some of the most popular critical data science works and designed a data science ethics course that spoke to the social phenomena at the root of critical data studies -- theories of oppression, social systems, power, history, and change -- through analysis of a pressing sociotechnical system: surveillance systems. Through analysis of student reflections and final projects, we determined that at the conclusion of the semester, all students had developed critical analysis skills that allowed them to investigate surveillance systems of their own and identify their benefits, harms, main proponents, those who resist them, and their interplay with social systems, all while considering dimensions of race, class, gender, and more. We argue that this type of instruction -- directly teaching data science ethics alongside social theory -- is a crucial next step for the field.",2023-05-03T20:24:42Z,2024-12-05T17:44:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02420v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02420v2,cs.CY
Data Quality Awareness: A Journey from Traditional Data Management to   Data Science Systems,"Sijie Dong, Soror Sahri, Themis Palpanas","Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various fields, significantly impacting our daily lives. A major factor in AI success is high-quality data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the evolution of data quality (DQ) awareness from traditional data management systems to modern data-driven AI systems, which are integral to data science. We synthesize the existing literature, highlighting the quality challenges and techniques that have evolved from traditional data management to data science including big data and ML fields. As data science systems support a wide range of activities, our focus in this paper lies specifically in the analytics aspect driven by machine learning. We use the cause-effect connection between the quality challenges of ML and those of big data to allow a more thorough understanding of emerging DQ challenges and the related quality awareness techniques in data science systems. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to provide a review of DQ awareness spanning traditional and emergent data science systems.

Challenges in Complex Systems Science,"Maxi San Miguel, Jeffrey H. Johnson, Janos Kertesz, Kimmo Kaski, Albert Díaz-Guilera, Robert S. MacKay, Vittorio Loreto, Peter Erdi, Dirk Helbing","FuturICT foundations are social science, complex systems science, and ICT. The main concerns and challenges in the science of complex systems in the context of FuturICT are laid out in this paper with special emphasis on the Complex Systems route to Social Sciences. This include complex systems having: many heterogeneous interacting parts; multiple scales; complicated transition laws; unexpected or unpredicted emergence; sensitive dependence on initial conditions; path-dependent dynamics; networked hierarchical connectivities; interaction of autonomous agents; self-organisation; non-equilibrium dynamics; combinatorial explosion; adaptivity to changing environments; co-evolving subsystems; ill-defined boundaries; and multilevel dynamics. In this context, science is seen as the process of abstracting the dynamics of systems from data. This presents many challenges including: data gathering by large-scale experiment, participatory sensing and social computation, managing huge distributed dynamic and heterogeneous databases; moving from data to dynamical models, going beyond correlations to cause-effect relationships, understanding the relationship between simple and comprehensive models with appropriate choices of variables, ensemble modeling and data assimilation, modeling systems of systems of systems with many levels between micro and macro; and formulating new approaches to prediction, forecasting, and risk, especially in systems that can reflect on and change their behaviour in response to predictions, and systems whose apparently predictable behaviour is disrupted by apparently unpredictable rare or extreme events.

Citizen Science: An Information Quality Research Frontier,"Roman Lukyanenko, Andrea Wiggins, Holly K. Rosser","The rapid proliferation of online content producing and sharing technologies resulted in an explosion of user-generated content (UGC), which now extends to scientific data. Citizen science, in which ordinary people contribute information for scientific research, epitomizes UGC. Citizen science projects are typically open to everyone, engage diverse audiences, and challenge ordinary people to produce data of highest quality to be usable in science. This also makes citizen science a very exciting area to study both traditional and innovative approaches to information quality management. With this paper we position citizen science as a leading information quality research frontier. We also show how citizen science opens a unique opportunity for the information systems community to contribute to a broad range of disciplines in natural and social sciences and humanities.",2019-05-20T18:39:57Z,2019-05-20T18:39:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08289v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08289v1,cs.CY

Drawing on research in CSCW, critical data studies, and history and sociology of science, and six months of immersive ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe four common tensions in applied data science work: (un)equivocal numbers, (counter)intuitive knowledge, (in)credible data, and (in)scrutable models. We show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and quantification, but also on negotiation and translation.

The 4+1 Model of Data Science,Rafael C. Alvarado,"Data Science is a complex and evolving field, but most agree that it can be defined as a combination of expertise drawn from three broad areascomputer science and technology, math and statistics, and domain knowledge -- with the purpose of extracting knowledge and value from data. Beyond this, the field is often defined as a series of practical activities ranging from the cleaning and wrangling of data, to its analysis and use to infer models, to the visual and rhetorical representation of results to stakeholders and decision-makers. This essay proposes a model of data science that goes beyond laundry-list definitions to get at the specific nature of data science and help distinguish it from adjacent fields such as computer science and statistics. We define data science as an interdisciplinary field comprising four broad areas of expertise: value, design, systems, and analytics. A fifth area, practice, integrates the other four in specific contexts of domain knowledge. We call this the 4+1 model of data science. Together, these areas belong to every data science project, even if they are often unconnected and siloed in the academy.",2023-11-13T12:12:32Z,2023-11-13T12:12:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07631v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07631v1,"cs.DB, cs.GL, E.m; K.2"
Construction of a Pragmatic Base Line for Journal Classifications and   Maps Based on Aggregated Journal-Journal Citation Relations,"Loet Leydesdorff, Lutz Bornmann, Ping Zhou","A number of journal classification systems have been developed in bibliometrics since the launch of the Citation Indices by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) in the 1960s. These systems are used to normalize citation counts with respect to field-specific citation patterns. The best known system is the so-called ""Web-of-Science Subject Categories"" (WCs). In other systems papers are classified by algorithmic solutions. Using the Journal Citation Reports 2014 of the Science Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index (n of journals = 11,149), we examine options for developing a new system based on journal classifications into subject categories using aggregated journal-journal citation data. Combining routines in VOSviewer and Pajek, a tree-like classification is developed. At each level one can generate a map of science for all the journals subsumed under a category. Nine major fields are distinguished at the top level. Further decomposition of the social sciences is pursued for the sake of example with a focus on journals in information science (LIS) and science studies (STS). The new classification system improves on alternative options by avoiding the problem of randomness in each run that has made algorithmic solutions hitherto irreproducible. Limitations of the new system are discussed (e.g. the classification of multi-disciplinary journals). The system's usefulness for field-normalization in bibliometrics should be explored in future studies.",2016-04-10T17:40:20Z,2016-07-21T06:21:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02716v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02716v4,cs.DL

MatInf -- an Extensible Open-Source Solution for Research Digitalisation   in Materials Science,"Victor Dudarev, Lars Banko, Alfred Ludwig","Information technology and data science development stimulate transformation in many fields of scientific knowledge. In recent years, a large number of specialized systems for information and knowledge management have been created in materials science. However, the development and deployment of open adaptive systems for research support in materials science based on the acquisition, storage, and processing of different types of information remains unsolved. We propose MatInf - an extensible, open-source solution for research digitalisation in materials science based on an adaptive, flexible information management system for heterogeneous data sources.

How do scientific disciplines evolve in applied sciences? The properties   of scientific fission and ambidextrous scientific drivers,Mario Coccia,"One of the fundamental questions in science is how scientific disciplines evolve and sustain progress in society. No studies to date allows us to explain the endogenous processes that support the evolution of scientific disciplines and emergence of new scientific fields in applied sciences of physics. This study confronts this problem here by investigating the evolution of experimental physics to explain and generalize some characteristics of the dynamics of applied sciences. Empirical analysis suggests properties about the evolution of experimental physics and in general of applied sciences, such as: a) scientific fission, the evolution of scientific disciplines generates a process of division into two or more research fields that evolve as autonomous entities over time; b) ambidextrous drivers of science, the evolution of science via scientific fission is due to scientific discoveries or new technologies; c) new driving research fields, the drivers of scientific disciplines are new research fields rather than old ones; d) science driven by development of general purpose technologies, the evolution of experimental physics and applied sciences is due to the convergence of experimental and theoretical branches of physics associated with the development of computer, information systems and applied computational science. Results also reveal that average duration of the upwave of scientific production in scientific fields supporting experimental physics is about 80 years. Overall, then, this study begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, some characteristics of the evolutionary dynamics of scientific disciplines that can lay a foundation for the development of comprehensive properties explaining the evolution of science as a whole for supporting fruitful research policy implications directed to advancement of science and technological progress in society.",2019-11-13T09:25:59Z,2019-11-13T09:25:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05363v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05363v1,"econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
A multi-level model for self-adaptive systems,"Emanuela Merelli, Nicola Paoletti, Luca Tesei","This work introduces a general multi-level model for self-adaptive systems. A self-adaptive system is seen as composed by two levels: the lower level describing the actual behaviour of the system and the upper level accounting for the dynamically changing environmental constraints on the system. In order to keep our description as general as possible, the lower level is modelled as a state machine and the upper level as a second-order state machine whose states have associated formulas over observable variables of the lower level. Thus, each state of the second-order machine identifies the set of lower-level states satisfying the constraints. Adaptation is triggered when a second-order transition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can satisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its behaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints. The semantics of the multi-level system is given by a flattened transition system that can be statically checked in order to prove the correctness of the adaptation model. To this aim we formalize two concepts of weak and strong adaptability providing both a relational and a logical characterization. We report that this work gives a formal computational characterization of multi-level self-adaptive systems, evidencing the important role that (theoretical) computer science could play in the emerging science of complex systems.",2012-09-07T01:41:52Z,2013-05-14T21:29:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1628v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.1628v2,"cs.LO, cs.SE, F.1.1; D.2; F.3.1"

The Sources of Certainty in Computation and Formal Systems,Michael J. O'Donnell,"In his Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences, Rene Descartes sought ``clear and certain knowledge of all that is useful in life.'' Almost three centuries later, in ``The foundations of mathematics,'' David Hilbert tried to ``recast mathematical definitions and inferences in such a way that they are unshakable.'' Hilbert's program relied explicitly on formal systems (equivalently, computational systems) to provide certainty in mathematics. The concepts of computation and formal system were not defined in his time, but Descartes' method may be understood as seeking certainty in essentially the same way.   In this article, I explain formal systems as concrete artifacts, and investigate the way in which they provide a high level of certainty---arguably the highest level achievable by rational discourse. The rich understanding of formal systems achieved by mathematical logic and computer science in this century illuminates the nature of programs, such as Descartes' and Hilbert's, that seek certainty through rigorous analysis.",1999-11-17T17:18:42Z,1999-11-17T17:18:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9911010v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9911010v1,"cs.OH, F.4.0"
Large-Scale Analysis of the Accuracy of the Journal Classification   Systems of Web of Science and Scopus,"Qi Wang, Ludo Waltman","Journal classification systems play an important role in bibliometric analyses. The two most important bibliographic databases, Web of Science and Scopus, each provide a journal classification system. However, no study has systematically investigated the accuracy of these classification systems. To examine and compare the accuracy of journal classification systems, we define two criteria on the basis of direct citation relations between journals and categories. We use Criterion I to select journals that have weak connections with their assigned categories, and we use Criterion II to identify journals that are not assigned to categories with which they have strong connections. If a journal satisfies either of the two criteria, we conclude that its assignment to categories may be questionable. Accordingly, we identify all journals with questionable classifications in Web of Science and Scopus. Furthermore, we perform a more in-depth analysis for the field of Library and Information Science to assess whether our proposed criteria are appropriate and whether they yield meaningful results. It turns out that according to our citation-based criteria Web of Science performs significantly better than Scopus in terms of the accuracy of its journal classification system.",2015-11-02T22:55:50Z,2016-01-24T09:47:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00735v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00735v2,cs.DL

Growth rates of modern science: A latent piecewise growth curve approach   to model publication numbers from established and new literature databases,"Lutz Bornmann, Robin Haunschild, Ruediger Mutz","Growth of science is a prevalent issue in science of science studies. In recent years, two new bibliographic databases have been introduced which can be used to study growth processes in science from centuries back: Dimensions from Digital Science and Microsoft Academic. In this study, we used publication data from these new databases and added publication data from two established databases (Web of Science from Clarivate Analytics and Scopus from Elsevier) to investigate scientific growth processes from the beginning of the modern science system until today. We estimated regression models that included simultaneously the publication counts from the four databases. The results of the unrestricted growth of science calculations show that the overall growth rate amounts to 4.10% with a doubling time of 17.3 years. As the comparison of various segmented regression models in the current study revealed, the model with five segments fits the publication data best. We demonstrated that these segments with different growth rates can be interpreted very well, since they are related to either phases of economic (e.g., industrialization) and / or political developments (e.g., Second World War). In this study, we additionally analyzed scientific growth in two broad fields (Physical and Technical Sciences as well as Life Sciences) and the relationship of scientific and economic growth in UK.

Multilevel modeling thus was employed to conduct the analysis dealing with this nature. The first level analysis involved students' performance and affective attribute measured using demonstrated science literacy assessment (SLA-D) and motivational beliefs (SLA-MB) respectively. The subsequent level analysis comprised demographic factors gathered from institutional record. Findings demonstrated that the impact of demographic factor to the students' performance on science literacy was not substantial. Different setting of students' department and faculty level drove the association between affective factor and learning process toward science literacy course substantially. Multilevel approach has controlled the equitable student assessment within the nature of students' data structure. This paper suggests many implications to open ideas regarding educational data analysis and to examine the effectiveness of science literacy course for the higher institution specifically for non-science majors.,2023-04-13T19:06:24Z,2023-04-13T19:06:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06782v1,"physics.ed-ph, physics.soc-ph"
How Informal Science Education Influences Elementary Students'   Perceptions of Science and Themselves,"Molly K Finn, Renato Mazzei, Blake Drechsler, Zoie Telkamp, Mihika Rao, Prakamya Agrawal, Anne McAlister","Underrepresentation in STEM fields starts early, with elementary students already showing differences based on gender and race in their interest in science, belief in their ability to do science, and belief that their personal identity aligns with being a scientist. Here we discuss an out-of-school time astronomy program that focuses on enriching science education in under-served school systems to promote students' excitement about science and help them see scientists as people just like them. Before, after, and throughout the program, we survey students on their perceptions of science, themselves, and their activities. We find that over the course of our program, students become more confident in their science abilities. Student ideas about science remain unchanged, but largely align with Nature of Science ideals. We also find that on days that students report they were creative and asked questions, they were more likely to say they felt like a scientist and were interested in the day's topic. Our results suggest that incorporating creativity and opportunities to ask questions can be just as important as doing experiments for generating interest in and a sense of participating in science.",2023-06-09T16:30:36Z,2023-06-09T16:30:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06014v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06014v1,physics.ed-ph

Nonlinear systems for unconventional computing,"Kirill P. Kalinin, Natalia G. Berloff","The search for new computational machines beyond the traditional von Neumann architecture has given rise to a modern area of nonlinear science -- development of unconventional computing -- requiring the efforts of mathematicians, physicists and engineers. Many analogue physical systems including nonlinear oscillator networks, lasers, and condensates were proposed and realised to address hard computational problems from various areas of social and physical sciences and technology. The analogue systems emulate spin Hamiltonians with continuous or discrete degrees of freedom to which actual optimisation problems can be mapped. Understanding the underlying physical process by which the system finds the ground state often leads to new classes of system-inspired or quantum-inspired algorithms for hard optimisation. Together physical platforms and related algorithms can be combined to form a hybrid architecture that may one day compete with conventional computing. In this Chapter, we review some of the systems and physically-inspired algorithms that show such promise.",2019-12-26T09:47:23Z,2019-12-26T09:47:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11819v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11819v1,"cs.ET, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.soft, cs.CC, nlin.AO"
Formalizing Memory Accesses and Interrupts,"Reto Achermann, Lukas Humbel, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe","The hardware/software boundary in modern heterogeneous multicore computers is increasingly complex, and diverse across different platforms. A single memory access by a core or DMA engine traverses multiple hardware translation and caching steps, and the destination memory cell or register often appears at different physical addresses for different cores. Interrupts pass through a complex topology of interrupt controllers and remappers before delivery to one or more cores, each with specific constraints on their configurations. System software must not only correctly understand the specific hardware at hand, but also configure it appropriately at runtime. We propose a formal model of address spaces and resources in a system that allows us to express and verify invariants of the system's runtime configuration, and illustrate (and motivate) it with several real platforms we have encountered in the process of OS implementation.",2017-03-20T02:47:57Z,2017-03-20T02:47:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06571v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06571v1,"cs.OS, cs.AR, D.4; D.4.2; D.4.7; D.3.4"

We present a tabulation of refereed science papers from LGS AO, amounting to a total of 23 publications as of May 2006. The first decade of LGS AO science (1995-2004) was marked by modest science productivity (~1 paper/year), as LGS systems were being implemented and commissioned. The last two years have seen explosive science growth (~1 paper/month), largely due to the new LGS system on the Keck II 10-meter telescope, and point to an exciting new era for high angular resolution science. To illustrate the achievable on-sky performance, we present an extensive collection of Keck LGS performance measurements from the first year of our brown dwarf near-IR imaging survey.

Global health science leverages established collaboration network to   fight COVID-19,"Stefano Bianchini, Moritz Müller, Pierre Pelletier, Kevin Wirtz","How has the science system reacted to the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic? Here we compare the (growing) international network for coronavirus research with the broader international health science network. Our findings show that, before the outbreak, coronavirus research realized a relatively small and rather peculiar niche within the global health sciences. As a response to the pandemic, the international network for coronavirus research expanded rapidly along the hierarchical structure laid out by the global health science network. Thus, in face of the crisis, the global health science system proved to be structurally stable yet versatile in research. The observed versatility supports optimistic views on the role of science in meeting future challenges. However, the stability of the global core-periphery structure may be worrying, because it reduces learning opportunities and social capital of scientifically peripheral countries -- not only during this pandemic but also in its ""normal"" mode of operation.",2021-01-30T19:39:35Z,2021-01-30T19:39:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00298v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00298v1,"econ.GN, q-fin.EC"

Friend or Foe? Exploring the Implications of Large Language Models on   the Science System,"Benedikt Fecher, Marcel Hebing, Melissa Laufer, Jörg Pohle, Fabian Sofsky","The advent of ChatGPT by OpenAI has prompted extensive discourse on its potential implications for science and higher education. While the impact on education has been a primary focus, there is limited empirical research on the effects of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based chatbots on science and scientific practice. To investigate this further, we conducted a Delphi study involving 72 experts specialising in research and AI. The study focused on applications and limitations of LLMs, their effects on the science system, ethical and legal considerations, and the required competencies for their effective use. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in science, particularly in administrative, creative, and analytical tasks. However, risks related to bias, misinformation, and quality assurance need to be addressed through proactive regulation and science education.

Science 3.0: Corrections to the Science 2.0 paradigm,Vladimir B. Teif,"The concept of Science 2.0 was introduced almost a decade ago to describe the new generation of online-based tools for researchers allowing easier data sharing, collaboration and publishing. Although technically sound, the concept still does not work as expected. Here we provide a systematic line of arguments to modify the concept of Science 2.0, making it more consistent with the spirit and traditions of science and Internet. Our first correction to the Science 2.0 paradigm concerns the open-access publication models charging fees to the authors. As discussed elsewhere, we show that the monopoly of such publishing models increases biases and inequalities in the representation of scientific ideas based on the author's income. Our second correction concerns post-publication comments online, which are all essentially non-anonymous in the current Science 2.0 paradigm. We conclude that scientific post-publication discussions require special anonymization systems. We further analyze the reasons of the failure of the current post-publication peer-review models and suggest what needs to be changed in Science 3.0 to convert Internet into a large journal club.",2013-01-11T15:40:35Z,2013-01-19T17:02:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2522v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2522v2,"cs.DL, cs.CY"

Science of Cyber Security as a System of Models and Problems,Alexander Kott,"Terms like ""Science of Cyber"" or ""Cyber Science"" have been appearing in literature with growing frequency, and influential organizations initiated research initiatives toward developing such a science even though it is not clearly defined. We propose to define the domain of the science of cyber security by noting the most salient artifact within cyber security -- malicious software -- and defining the domain as comprised of phenomena that involve malicious software (as well as legitimate software and protocols used maliciously) used to compel a computing device or a network of computing devices to perform actions desired by the perpetrator of malicious software (the attacker) and generally contrary to the intent (the policy) of the legitimate owner or operator (the defender) of the computing device(s). We further define the science of cyber security as the study of relations -- preferably expressed as theoretically-grounded models -- between attributes, structures and dynamics of: violations of cyber security policy; the network of computing devices under attack; the defenders' tools and techniques; and the attackers' tools and techniques where malicious software plays the central role.

Multiscale Bone Remodelling with Spatial P Systems,"Diletta Cacciagrano, Flavio Corradini, Emanuela Merelli, Luca Tesei","Many biological phenomena are inherently multiscale, i.e. they are characterized by interactions involving different spatial and temporal scales simultaneously. Though several approaches have been proposed to provide ""multilayer"" models, only Complex Automata, derived from Cellular Automata, naturally embed spatial information and realize multiscaling with well-established inter-scale integration schemas. Spatial P systems, a variant of P systems in which a more geometric concept of space has been added, have several characteristics in common with Cellular Automata. We propose such a formalism as a basis to rephrase the Complex Automata multiscaling approach and, in this perspective, provide a 2-scale Spatial P system describing bone remodelling.

The science of complexity may provide the platform to cross disciplinary boundaries in seemingly disparate fields such as brain science and economics. In this paper we take an integrative stance, fostering new insights into the economic character of neural activity.

They pose problems of organized complexity which cannot be approached with a reductionist method. Complexity science and its emergent sister network science both come to grips with the inherent complexity of complex systems with an holistic strategy. The relevance of complexity, however, transcends the sciences. Complex systems and networks are the focal point of a philosophical, cultural and artistic turn of our tightly interrelated and interdependent postmodern society. Here I take a different, aesthetic perspective on complexity. I argue that complex systems can be beautiful and can the object of artification - the neologism refers to processes in which something that is not regarded as art in the traditional sense of the word is changed into art. Complex systems and networks are powerful sources of inspiration for the generative designer, for the artful data visualizer, as well as for the traditional artist.

Simulator Semantics for System Level Formal Verification,"Toni Mancini, Federico Mari, Annalisa Massini, Igor Melatti, Enrico Tronci","Many simulation based Bounded Model Checking approaches to System Level Formal Verification (SLFV) have been devised. Typically such approaches exploit the capability of simulators to save computation time by saving and restoring the state of the system under simulation. However, even though such approaches aim to (bounded) formal verification, as a matter of fact, the simulator behaviour is not formally modelled and the proof of correctness of the proposed approaches basically relies on the intuitive notion of simulator behaviour. This gap makes it hard to check if the optimisations introduced to speed up the simulation do not actually omit checking relevant behaviours of the system under verification.   The aim of this paper is to fill the above gap by presenting a formal semantics for simulators.",2015-09-24T01:52:55Z,2015-09-24T01:52:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07201v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07201v1,"cs.SE, cs.SY"

Our system takes the middle path between the classical graphics pipeline and the recent deep learning approaches that generate images of humans using image-to-image translation. In particular, our system estimates an explicit two-dimensional texture map of the model surface. At the same time, it abstains from explicit shape modeling in 3D. Instead, at test time, the system uses a fully-convolutional network to directly map the configuration of body feature points w.r.t. the camera to the 2D texture coordinates of individual pixels in the image frame. We show that such a system is capable of learning to generate realistic renderings while being trained on videos annotated with 3D poses and foreground masks. We also demonstrate that maintaining an explicit texture representation helps our system to achieve better generalization compared to systems that use direct image-to-image translation.",2019-05-21T17:46:16Z,2019-05-21T17:46:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08776v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08776v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG"
HoneyComb: A Flexible LLM-Based Agent System for Materials Science,"Huan Zhang, Yu Song, Ziyu Hou, Santiago Miret, Bang Liu","The emergence of specialized large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in addressing complex tasks for materials science. Many LLMs, however, often struggle with distinct complexities of material science tasks, such as materials science computational tasks, and often rely heavily on outdated implicit knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce HoneyComb, the first LLM-based agent system specifically designed for materials science. HoneyComb leverages a novel, high-quality materials science knowledge base (MatSciKB) and a sophisticated tool hub (ToolHub) to enhance its reasoning and computational capabilities tailored to materials science. MatSciKB is a curated, structured knowledge collection based on reliable literature, while ToolHub employs an Inductive Tool Construction method to generate, decompose, and refine API tools for materials science. Additionally, HoneyComb leverages a retriever module that adaptively selects the appropriate knowledge source or tools for specific tasks, thereby ensuring accuracy and relevance. Our results demonstrate that HoneyComb significantly outperforms baseline models across various tasks in materials science, effectively bridging the gap between current LLM capabilities and the specialized needs of this domain. Furthermore, our adaptable framework can be easily extended to other scientific domains, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in advancing scientific research and applications.",2024-08-29T15:38:40Z,2024-08-29T15:38:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00135v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00135v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

A logical set theory approach to journal subject classification   analysis: intra-system irregularities and inter-system discrepancies in Web   of Science and Scopus,"Shir Aviv-Reuven, Ariel Rosenfeld","Journal classification into subject categories is an important aspect in scholarly research evaluation as well as in bibliometric analysis. However, this classification is not standardized, resulting in several different journal subject classification systems. In this study, we adopt a logical set theory-based definition of irregularities within a given classification system and discrepancies between systems and investigate their prevalence in the two most widely used indexing services of Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. In both systems, we identify unusually sized categories, high overlap and incohesiveness between categories. In addition, across the two systems, journals are systematically classified to a different number of categories and most categories in either system are not adequately represented in the other system. Our findings suggest that these irregularities and discrepancies are, in fact, non-anecdotal and thus cannot be easily disregarded. Consequently, potentially misguided and/or inconsistent outcomes may be encountered when relying on these subject classification systems.",2021-07-26T14:02:21Z,2022-09-04T07:26:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12222v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12222v2,"cs.DL, stat.AP"
"Impact of Exoplanet Science on Society: Professional Contributions,   Citizen Science Engagement and Public Perception",H. J. Deeg,"The impact of exoplanet science on both the scientific community and on the general public is presented through various indicators and examples. It is estimated that about 3-4% of all refereed astronomy articles focus on exoplanets, and between 15-20% percent of current, and up to 25% of upcoming astronomy space missions are dedicated to exoplanet research. Also, about 15-20% of the science cases for large multi-purpose ground-based astronomical instruments involve exoplanet science.   Interactions between the scientific community and the public occur on several levels and play a crucial role in shaping the future of exoplanet science. The rise of citizen science platforms and the successes of coordinated observing projects involving amateur astronomers have engaged the public in meaningful scientific contributions, and contribute to some areas of discovery and characterization of exoplanet systems, for which several examples are given. These initiatives not only fuel public interest in the search for extraterrestrial life but also promote STEM education, broadening participation in science.   Lastly, the changing perception of the informed public about the existence of ""other Earths"" and life in the Universe in the light of results from exoplanet science is outlined. Media coverage of results from exoplanet science has furthered the acceptance that extraterrestrial life, be it intelligent of not, is not rare in the Universe. The shift in perception that such life might be detected in a potentially not very distant future has, in turn, promoted public support for the research infrastructure necessary to sustain the growth of exoplanetology.",2024-10-09T12:24:36Z,2024-10-09T12:24:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07285v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07285v1,"astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, physics.soc-ph"
On Term Rewriting Systems Having a Rational Derivation,Antoine Meyer,"Several types of term rewriting systems can be distinguished by the way their rules overlap. In particular, we define the classes of prefix, suffix, bottom-up and top-down systems, which generalize similar classes on words. Our aim is to study the derivation relation of such systems (i.e. the reflexive and transitive closure of their rewriting relation) and, if possible, to provide a finite mechanism characterizing it. Using a notion of rational relations based on finite graph grammars, we show that the derivation of any bottom-up, top-down or suffix systems is rational, while it can be non recursive for prefix systems.",2007-05-28T16:30:27Z,2007-05-28T16:30:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4064v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.4064v1,cs.LO

It will be used an example of an asynchronous sequential system that will set up an output signal when an input signal will be set up. The width of the output signal depends on the input signal width, and in this case it is very short. There are many synthesis methods, like using a RC group system, a monostable system in design of the asynchronous digital system or using an external clock signal, CK. In this paper will be used a monostable circuit.",2009-04-23T14:50:31Z,2009-04-23T14:50:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3714v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.3714v1,cs.OH

Toward an Algebraic Theory of Systems,"Christian Matt, Ueli Maurer, Christopher Portmann, Renato Renner, Björn Tackmann","We propose the concept of a system algebra with a parallel composition operation and an interface connection operation, and formalize composition-order invariance, which postulates that the order of composing and connecting systems is irrelevant, a generalized form of associativity. Composition-order invariance explicitly captures a common property that is implicit in any context where one can draw a figure (hiding the drawing order) of several connected systems, which appears in many scientific contexts. This abstract algebra captures settings where one is interested in the behavior of a composed system in an environment and wants to abstract away anything internal not relevant for the behavior. This may include physical systems, electronic circuits, or interacting distributed systems.   One specific such setting, of special interest in computer science, are functional system algebras, which capture, in the most general sense, any type of system that takes inputs and produces outputs depending on the inputs, and where the output of a system can be the input to another system. The behavior of such a system is uniquely determined by the function mapping inputs to outputs. We consider several instantiations of this very general concept. In particular, we show that Kahn networks form a functional system algebra and prove their composition-order invariance.   Moreover, we define a functional system algebra of causal systems, characterized by the property that inputs can only influence future outputs, where an abstract partial order relation captures the notion of ""later"". This system algebra is also shown to be composition-order invariant and appropriate instantiations thereof allow to model and analyze systems that depend on time.",2016-09-13T19:43:37Z,2018-09-22T05:46:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04293v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04293v2,cs.OH

Unravelling Single Atom Catalysis: The Surface Science Approach,Gareth S. Parkinson,"Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of single-atom catalysis (SAC) is important to design systems with improved performance and stability. This is problematic, however, because single-atom active sites are extremely difficult to characterize with existing experimental techniques. Over the last 40 years, surface science has provided the fundamental insights to understand heterogeneous catalysis, but model systems in which metal atoms are stable on well-characterized metal-oxide substrates at reaction temperatures are scarce. In this perspective, I discuss what is already known about isolated metal atoms adsorbed on model metal-oxide surfaces, and how this information can be used to understand SAC. A key issue is that, although the highly-idealised model systems studied in surface science may not be representative of a real working catalyst, they do very much resemble what can be calculated using state-of-the-art theoretical modelling. Thus, surface science offers an opportunity to rigorously benchmark the theoretical approach to modelling SAC in future. Perhaps more excitingly, several groups have developed model systems where metal adatoms remain stable at elevated temperatures. To date however, there has been no clear demonstration of catalytic activity. The perspective closes with a brief discussion of the prospect for STM experiments under realistic reaction conditions.",2017-06-28T20:23:04Z,2017-06-28T20:23:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09473v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09473v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

To capture important properties of increasingly complex energy systems, sophisticated and flexible modelling tools are needed. At the same time, open science is becoming increasingly important in energy system modelling. This paper presents the Open Energy Modelling Framework (oemof) as a novel approach to energy system modelling, representation and analysis. The framework provides a toolbox to construct comprehensive energy system models and has been published open source under a free licence. Through collaborative development based on open processes, the framework supports a maximum level of participation, transparency and open science principles in energy system modelling. Based on a generic graph-based description of energy systems, it is well-suited to flexibly model complex cross-sectoral systems and incorporate various modelling approaches. This makes the framework a multi-purpose modelling environment for modelling and analyzing different systems at scales ranging from urban to transnational.",2018-08-24T10:06:44Z,2018-08-24T10:06:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08070v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08070v1,cs.CE
Approach to Data Science with Multiscale Information Theory,"Shahid Nawaz, Muhammad Saleem, F. V. Kusmartsev, Dalaver H. Anjum","Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that plays a crucial role in extracting valuable insights and knowledge from large and intricate datasets. Within the realm of Data Science, two fundamental components are Information Theory (IT) and Statistical Mechanics (SM), which provide a theoretical framework for understanding dataset properties. IT enables efficient storage and transmission of information, while SM focuses on the behavior of systems comprising numerous interacting components. In the context of data science, SM allows us to model complex interactions among variables within a dataset. By leveraging these tools, data scientists can gain a profound understanding of data properties, leading to the development of advanced models and algorithms for analysis and interpretation. Consequently, data science has the potential to drive accurate predictions and enhance decision-making across various domains, including finance, marketing, healthcare, and scientific research.   In this paper, we apply this data science framework to a large and intricate quantum mechanical system composed of particles. Our research demonstrates that the dynamic and probabilistic nature of such systems can be effectively addressed using a Multiscale Entropic Dynamics (MED) approach, derived from the Boltzmann methods of SM. Through the MED approach, we can describe the system's dynamics by formulating a general form of the Nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation and how it can be applied to various systems with particles and quasi-particles, such as electrons, plasmons, polarons, and solitons. By employing this innovative approach, we pave the way for a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical systems and their behaviors within complex materials.",2023-05-23T01:08:50Z,2023-05-23T01:08:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13576v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13576v1,"physics.data-an, quant-ph"
Nanometric Scale Surface science and the Markov chain Monte Carlo   simulation of disordered systems,Oluwole Emmanuel Oyewande,"The Markov chain Monte Carlo method as a statistical mechanics technique for the study of macroscopic systems has furnished the scientific community with great knowledge and advances in the theory of phase transitions. While a number of Monte Carlo models have been proposed for the study of surface growth, these models have not nearly being studied as exhaustively as in the models of magnetic systems, a paradigm of which is the classical model of Ernest Ising. In particular, studies of phase transitions in surface/interface science at nanometric scales are almost non-existent. This article has been written to motivate research in this area of statistical mechanics from the perspective of surface science. In this article we survey the rudiments of the method along with some models of disordered systems such as magnetic systems, material fracture, nano-pattern formation under ion bombardment, and molecular chirality. We performed simulations of these models using the method and obtained results that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations.",2012-07-03T16:42:47Z,2013-10-09T11:29:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0744v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0744v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
InnovationInsights: A Visual Analytics Approach for Understanding the   Dual Frontiers of Science and Technology,"Yifang Wang, Yifan Qian, Xiaoyu Qi, Nan Cao, Dashun Wang","Science has long been viewed as a key driver of economic growth and rising standards of living. Knowledge about how scientific advances support marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. However, we lack suitable visual analytics approaches to analyze such complex interactions effectively. Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of the Science of Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. This visualization thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation.",2023-08-05T18:23:06Z,2023-08-08T18:00:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02933v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02933v2,"cs.HC, cs.SI"
The Import and Export of Cognitive Science,"Rob Goldstone, Loet Leydesdorff","From its inception, a large part of the motivation for Cognitive Science has been the need for an interdisciplinary journal for the study of minds and intelligent systems. One threat to the interdisciplinarity of Cognitive Science, both the field and journal, is that it may become, or already be, too dominated by psychologists. In 2005, psychology was a keyword for 51% of submissions, followed distantly by linguistics (17%), artificial intelligence (13%), neuroscience (10%), computer science (9%), and philosophy (8%). The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) gathers data not only on how individual articles cite one another, but also on macroscopic citation patterns among journals. Journals or sets of journals can be considered as proxies for fields. As fields become established, they often create journals. By studying the patterns of citations among journals that cite and are cited by Cognitive Science, we can better: 1) appreciate the scholarly ecology surrounding the journal and the journals role within this ecology, 2) establish competitor and alternate journals, and 3) determine the natural clustering of fields related to cognitive science.",2009-11-18T20:00:02Z,2009-11-18T20:00:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3641v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3641v1,"cs.DL, physics.soc-ph"
Science Models as Value-Added Services for Scholarly Information Systems,"Peter Mutschke, Philipp Mayr, Philipp Schaer, York Sure","The paper introduces scholarly Information Retrieval (IR) as a further dimension that should be considered in the science modeling debate. The IR use case is seen as a validation model of the adequacy of science models in representing and predicting structure and dynamics in science. Particular conceptualizations of scholarly activity and structures in science are used as value-added search services to improve retrieval quality: a co-word model depicting the cognitive structure of a field (used for query expansion), the Bradford law of information concentration, and a model of co-authorship networks (both used for re-ranking search results). An evaluation of the retrieval quality when science model driven services are used turned out that the models proposed actually provide beneficial effects to retrieval quality. From an IR perspective, the models studied are therefore verified as expressive conceptualizations of central phenomena in science. Thus, it could be shown that the IR perspective can significantly contribute to a better understanding of scholarly structures and activities.",2011-05-12T12:07:42Z,2011-05-12T12:07:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2441v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.2441v1,"cs.DL, cs.IR, H.3.3"
The Chemistry Between High School Students and Computer Science,"Timothy T. Lenczycki, Kelly Suto, Christina Williams, Michelle Mills Strout","Computer science enrollments have started to rise again, but the percentage of women undergraduates in computer science is still low. Some studies indicate this might be due to a lack of awareness of computer science at the high school level. We present our experiences running a 5-year, high school outreach program that introduces information about computer science within the context of required chemistry courses. We developed interactive worksheets using Molecular Workbench that help the students learn chemistry and computer science concepts related to relevant events such as the gulf oil spill. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach indicates that the students do become more aware of computer science as a discipline, but system support issues in the classroom can make the approach difficult for teachers and discouraging for the students.",2014-06-09T15:44:41Z,2014-06-09T15:44:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2222v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2222v1,"cs.CY, K.3.2"
Science and its significant other: Representing the humanities in   bibliometric scholarship,"Thomas Franssen, Paul Wouters","Bibliometrics offers a particular representation of science. Through bibliometric methods a bibliometrician will always highlight particular elements of publications, and through these elements operationalize particular representations of science, while obscuring other possible representations from view. Understanding bibliometrics as representation implies that a bibliometric analysis is always performative: a bibliometric analysis brings a particular representation of science into being that potentially influences the science system itself. In this review we analyze the ways the humanities have been represented throughout the history of bibliometrics, often in comparison to other scientific domains or to a general notion of the sciences. Our review discusses bibliometric scholarship between 1965 and 2016 that studies the humanities empirically. We distinguish between two periods of bibliometric scholarship. The first period, between 1965 and 1989, is characterized by a sociological theoretical framework, the development and use of the Price index, and small samples of journal publications as data sources. The second period, from the mid-1980s up until the present day, is characterized by a new hinterland, that of science policy and research evaluation, in which bibliometric methods become embedded.",2017-10-11T11:13:58Z,2017-10-11T11:13:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04004v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04004v1,cs.DL
Knowledge discovery via multidimensional science maps: the case of the   Species Problem,Sandor Soos,"Science mapping (SM), the study of the organization and development of science and technology, is a rapidly developing field within information science. The volume of available data allows this methodology to empirically address such issues as the historical development of topics, discourses, fields or the entire science system. Based on the pool of related methods, we are proposing an integration of various maps to obtain a novel kind of science map we call multidimensional. The basic idea behind is to combine the most informative relations available from various maps based on different bibliometric indicators, in order to produce a rich structrue for the study of knowledge dynamics, with special emphasis on causal-historical connections. As a proof of concept, we deploy the proposed framework in an extensive case study on a historical topic from the life sciences, namely, the debate on the species concept in biosystematics.",2014-09-24T14:05:26Z,2014-09-24T14:05:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6964v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6964v1,cs.DL
The Social Abduction of Science,"Eamon Duede, James Evans","The logic of abduction involves a collision between deduction and induction, where empirical surprises violate expectations and scientists innovate to resolve them. Here we reformulate abduction as a social process, occurring not only within individual scientists, but often through conversation between those who understand a particular scientific system and its anomalies (its insiders) and those exposed to alien and disruptive patterns, theories, and findings that could resolve them (its outsiders). These extended conversations between scientists, scholars, and disciplines with divergent backgrounds define a social logic of discovery by catalyzing social syllogisms that yield speculative hypotheses with outsized impact across science. We show how this approach theorizes a number of disparate findings from scientometrics and the science and science, tethering them to powerful interpersonal processes that link diversity with discovery. By reframing abductive reasoning as a social process, we attempt to broker a productive new relationship between science studies' focus on scientific practice and the philosophy of science's concern with propositions in scientific discourse, rendering claims-making through abduction a critical scientific practice, central to scientific change, and increasingly available to science studies through small and large-scale data on scientific communication and deliberation.",2021-11-25T20:57:51Z,2021-11-25T20:57:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13251v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13251v1,physics.soc-ph
Complexity through Translations for Modal Logic with Recursion,"Luca Aceto, Antonis Achilleos, Elli Anastasiadi, Adrian Francalanza, Anna Ingolfsdottir","This paper studies the complexity of classical modal logics and of their extension with fixed-point operators, using translations to transfer results across logics. In particular, we show several complexity results for multi-agent logics via translations to and from the mu-calculus and modal logic, which allow us to transfer known upper and lower bounds. We also use these translations to introduce a terminating tableau system for the logics we study, based on Kozen's tableau for the mu-calculus, and the one of Fitting and Massacci for modal logic.",2022-09-21T14:14:46Z,2022-09-21T14:14:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10377v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10377v1,"cs.LO, F.4.1; I.2.4"
Quantum Cybernetics and Complex Quantum Systems Science - A Quantum   Connectionist Exploration,Carlos Pedro Gonçalves,"Quantum cybernetics and its connections to complex quantum systems science is addressed from the perspective of complex quantum computing systems. In this way, the notion of an autonomous quantum computing system is introduced in regards to quantum artificial intelligence, and applied to quantum artificial neural networks, considered as autonomous quantum computing systems, which leads to a quantum connectionist framework within quantum cybernetics for complex quantum computing systems. Several examples of quantum feedforward neural networks are addressed in regards to Boolean functions' computation, multilayer quantum computation dynamics, entanglement and quantum complementarity.

An Introduction to Complex Systems Science and its Applications,"Alexander F. Siegenfeld, Yaneer Bar-Yam","The standard assumptions that underlie many conceptual and quantitative frameworks do not hold for many complex physical, biological, and social systems. Complex systems science clarifies when and why such assumptions fail and provides alternative frameworks for understanding the properties of complex systems. This review introduces some of the basic principles of complex systems science, including complexity profiles, the tradeoff between efficiency and adaptability, the necessity of matching the complexity of systems to that of their environments, multi-scale analysis, and evolutionary processes. Our focus is on the general properties of systems as opposed to the modeling of specific dynamics; rather than provide a comprehensive review, we pedagogically describe a conceptual and analytic approach for understanding and interacting with the complex systems of our world. With the exception of a few footnotes, this paper assumes only a high school mathematical and scientific background, so that it may be accessible to academics in all fields, decision-makers in industry, government, and philanthropy, and anyone who is interested in systems and society.",2019-12-11T02:36:57Z,2020-05-26T05:24:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05088v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05088v2,physics.soc-ph
Software Uncertainty in Integrated Environmental Modelling: the role of   Semantics and Open Science,Daniele de Rigo,"Computational aspects increasingly shape environmental sciences. Actually, transdisciplinary modelling of complex and uncertain environmental systems is challenging computational science (CS) and also the science-policy interface. Large spatial-scale problems falling within this category - i.e. wide-scale transdisciplinary modelling for environment (WSTMe) - often deal with factors (a) for which deep-uncertainty may prevent usual statistical analysis of modelled quantities and need different ways for providing policy-making with science-based support. Here, practical recommendations are proposed for tempering a peculiar - not infrequently underestimated - source of uncertainty. Software errors in complex WSTMe may subtly affect the outcomes with possible consequences even on collective environmental decision-making. Semantic transparency in CS and free software are discussed as possible mitigations.",2013-11-19T15:00:26Z,2014-02-10T16:44:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4762v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4762v2,"cs.SY, cs.CE"

Under the assumptions, it is proved that the original problem can be homogenized, and the solution weakly converges. We derive an $O(\epsilon^{1/2})$ estimation which is pivotal in building the computational framework. We also show that Robin problems--- a special case of contact problems, it leads to an $O(\epsilon)$ estimation in $L^2$ norm.

Output Feedback Controller Design with Symbolic Observers for   Cyber-physical Systems,"Masashi Mizoguchi, Toshimitsu Ushio","In this paper, we design a symbolic output feedback controller of a cyber-physical system (CPS). The physical plant is modeled by an infinite transition system. We consider the situation that a finite abstracted system of the physical plant, called a c-abstracted system, is given. There exists an approximate alternating simulation relation from the c-abstracted system to the physical plant. A desired behavior of the c-abstracted system is also given, and we have a symbolic state feedback controller of the physical plant. We consider the case where some states of the plant are not measured. Then, to estimate the states with abstracted outputs measured by sensors, we introduce a finite abstracted system of the physical plant, called an o-abstracted system, such that there exists an approximate simulation relation. The relation guarantees that an observer designed based on the state of the o-abstracted system estimates the current state of the plant. We construct a symbolic output feedback controller by composing these systems. By a relation-based approach, we proved that the controlled system approximately exhibits the desired behavior.",2016-12-15T08:48:23Z,2016-12-15T08:48:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04974v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04974v1,"cs.SY, B.5.1;I.2.8"

Deep Fuzzy Systems,Khaled Ahmed Nagaty,An investigation of deep fuzzy systems is presented in this paper. A deep fuzzy system is represented by recursive fuzzy systems from an input terminal to output terminal. Recursive fuzzy systems are sequences of fuzzy grade memberships obtained using fuzzy transmition functions and recursive calls to fuzzy systems. A recursive fuzzy system which calls a fuzzy system n times includes fuzzy chains to evaluate the final grade membership of this recursive system. A connection matrix which includes recursive calls are used to represent recursive fuzzy systems.,2019-05-23T08:48:37Z,2019-05-23T08:48:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08222v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08222v1,"cs.OH, cs.AI"

""IMP Science Gateway Portal"" (http://scigate.imp.kiev.ua) for complex workflow management and integration of distributed computing resources (like clusters, service grids, desktop grids, clouds) is presented. It is created on the basis of WS-PGRADE and gUSE technologies, where WS-PGRADE is designed for science workflow operation and gUSE - for smooth integration of available resources for parallel and distributed computing in various heterogeneous distributed computing infrastructures (DCI). The typical scientific workflows with possible scenarios of its preparation and usage are presented. Several typical use cases for these science applications (scientific workflows) are considered for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex behavior of various nanostructures (nanoindentation of graphene layers, defect system relaxation in metal nanocrystals, thermal stability of boron nitride nanotubes, etc.). The user experience is analyzed in the context of its practical applications for MD simulations in materials science, physics and nanotechnologies with available heterogeneous DCIs. In conclusion, the ""science gateway"" approach - workflow manager (like WS-PGRADE) + DCI resources manager (like gUSE)- gives opportunity to use the SG portal (like ""IMP Science Gateway Portal"") in a very promising way, namely, as a hub of various virtual experimental labs (different software components + various requirements to resources) in the context of its practical MD applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnologies.",2014-04-22T11:55:17Z,2014-04-22T11:55:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5611v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5611v1,"cs.CE, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.DC"

This is because they would still be able to affect each other by interacting with the bath.

Science In Trauma,Bhag C. Chauhan,"Quantum theory has been proved as an outstanding mystery in modern science. The predictions of science have turned out to be probabilistic. The principle of determinism has failed. For systems like weather, earthquakes, rolling dices etc... and of course human behavior it has proved impossible, for science, to describe a state of the system accurately for a long time into the future. Moreover, modern cosmology has to rely on philosophical assumptions. It is argued -- by taking into account of the views of learned scientists and philosophers -- that modern science can never explain everything and it is a hard fact to discover the ``Theory Of Everything''. On the other hand, modern scientific technology have damaged our environment and posed serious threats for the future development of science. All these facts and results put a big question-mark (?) on the grass-root level working of science. In fact, all scientific researches are based upon ordinary sense perception, which keeps the outer physical universe as a separate entity, that is something quite independent of the observer. Basically, it is the observer -- the knower -- which makes perception possible. Astonishingly, the knower -- human mind -- is not included in our scientific theories. One should not forget human-being (human mind) is a part of nature and an essential component of our observations, so it's inclusion in scientific theories is must in order to recover modern science from the drastic state of trauma.",2002-10-22T17:07:35Z,2005-09-23T14:58:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0210088v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0210088v2,physics.pop-ph
Design Guidelines for the User-Centred Collaborative Citizen Science   Platforms,"Poonam Yadav, John Darlington","Online Citizen Science platforms are good examples of socio-technical systems where technology-enabled interactions occur between scientists and the general public (volunteers). Citizen Science platforms usually host multiple Citizen Science projects, and allow volunteers to choose the ones to participate in. Recent work in the area has demonstrated a positive feedback loop between participation and learning and creativity in Citizen Science projects, which is one of the motivating factors both for scientists and the volunteers. This emphasises the importance of creating successful Citizen Science platforms, which support this feedback process, and enable enhanced learning and creativity to occur through knowledge sharing and diverse participation. In this paper, we discuss how scientists' and volunteers' motivation and participation influence the design of Citizen Science platforms. We present our summary as guidelines for designing these platforms as user-inspired socio-technical systems. We also present the case-studies on popular Citizen Science platforms, including our own CitizenGrid platform, developed as part of the CCL EU project, as well as Zooniverse, World Community Grid, CrowdCrafting and EpiCollect+ to see how closely these platforms follow our proposed guidelines and how these may be further improved to incorporate the creativity enabled by the collective knowledge sharing.",2016-05-03T13:51:54Z,2016-05-03T13:51:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00910v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00910v1,"cs.HC, cs.CY, cs.DC, cs.SI"

We focus on pure states that do not have the `cluster property.' Such a pure state is entangled macroscopically, and is quite anomalous in view of many-body physics because it does not approach any pure state in the infinite-size limit. However, we often encounter such anomalous states when studying finite macroscopic systems, such as quantum computers with many qubits and finite systems that will exhibit symmetry breaking in the infinite-size limit. We study stabilities of such anomalous states in general systems. In contrast to the previous works, we obtain general and universal results, by making full use of the locality of the theory.

Ocean science is a multidisciplinary discipline developing scientific models and simulations as ocean system models that are an essential research asset.   In software engineering and information systems research, modeling is also an essential activity. In particular, business process modeling for business process management and systems engineering is the activity of representing processes of an enterprise, so that the current process may be analyzed, improved, and automated.   In this paper, we employ process modeling for analyzing scientific software development in ocean science to advance the state in engineering of ocean system models and to better understand how ocean system models are developed and maintained in ocean science. We interviewed domain experts in semi-structured interviews, analyzed the results via thematic analysis, and modeled the results via the business process modeling notation BPMN.

In a knowledge-based economy science fulfills functions that change the definitions of what is considered research and globalization has changed the relevance of national systems of reference. Science, of course, has been internationally oriented from its very beginning, but the entrainment of the research process in these global developments is reflected in the research evaluation and the scientometric measurement. In other words, the systems under study have become more complex. A complex dynamics can analytically be decomposed in several subdynamics. The evolving systems and subsystems communicate in different dimensions and the evaluation has become part of the codification of these communications.",2009-11-22T21:51:37Z,2009-11-22T21:51:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4298v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.4298v1,physics.soc-ph
Evaluation of A Resilience Embedded System Using Probabilistic   Model-Checking,"Ling Fang, Yoriyuki Yamagata, Yutaka Oiwa","If a Micro Processor Unit (MPU) receives an external electric signal as noise, the system function will freeze or malfunction easily. A new resilience strategy is implemented in order to reset the MPU automatically and stop the MPU from freezing or malfunctioning. The technique is useful for embedded systems which work in non-human environments. However, evaluating resilience strategies is difficult because their effectiveness depends on numerous, complex, interacting factors.   In this paper, we use probabilistic model checking to evaluate the embedded systems installed with the above mentioned new resilience strategy. Qualitative evaluations are implemented with 6 PCTL formulas, and quantitative evaluations use two kinds of evaluation. One is system failure reduction, and the other is ADT (Average Down Time), the industry standard. Our work demonstrates the benefits brought by the resilience strategy. Experimental results indicate that our evaluation is cost-effective and reliable.",2014-05-06T00:53:56Z,2014-05-06T00:53:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1703v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.1703v1,"cs.SE, cs.LO, math.PR"

Following the successful launch of Herschel 14th of May 2009 the Herschel Data Processing System demonstrated its maturity when the first PACS preview observation of M51 was processed within 30 minutes of reception of the first science data after launch. Also the first HIFI observations on DR21 were successfully reduced to high quality spectra, followed by SPIRE observations on M66 and M74. A fast turn-around cycle between data retrieval and the production of science-ready products was demonstrated during the Herschel Science Demonstration Phase Initial Results Workshop held 7 months after launch, which is a clear proof that the system has reached a good level of maturity.

Agile System Development Lifecycle for AI Systems: Decision Architecture,Asif Q. Gill,"Agile system development life cycle (SDLC) focuses on typical functional and non-functional system requirements for developing traditional software systems. However, Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems are different in nature and have distinct attributes such as (1) autonomy, (2) adaptiveness, (3) content generation, (4) decision-making, (5) predictability and (6) recommendation. Agile SDLC needs to be enhanced to support the AI system development and ongoing post-deployment adaptation. The challenge is: how can agile SDLC be enhanced to support AI systems? The scope of this paper is limited to AI system enabled decision automation. Thus, this paper proposes the use of decision science to enhance the agile SDLC to support the AI system development. Decision science is the study of decision-making, which seems useful to identify, analyse and describe decisions and their architecture subject to automation via AI systems. Specifically, this paper discusses the decision architecture in detail within the overall context of agile SDLC for AI systems. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the help of an example scenario of insurance claim processing. This initial work indicated the usability of a decision science to enhancing the agile SDLC for designing and implementing the AI systems for decision-automation. This work provides an initial foundation for further work in this new area of decision architecture and agile SDLC for AI systems.",2025-01-16T10:04:19Z,2025-01-17T04:36:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09434v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09434v2,cs.SE
On optimising cost and value in compute systems for radio astronomy,"P. Chris Broekema, Verity L. Allan, Rob V. van Nieuwpoort, Henri E. Bal","Large-scale science instruments, such as the distributed radio telescope LOFAR, show that we are in an era of data-intensive scientific discovery. Such instruments rely critically on significant computing resources, both hardware and software, to do science. Considering limited science budgets, and the small fraction of these that can be dedicated to compute hardware and software, there is a strong and obvious desire for low-cost computing. However, optimising for cost is only part of the equation; the value potential over the lifetime of the solution should also be taken into account. Using a tangible example, compute hardware, we introduce a conceptual model to approximate the lifetime relative science value of such a system. While the introduced model is not intended to result in a numeric value for merit, it does enumerate some components that define this metric. The intent of this paper is to show how compute system related design and procurement decisions in data-intensive science projects should be weighed and valued. By using both total cost and science value as a driver, the science output per invested Euro is maximised. With a number of case studies, focused on computing applications in radio astronomy past, present and future, we show that the hardware-based analysis can be, and has been, applied more broadly.",2018-06-18T11:54:53Z,2019-10-17T07:24:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06606v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06606v3,astro-ph.IM

This paper brings together multiple perspectives: from individual researchers seeking the best options to display their activities and market their skills on the academic job market; to academic institutions, national funding agencies, and countries needing to monitor the science system and account for public money spending. We also address the research interests aimed at better understanding the self-organising and complex nature of the science system through researcher tracing, the identification of the emergence of new fields, and knowledge discovery using large-data mining and non-linear dynamics. In particular this paper draws attention to the need for standardisation and data interoperability in the area of research information as an indispensable pre-condition for any science modelling. We discuss which levels of complexity are needed to provide a globally, interoperable, and expressive data infrastructure for research information.

In effect, building a trusted operating system that can mostly resist attacks and provide a secure computing environment to protect the important assets of a computer is the goal of every operating system manufacturer. This paper deeply investigates the various security features of the two most widespread and successful operating systems, Microsoft Windows and Linux.

Change-Of-Bases Abstractions for Non-Linear Systems,Sriram Sankaranarayanan,"We present abstraction techniques that transform a given non-linear dynamical system into a linear system or an algebraic system described by polynomials of bounded degree, such that, invariant properties of the resulting abstraction can be used to infer invariants for the original system. The abstraction techniques rely on a change-of-basis transformation that associates each state variable of the abstract system with a function involving the state variables of the original system. We present conditions under which a given change of basis transformation for a non-linear system can define an abstraction. Furthermore, the techniques developed here apply to continuous systems defined by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), discrete systems defined by transition systems and hybrid systems that combine continuous as well as discrete subsystems. The techniques presented here allow us to discover, given a non-linear system, if a change of bases transformation involving degree-bounded polynomials yielding an algebraic abstraction exists. If so, our technique yields the resulting abstract system, as well. This approach is further extended to search for a change of bases transformation that abstracts a given non-linear system into a system of linear differential inclusions. Our techniques enable the use of analysis techniques for linear systems to infer invariants for non-linear systems.

Science DMZ Networks: How Different are They Really?,"Emily Mutter, Susmit Shannigrahi","The Science Demilitarized Zone (Science DMZ) is a network environment optimized for scientific applications. A Science DMZ provides an environment mostly free from competing traffic flows and complex security middleware such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems that often impede data transfer performance. The Science DMZ model provides a reference set of network design patterns, tuned hosts and protocol stacks dedicated to large data transfers and streamlined security postures that significantly improve data transfer performance, accelerating scientific collaborations and discovery.   Over the past decade, many universities and organizations have adopted this model for their research computing. Despite becoming increasingly popular, there is a lack of quantitative studies comparing such a specialized network to conventional production networks regarding network characteristics and data transfer performance. We strive to answer the following research questions in this study: Does a Science DMZ exhibit significantly different behavior than a general-purpose campus network? Does it improve application performance compared to such general-purpose networks? Through a two-year-long quantitative network measurement study, we find that a Science DMZ exhibits lower latency, higher throughput, and lower jitter behaviors. However, we also see several non-intuitive results. For example, a DMZ may take a longer route to external destinations and experience higher latency than the campus network. While the DMZ model benefits researchers, the benefits are not automatic - careful network tuning based on specific use cases is required to realize the full potential of such infrastructure.",2024-07-01T21:43:41Z,2024-07-01T21:43:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01822v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01822v1,"math.NA, cs.NA, cs.NI"

System Science in Politics -- Europe and the War in Ukraine,Juergen Mimkes,"Peace means order, and war brings disorder and chaos to any society. But order and disorder are not only observed in wars, in many systems they are the dominant property. Understanding order and disorder enables us to understand the structure of systems. Order and disorder are also part of the Lagrange Principle, and as statistics is valid in all systems, we may regard Lagrange statistics as a mathematical basis of system science. Two systems out of natural and social science are compared: materials of trillions of atoms and politics of millions of people. Lagrange statistics leads to three phases of homogeneous systems: in materials we have the states: solid, liquid, gas, depending on two Lagrange parameters, temperature T (the mean energy of atoms) and pressure p. In politics we have three states: autocratic, democratic, global, depending on two Lagrange parameters, standard of living T (the mean capital of people) and political pressure p. The three phases of each system are compared in the p-T phase diagram: Different phases of one system cannot coexist as nearest neighbors: Water will dissolve ice by exchange of atoms and heat. This leads to the present climate crisis. Democracies will dissolve autocracies by exchange of goods, ideas, and people like guest workers. This is the peaceful history of the EU and has led to the aggressive reaction of Russia in the GDR, Hungary, \v{C}SR, and now in the Ukraine. At the end of war peaceful coexistence will not be possible between Russia and Ukraine.

On Systemic Destruction of Human Locomotor System,"Zoja Medjanik, Lyudmila Popova, Sergiy Popov","Locomotor system disorders affect a vast majority of people at some time in their life bringing pain, functional limitations, social and economic implications. Modern medicine cannot offer prevention and effective treatment for most chronic musculoskeletal conditions, because their etiology and pathogenesis are unknown. This is due to the lack of systemic understanding of the locomotor system functioning in both healthy and unhealthy states. Here we apply systems sciences to analyze the human locomotor system and develop a general theory that reveals the systemic destructive process in the locomotor system, linking together all its disorders. The systemic destruction involves adaptation and self-organization processes in the locomotor system, whose side effects introduce a positive feedback loop with nervous and vascular disturbances. Most chronic musculoskeletal conditions are just manifestations and consequences of this process. On the basis of our theoretical findings, we developed the world's first technology that effectively counteracts the systemic destruction and improves the locomotor system state at any age, also preventing problems in nervous and cardiovascular systems.",2013-03-10T15:05:51Z,2013-03-10T15:05:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2935v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2935v1,"q-bio.TO, physics.med-ph"
Response Functions to Critical Shocks in Social Sciences: An Empirical   and Numerical Study,"M. Roehner, D. Sornette, J. V. Andersen","We show that, provided one focuses on properly selected episodes, one can apply to the social sciences the same observational strategy that has proved successful in natural sciences such as astrophysics or geodynamics. For instance, in order to probe the cohesion of a policy, one can, in different countries, study the reactions to some huge and sudden exogenous shocks, which we call Dirac shocks. This approach naturally leads to the notion of structural (as opposed or complementary to temporal) forecast. Although structural predictions are by far the most common way to test theories in the natural sciences, they have been much less used in the social sciences. The Dirac shock approach opens the way to testing structural predictions in the social sciences. The examples reported here suggest that critical events are able to reveal pre-existing ``cracks'' because they probe the social cohesion which is an indicator and predictor of future evolution of the system, and in some cases foreshadows a bifurcation. We complement our empirical work with numerical simulations of the response function (``damage spreading'') to Dirac shocks in the Sznajd model of consensus build-up. We quantify the slow relaxation of the difference between perturbed and unperturbed systems, the conditions under which the consensus is modified by the shock and the large variability from one realization to another.",2004-02-16T09:21:59Z,2004-02-16T09:21:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0402408v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0402408v1,cond-mat.stat-mech

"Quality related publication categories in social sciences and   humanities, based on a university's peer review assessments","Nadine Rons, Arlette De Bruyn","Bibliometric analysis has firmly conquered its place as an instrument for evaluation and international comparison of performance levels. Consequently, differences in coverage by standard bibliometric databases installed a dichotomy between on the one hand the well covered 'exact' sciences, and on the other hand most of the social sciences and humanities with a more limited coverage (Nederhof, 2006). Also the latter domains need to be able to soundly demonstrate their level of performance and claim or legitimate funding accordingly. An important part of the output volume in social sciences appears as books, book chapters and national literature (Hicks, 2004). To proceed from publication data to performance measurement, quantitative publication counts need to be combined with qualitative information, for example from peer assessment or validation (European Expert Group on Assessment of University-Based Research, 2010), to identify those categories that represent research quality as perceived by peers. An accurate focus is crucial in order to stimulate, recognize and reward high quality achievements only. This paper demonstrates how such a selection of publication categories can be based on correlations with peer judgments. It is also illustrated that the selection should be sufficiently precise, to avoid subcategories negatively correlated with peer judgments. The findings indicate that, also in social sciences and humanities, publications in journals with an international referee system are the most important category for evaluating quality. Book chapters with international referee system and contributions in international conference proceedings follow them.",2013-07-25T15:10:14Z,2013-07-25T15:10:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6773v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.6773v1,cs.DL

Auster, L. I. Gurvits, W. Hajdas","We present a study of an impacting descent probe that increases the science return of spacecraft orbiting or passing an atmosphere-less planetary body of the solar system, such as the Galilean moons of Jupiter. The descent probe is a carry-on small spacecraft (< 100 kg), to be deployed by the mother spacecraft, that brings itself onto a collisional trajectory with the targeted planetary body in a simple manner. A possible science payload includes instruments for surface imaging, characterisation of the neutral exosphere, and magnetic field and plasma measurement near the target body down to very low-altitudes (~1 km), during the probe's fast (~km/s) descent to the surface until impact. The science goals and the concept of operation are discussed with particular reference to Europa, including options for flying through water plumes and after-impact retrieval of very-low altitude science data. All in all, it is demonstrated how the descent probe has the potential to provide a high science return to a mission at a low extra level of complexity, engineering effort, and risk. This study builds upon earlier studies for a Callisto Descent Probe (CDP) for the former Europa-Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) of ESA and NASA, and extends them with a detailed assessment of a descent probe designed to be an additional science payload for the NASA Europa Mission.",2017-11-07T13:16:55Z,2017-11-07T13:16:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02452v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02452v1,astro-ph.EP
JITA4DS: Disaggregated execution of Data Science Pipelines between the   Edge and the Data Centre,"Genoveva Vargas-Solar, Ali Akoglu, Md Sahil Hassan","This paper targets the execution of data science (DS) pipelines supported by data processing, transmission and sharing across several resources executing greedy processes. Current data science pipelines environments provide various infrastructure services with computing resources such as general-purpose processors (GPP), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) coupled with platform and software services to design, run and maintain DS pipelines. These one-fits-all solutions impose the complete externalization of data pipeline tasks. However, some tasks can be executed in the edge, and the backend can provide just in time resources to ensure ad-hoc and elastic execution environments.   This paper introduces an innovative composable ""Just in Time Architecture"" for configuring DCs for Data Science Pipelines (JITA-4DS) and associated resource management techniques. JITA-4DS is a cross-layer management system that is aware of both the application characteristics and the underlying infrastructures to break the barriers between applications, middleware/operating system, and hardware layers. Vertical integration of these layers is needed for building a customizable Virtual Data Center (VDC) to meet the dynamically changing data science pipelines' requirements such as performance, availability, and energy consumption. Accordingly, the paper shows an experimental simulation devoted to run data science workloads and determine the best strategies for scheduling the allocation of resources implemented by JITA-4DS.",2021-08-05T12:24:43Z,2021-08-05T12:24:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02558v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02558v1,cs.DC
On the Role of Triadic Substructures in Complex Networks,Marco Winkler,"In the course of the growth of the Internet and due to increasing availability of data, over the last two decades, the field of network science has established itself as an own area of research. With quantitative scientists from computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from biology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network science serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major goals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological graph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from the same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure. However, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically implies likewise function. This dissertation aims at helping to bridge this gap, while particularly focusing on the role of triadic structures. After a general introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work devoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major challenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node subgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may participate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle, a novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic building blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs - subgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at random - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs. Finally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical processes acting on their nodes is studied. It is observed that certain motifs impose clear signatures on the systems' dynamics, even when embedded in a larger network structure.",2015-07-30T13:56:48Z,2015-07-30T13:56:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03989v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03989v1,"cs.SI, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.data-an, physics.soc-ph"

Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Symbolic Computation   in Software Science,Temur Kutsia,"This volume contains papers presented at the Ninth International Symposium on Symbolic Computation in Software Science, SCSS 2021.   Symbolic Computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects (terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic objects, etc.). Powerful algorithms have been developed during the past decades for the major subareas of symbolic computation: computer algebra and computational logic. These algorithms and methods are successfully applied in various fields, including software science, which covers a broad range of topics about software construction and analysis.   Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and machine learning algorithms are widely used nowadays in various domains and, in particular, combined with symbolic computation. Several approaches mix artificial intelligence and symbolic methods and tools deployed over large corpora to create what is known as cognitive systems. Cognitive computing focuses on building systems that interact with humans naturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale.   The purpose of SCSS is to promote research on theoretical and practical aspects of symbolic computation in software science, combined with modern artificial intelligence techniques. These proceedings contain the keynote paper by Bruno Buchberger and ten contributed papers. Besides, the conference program included three invited talks, nine short and work-in-progress papers, and a special session on computer algebra and computational logic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the symposium was held completely online. It was organized by the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) of the Johannes Kepler University Linz on September 8--10, 2021.",2021-09-06T14:22:11Z,2021-09-06T14:22:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02501v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02501v1,"cs.SC, cs.AI, cs.LO, cs.SE"
Advancing Perception in Artificial Intelligence through Principles of   Cognitive Science,"Palaash Agrawal, Cheston Tan, Heena Rathore","Although artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved many feats at a rapid pace, there still exist open problems and fundamental shortcomings related to performance and resource efficiency. Since AI researchers benchmark a significant proportion of performance standards through human intelligence, cognitive sciences-inspired AI is a promising domain of research. Studying cognitive science can provide a fresh perspective to building fundamental blocks in AI research, which can lead to improved performance and efficiency. In this review paper, we focus on the cognitive functions of perception, which is the process of taking signals from one's surroundings as input, and processing them to understand the environment. Particularly, we study and compare its various processes through the lens of both cognitive sciences and AI. Through this study, we review all current major theories from various sub-disciplines of cognitive science (specifically neuroscience, psychology and linguistics), and draw parallels with theories and techniques from current practices in AI. We, hence, present a detailed collection of methods in AI for researchers to build AI systems inspired by cognitive science. Further, through the process of reviewing the state of cognitive-inspired AI, we point out many gaps in the current state of AI (with respect to the performance of the human brain), and hence present potential directions for researchers to develop better perception systems in AI.",2023-10-13T01:21:55Z,2023-10-13T01:21:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08803v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08803v1,cs.AI
AI and Machine Learning for Next Generation Science Assessments,Xiaoming Zhai,"This chapter focuses on the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in science assessments. The paper begins with a discussion of the Framework for K-12 Science Education, which calls for a shift from conceptual learning to knowledge-in-use. This shift necessitates the development of new types of assessments that align with the Framework's three dimensions: science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts. The paper further highlights the limitations of traditional assessment methods like multiple-choice questions, which often fail to capture the complexities of scientific thinking and three-dimensional learning in science. It emphasizes the need for performance-based assessments that require students to engage in scientific practices like modeling, explanation, and argumentation. The paper achieves three major goals: reviewing the current state of ML-based assessments in science education, introducing a framework for scoring accuracy in ML-based automatic assessments, and discussing future directions and challenges. It delves into the evolution of ML-based automatic scoring systems, discussing various types of ML, like supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. These systems can provide timely and objective feedback, thus alleviating the burden on teachers. The paper concludes by exploring pre-trained models like BERT and finetuned ChatGPT, which have shown promise in assessing students' written responses effectively.",2024-04-23T01:39:20Z,2024-04-23T01:39:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06660v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06660v1,"physics.ed-ph, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.LG"
CourseAssist: Pedagogically Appropriate AI Tutor for Computer Science   Education,"Ty Feng, Sa Liu, Dipak Ghosal","The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.",2024-05-01T20:43:06Z,2024-07-29T23:01:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10246v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10246v3,"cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.HC"
"Advances in Data Combination, Analysis and Collection for System   Reliability Assessment","Alyson G. Wilson, Todd L. Graves, Michael S. Hamada, C. Shane Reese","The systems that statisticians are asked to assess, such as nuclear weapons, infrastructure networks, supercomputer codes and munitions, have become increasingly complex. It is often costly to conduct full system tests. As such, we present a review of methodology that has been proposed for addressing system reliability with limited full system testing. The first approaches presented in this paper are concerned with the combination of multiple sources of information to assess the reliability of a single component. The second general set of methodology addresses the combination of multiple levels of data to determine system reliability. We then present developments for complex systems beyond traditional series/parallel representations through the use of Bayesian networks and flowgraph models. We also include methodological contributions to resource allocation considerations for system relability assessment. We illustrate each method with applications primarily encountered at Los Alamos National Laboratory.",2007-08-02T14:42:06Z,2007-08-02T14:42:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0355v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.0355v1,stat.ME
Some Models and Tools for Open Systems,"Axel Legay, Marco Faella","In computer science, there is a distinction between closed systems, whose behavior is totally determined in advance, and open systems, that are systems maintaining a constant interaction with an unspecified environment. Closed systems are naturally modeled by transitions systems. Open systems have been modeled in various ways, including process algebras, I/O automata, ``modules'', and interfaces. Games provide a uniform setting in which all these models can be cast and compared. In this paper, we discuss the features and costs related to the game-based approach to open systems, referring to some of the existing models. Finally, we describe a new model of interface, called sociable interface, which is geared towards easier specification, improved reusability of models, and efficient symbolic implementation.",2009-11-17T13:21:31Z,2009-11-17T13:21:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3299v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3299v1,"cs.LO, F.4.3; F.4.1"
Architecture of Network Management Tools for Heterogeneous System,"Rosilah Hassan, Rozilawati Razali, Shima Mohseni, Ola Mohamad, Zahian Ismail","Managing heterogeneous network systems is a difficult task because each of these networks has its own curious management system. These networks usually are constructed on independent management protocols which are not compatible with each other. This results in the coexistence of many management systems with different managing functions and services across enterprises. Incompatibility of different management systems makes management of whole system a very complex and often complicated job. Ideally, it is necessary to implement centralized metalevel management across distributed heterogeneous systems and their underlying supporting network systems where the information flow and guidance is provided via a single console or single operating panels which integrates all the management functions in spite of their individual protocols and structures. This paper attempts to provide a novel network management tool architecture which supports heterogeneous managements across many different architectural platforms. Furthermore, an architectural approach to integrate heterogeneous network is proposed. This architecture takes into account both wireless fixed and mobile nodes.",2010-01-12T18:14:30Z,2010-01-12T18:14:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1967v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1967v1,cs.NI

Similar to most research on effective sensors' characteristics, especially in control systems, our focus is on sensors' accuracy and frequency response. A rule-based fuzzy system is presented for fusion of raw data obtained from the sensors that have complement characteristics in accuracy and bandwidth. Furthermore, a fuzzy predictor system is suggested aiming for extreme accuracy which is a common need in highly sensitive applications. Advantages of our proposed sensor fusion system are shown by simulation of a control system utilizing the fusion system for output estimation.",2010-10-28T21:08:44Z,2019-09-08T20:06:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.6096v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.6096v2,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

A Complete Axiomatization of Quantified Differential Dynamic Logic for   Distributed Hybrid Systems,Andre Platzer,"We address a fundamental mismatch between the combinations of dynamics that occur in cyber-physical systems and the limited kinds of dynamics supported in analysis. Modern applications combine communication, computation, and control. They may even form dynamic distributed networks, where neither structure nor dimension stay the same while the system follows hybrid dynamics, i.e., mixed discrete and continuous dynamics. We provide the logical foundations for closing this analytic gap. We develop a formal model for distributed hybrid systems. It combines quantified differential equations with quantified assignments and dynamic dimensionality-changes. We introduce a dynamic logic for verifying distributed hybrid systems and present a proof calculus for this logic. This is the first formal verification approach for distributed hybrid systems. We prove that our calculus is a sound and complete axiomatization of the behavior of distributed hybrid systems relative to quantified differential equations. In our calculus we have proven collision freedom in distributed car control even when an unbounded number of new cars may appear dynamically on the road.",2012-06-15T01:33:02Z,2012-11-22T14:10:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3357v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3357v3,"cs.LO, cs.PL, math.DS, F.3.1, F.4.1, D.2.4, C.1.m, C.2.4, D.4.7"
"Behavior, Organization, Substance: Three Gestalts of General Systems   Theory",Vincenzo De Florio,"The term gestalt, when used in the context of general systems theory, assumes the value of ""systemic touchstone"", namely a figure of reference used to categorize the properties or qualities of a set of systems. Typical gestalts used in biology are those based on anatomical or physiological characteristics, which correspond respectively to architectural and organizational design choices in natural and artificial systems. In this paper we discuss three gestalts of general systems theory: behavior, organization, and substance, which refer respectively to the works of Wiener, Boulding, and Leibniz. Our major focus here is the system introduced by the latter. Through a discussion of some of the elements of the Leibnitian System, and by means of several novel interpretations of those elements in terms of today's computer science, we highlight the debt that contemporary research still has with this Giant among the giant scholars of the past.",2014-03-17T12:13:49Z,2015-05-21T08:09:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4077v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4077v2,cs.OH
A Game-Theoretic Framework for Studying Dynamics of Multi Decision-maker   Systems,Mohammad Rasouli,"System Dynamics (SD) main aim is to study dynamic behavior of systems based on causal relations. The other purpose of the science is to design policies, both in initial values and causal relation, to change system behavior as we desire. Especially we are interested in making systems behavior a convergent one. Although now SD is mainly used in situations of single policy maker, there are major parts of situations in which there are multi policy makers playing role. Game Theory (GT) is an appropriate tool for studying such cases.GT is the theory of studying multi decision-maker conditions. In this paper we will introduce GT and explain how to apply it in SD.

Complex systems: physics beyond physics,"Yurij Holovatch, Ralph Kenna, Stefan Thurner","Complex systems are characterized by specific time-dependent interactions among their many constituents. As a consequence they often manifest rich, non-trivial and unexpected behavior. Examples arise both in the physical and non-physical world. The study of complex systems forms a new interdisciplinary research area that cuts across physics, biology, ecology, economics, sociology, and the humanities. In this paper we review the essence of complex systems from a physicist's point of view, and try to clarify what makes them conceptually different from systems that are traditionally studied in physics. Our goal is to demonstrate how the dynamics of such systems may be conceptualized in quantitative and predictive terms by extending notions from statistical physics and how they can often be captured in a framework of co-evolving multiplex network structures. We mention three areas of complex-systems science that are currently studied extensively, the science of cities, dynamics of societies, and the representation of texts as evolutionary objects. We discuss why these areas form complex systems in the above sense.

Ranking Functions for Vector Addition Systems,Florian Zuleger,"Vector addition systems are an important model in theoretical computer science and have been used for the analysis of systems in a variety of areas. Termination is a crucial property of vector addition systems and has received considerable interest in the literature. In this paper we give a complete method for the construction of ranking functions for vector addition systems with states. The interest in ranking functions is motivated by the fact that ranking functions provide valuable additional information in case of termination: They provide an explanation for the progress of the vector addition system, which can be reported to the user of a verification tool, and can be used as certificates for termination. Moreover, we show how ranking functions can be used for the computational complexity analysis of vector addition systems (here complexity refers to the number of steps the vector addition system under analysis can take in terms of the given initial vector).",2017-10-23T09:22:06Z,2017-10-23T09:22:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10292v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10292v1,cs.LO
The Polynomial Complexity of Vector Addition Systems with States,Florian Zuleger,"Vector addition systems are an important model in theoretical computer science and have been used in a variety of areas. In this paper, we consider vector addition systems with states over a parameterized initial configuration. For these systems, we are interested in the standard notion of computational complexity, i.e., we want to understand the length of the longest trace for a fixed vector addition system with states depending on the size of the initial configuration. We show that the asymptotic complexity of a given vector addition system with states is either $\Theta(N^k)$ for some computable integer $k$, where $N$ is the size of the initial configuration, or at least exponential. We further show that $k$ can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the considered vector addition system. Finally, we show that $1 \le k \le 2^n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the considered vector addition system.",2019-07-01T21:09:19Z,2020-03-14T19:34:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01076v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01076v3,"cs.FL, cs.CC, cs.LO"
On the convergence of sequences in the space of $n$-iterated function   systems with applications,"Praveen M, Sunil Mathew","This article discusses the notion of convergence of sequences of iterated function systems. The technique of iterated function systems is one of the several methods to construct objects with fractal nature, and the fractals obtained with this method are mostly self-similar. The progress in the theory of fractals has found potential applications in the fields of physical science, computer science, and economics in abundance. This paper considers the metric space of $n$- iterated function systems by introducing a metric function on the set of all iterated function systems on a complete metric space consisting of $n$ contraction functions. Further, sequences of $n$- iterated function systems with decreasing, eventually decreasing, Cauchy and convergent properties are discussed.

Geometric path augmentation for inference of sparsely observed   stochastic nonlinear systems,Dimitra Maoutsa,"Stochastic evolution equations describing the dynamics of systems under the influence of both deterministic and stochastic forces are prevalent in all fields of science. Yet, identifying these systems from sparse-in-time observations remains still a challenging endeavour. Existing approaches focus either on the temporal structure of the observations by relying on conditional expectations, discarding thereby information ingrained in the geometry of the system's invariant density; or employ geometric approximations of the invariant density, which are nevertheless restricted to systems with conservative forces. Here we propose a method that reconciles these two paradigms. We introduce a new data-driven path augmentation scheme that takes the local observation geometry into account. By employing non-parametric inference on the augmented paths, we can efficiently identify the deterministic driving forces of the underlying system for systems observed at low sampling rates.",2023-01-19T14:45:03Z,2023-01-19T14:45:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08102v1,"physics.data-an, cs.LG, math-ph, math.DS, math.MP, stat.ME"
Scientific Data Management in the Coming Decade,"Jim Gray, David T. Liu, Maria Nieto-Santisteban, Alexander S.

It argues that peta-scale datasets will be housed by science centers that provide substantial storage and processing for scientists who access the data via smart notebooks. Next-generation science instruments and simulations will generate these peta-scale datasets. The need to publish and share data and the need for generic analysis and visualization tools will finally create a convergence on common metadata standards. Database systems will be judged by their support of these metadata standards and by their ability to manage and access peta-scale datasets. The procedural stream-of-bytes-file-centric approach to data analysis is both too cumbersome and too serial for such large datasets.

Science With The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder,Simon Johnston,"The future of cm and m-wave astronomy lies with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope under development by a consortium of 17 countries that will be 50 times more sensitive than any existing radio facility.

The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a technology demonstrator aimed in the mid-frequency range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and deployment of phased-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. The large field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope that will make substantial advances in SKA key science. ASKAP will be located at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, one of the most radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of two sites selected by the international community as a potential location for the SKA.

"Network Structure, Self-Organization and the Growth of International   Collaboration in Science","Caroline S. Wagner, Loet Leydesdorff","Using data from co-authorships at the international level in all fields of science in 1990 and 2000, and within six case studies at the sub-field level in 2000, different explanations for the growth of international collaboration in science and technology are explored. We find that few of the explanations within the literature can be supported by a detailed review of the data. To enable further exploration of the role of recognition and rewards as ordering mechanisms within the system, we apply new tools emerging from network science. These enquiries shows that the growth of international co-authorships can be attributed to self-organizing phenomenon based on preferential attachment (searching for recognition and reward) within networks of co-authors. The co-authorship links can be considered as a complex network with sub-dynamics involving features of both competition and cooperation. The analysis suggests that the growth of international collaboration is more likely to emerge from dynamics at the sub-field level operating in all fields of science, albeit under institutional constraints.

"Measuring impact in research evaluations: A thorough discussion of   methods for, effects of, and problems with impact measurements",Lutz Bornmann,"Impact of science is one of the most important topics in scientometrics. Recent developments show a fundamental change in impact measurements from impact on science to impact on society. Since impact measurement is currently in a state of far reaching changes, this paper describes recent developments and facing problems in this area. For that the results of key publications (dealing with impact measurement) are discussed. The paper discusses how impact is generally measured within science and beyond (section 2), which effects impact measurements have on the science system (section 3), and which problems are associated with impact measurement (section 4). The problems associated with impact measurement constitute the focus of this paper: Science is marked by inequality, random chance, anomalies, the right to make mistakes, unpredictability, and a high significance of extreme events, which might distort impact measurements. Scientometricians as the producer of impact scores and decision makers as their consumers should be aware of these problems and should consider them in the generation and interpretation of bibliometric results, respectively.",2014-10-06T06:31:36Z,2016-02-17T07:44:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1895v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1895v3,"cs.DL, physics.soc-ph"
Cost Preserving Bisimulations for Probabilistic Automata,"Andrea Turrini, Holger Hermanns","Probabilistic automata constitute a versatile and elegant model for concurrent probabilistic systems. They are equipped with a compositional theory supporting abstraction, enabled by weak probabilistic bisimulation serving as the reference notion for summarising the effect of abstraction. This paper considers probabilistic automata augmented with costs. It extends the notions of weak transitions in probabilistic automata in such a way that the costs incurred along a weak transition are captured. This gives rise to cost-preserving and cost-bounding variations of weak probabilistic bisimilarity, for which we establish compositionality properties with respect to parallel composition. Furthermore, polynomial-time decision algorithms are proposed, that can be effectively used to compute reward-bounding abstractions of Markov decision processes in a compositional manner.",2014-10-30T10:26:58Z,2015-02-16T08:54:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8314v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8314v3,"cs.FL, cs.LO"
Nmag micromagnetic simulation tool - software engineering lessons   learned,"Hans Fangohr, Maximilian Albert, Matteo Franchin","We review design and development decisions and their impact for the open source code Nmag from a software engineering in computational science point of view. We summarise lessons learned and recommendations for future computational science projects. Key lessons include that encapsulating the simulation functionality in a library of a general purpose language, here Python, provides great flexibility in using the software. The choice of Python for the top-level user interface was very well received by users from the science and engineering community. The from-source installation in which required external libraries and dependencies are compiled from a tarball was remarkably robust. In places, the code is a lot more ambitious than necessary, which introduces unnecessary complexity and reduces main- tainability. Tests distributed with the package are useful, although more unit tests and continuous integration would have been desirable.

Spherical Planetary Robot for Rugged Terrain Traversal,"Laksh Raura, Andrew Warren, Jekan Thangavelautham","Wheeled planetary rovers such as the Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) have provided unprecedented, detailed images of the Mars surface. However, these rovers are large and are of high-cost as they need to carry sophisticated instruments and science laboratories. We propose the development of low-cost planetary rovers that are the size and shape of cantaloupes and that can be deployed from a larger rover. The rover named SphereX is 2 kg in mass, is spherical, holonomic and contains a hopping mechanism to jump over rugged terrain. A small low-cost rover complements a larger rover, particularly to traverse rugged terrain or roll down a canyon, cliff or crater to obtain images and science data. While it may be a one-way journey for these small robots, they could be used tactically to obtain high-reward science data. The robot is equipped with a pair of stereo cameras to perform visual navigation and has room for a science payload. In this paper, we analyze the design and development of a laboratory prototype.

Credimus,"Edith Hemaspaandra, Lane A.

But for that to happen, experts in on the one hand such areas as social choice, economics, and political science and on the other hand computational complexity will have to better understand each other's worldviews.   This article, written by two complexity theorists who also work in computational social choice theory, focuses on one direction of that process by presenting a brief overview of how most computational complexity theorists view the world. Although our immediate motivation is to make the lens through which complexity theorists see the world be better understood by those in the social sciences, we also feel that even within computer science it is very important for nontheoreticians to understand how theoreticians think, just as it is equally important within computer science for theoreticians to understand how nontheoreticians think.",2017-11-01T04:23:01Z,2019-06-01T17:24:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00201v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00201v2,"cs.CC, cs.GT, cs.MA, F.1.3; I.2.11"
Programs as the Language of Science,Garry Pantelis,"Currently it is widely accepted that the language of science is mathematics. This book explores an alternative idea where the future of science is based on the language of algorithms and programs. How such a language can actually be implemented in the sciences is outlined in some detail. We start by constructing a simple formal system where statements are represented as programs and inference is based on computability as opposed to the classical notion of truth value assignments.   The focus is on theories where the intrinsic properties and dynamic state of real world objects can be defined in terms of information and subject to laws based on simple deterministic rules and finite state arithmetic. Such models, it is argued, not only offer alternative simulation tools, as opposed to those based on discrete approximations of conventional continuum theories, but in themselves can be regarded as a language that describes the physical laws at a fundamental level. This book does not examine any specific application in detail but rather attempts to lay down a foundation for the validation of such theories by employing the inference scheme based on computability logic.",2018-11-13T05:40:45Z,2020-11-05T08:52:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05116v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05116v2,"cs.LO, D.2.4; F.4.1"

Further, using both internal and external measures of complexity, we estimate the effects of complexity as a moderating factor between the democracy-science connection. The results show differential main effects of economic complexity, globalization, and international collaboration on scientific performance, as well as significant interaction effects that moderate the effect of democracy on scientific performance.

Based on the log data we have built interactive visualizations which give an overview and concurrently let us look at the detailed interests of users. The underlying log data and the created visualizations are then used to analyze user interests at different hierarchical levels and on a temporal view. The results show that there are topical interests of the users in specific fields and topics of the social sciences but at the same time there exists a diversity of different information needs.

A critical review of the proposed reforms of the academic performance   indicators applied in the assessment of researchers' performance in Hungary,Gyorgy Csomos,"The academic performance indicators of the Doctor of Science title, the highest and most prestigious qualification awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS), are key in the national assessment system. The types of performance indicators, as well as their minimum values, are incorporated into the application requirements of academic promotions, scientific qualifications, and research scholarships. HAS has proposed a reform of these performance indicators, to align with the current national and global trends. The proposed modifications are generally based on arbitrary decisions and the consensus between academicians, namely, the representatives of the sections of HAS. This paper contains a bibliometric analysis of 25,000 publications produced between 2011 and 2020 by 683 researchers affiliated with HAS's Section of Earth Sciences. The bibliometric data of the publications are processed by integer and fractional counting, respectively. The main goal of the paper is to argue that discipline-specific co-authorship patterns should be accounted for in the assessment procedure. It is also shown that the homogenization of the performance indicators and the rigid use of the integer counting method favour hard natural science disciplines and disadvantage social science disciplines. Finally, I describe some components of an alternative publishing strategy which would be most prudent for researchers, given the proposed assessment criteria.",2021-10-26T07:47:04Z,2021-10-26T07:47:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13459v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13459v1,cs.DL

Understanding and Reducing Crater Counting Errors in Citizen Science   Data and the Need for Standardisation,"P. D. Tar, N. A. Thacker","Citizen science has become a popular tool for preliminary data processing tasks, such as identifying and counting Lunar impact craters in modern high-resolution imagery. However, use of such data requires that citizen science products are understandable and reliable. Contamination and missing data can reduce the usefulness of datasets so it is important that such effects are quantified. This paper presents a method, based upon a newly developed quantitative pattern recognition system (Linear Poisson Models) for estimating levels of contamination within MoonZoo citizen science crater data. Evidence will show that it is possible to remove the effects of contamination, with reference to some agreed upon ground truth, resulting in estimated crater counts which are highly repeatable. However, it will also be shown that correcting for missing data is currently more difficult to achieve. The techniques are tested on MoonZoo citizen science crater annotations from the Apollo 17 site and also undergraduate and expert results from the same region.",2022-09-06T10:54:08Z,2022-09-06T10:54:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02375v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02375v1,"cs.CV, cs.CY"
"Destructive Creation, Creative Destruction, and the Paradox of   Innovation Science","Likun Cao, Ziwen Chen, James Evans","Innovation or the creation and diffusion of new material, social and cultural things in society has been widely studied in sociology and across the social sciences, with investigations sufficiently diverse and dispersed to make them unnavigable. This complexity results from innovation's importance for society, but also the fundamental paradox underlying innovation science: When innovation becomes predictable, it ceases to be an engine of novelty and change. Here we review innovation studies and show that innovations emerge from contexts of discord and disorder, breaches in the structure of prior success, through a process we term destructive creation. This often leads to a complementary process of creative destruction whereby local structures protect and channel the diffusion of successful innovations, rendering alternatives obsolete. We find that social scientists naturally focus far more on how social and cultural contexts influence material innovations than the converse. We highlight computational tools that open new possibilities for the analysis of novel content and context in interaction, and show how this brings us empirically toward the broader range of possibilities that complex systems and science studies have theorized-and science fiction has imagined-the social, cultural and material structures of innovation conditioning each other's change through cycles of disruption and development.",2022-10-18T01:17:43Z,2022-10-18T01:17:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10661v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10661v1,physics.soc-ph

Several authors have considered versions of the intensional group framework where group-specifying properties are articulated using structured terms of a language, such as the language of Boolean algebras or of description logic. In this paper we formulate a general semantic framework for epistemic logics of structured intensional groups, develop the basic theory leading to completeness-via-canonicity results, and show that several frameworks presented in the literature correspond to special cases of the general framework.",2023-07-11T07:06:54Z,2023-07-11T07:06:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05056v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05056v1,"cs.LO, cs.MA"

Character comes from practice: longitudinal practice-based ethics   training in data science,"Louise Bezuidenhout, Emanuele Ratti","In this chapter, we propose a non-traditional RCR training in data science that is grounded into a virtue theory framework. First, we delineate the approach in more theoretical detail, by discussing how the goal of RCR training is to foster the cultivation of certain moral abilities. We specify the nature of these abilities: while the ideal is the cultivation of virtues, the limited space allowed by RCR modules can only facilitate the cultivation of superficial abilities or proto-virtues, which help students to familiarize with moral and political issues in the data science environment. Third, we operationalize our approach by stressing that (proto-)virtue acquisition (like skill acquisition) occurs through the technical and social tasks of daily data science activities, where these repetitive tasks provide the opportunities to develop (proto-)virtue capacity and to support the development of ethically robust data systems. Finally, we discuss a concrete example of how this approach has been implemented.

Evaluating Large Language Models for Structured Science Summarization in   the Open Research Knowledge Graph,"Vladyslav Nechakhin, Jennifer D'Souza, Steffen Eger","Structured science summaries or research contributions using properties or dimensions beyond traditional keywords enhances science findability. Current methods, such as those used by the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), involve manually curating properties to describe research papers' contributions in a structured manner, but this is labor-intensive and inconsistent between the domain expert human curators. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically suggest these properties. However, it's essential to assess the readiness of LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama 2, and Mistral for this task before application. Our study performs a comprehensive comparative analysis between ORKG's manually curated properties and those generated by the aforementioned state-of-the-art LLMs. We evaluate LLM performance through four unique perspectives: semantic alignment and deviation with ORKG properties, fine-grained properties mapping accuracy, SciNCL embeddings-based cosine similarity, and expert surveys comparing manual annotations with LLM outputs. These evaluations occur within a multidisciplinary science setting. Overall, LLMs show potential as recommendation systems for structuring science, but further finetuning is recommended to improve their alignment with scientific tasks and mimicry of human expertise.",2024-05-03T14:03:04Z,2024-05-03T14:03:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02105v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02105v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.IT, math.IT"

Single-Atom Catalysis: An Opportunity For Surface Science,Gareth S. Parkinson,"Over the past decade, extensive research into single-atom catalysts (SACs) has revealed that the catalytic behavior of metal adatoms is highly dependent on how they interact with their support. A strong dependence on the local coordination environment has led to comparisons with metal-organic complexes, and there is growing excitement about the potential to fine-tune SACs by controlling the adsorption geometry. The rise of computational screening to identify the optimal support-metal combinations underscores the need for rigorous benchmarking of theoretical methods, to validate realistic geometries, mechanisms, and the impact of adsorption on stability and catalytic activity. The surface science approach is particularly well-suited for this task because it allows to precisely determine the geometry of the metal atom and interpret its catalytic behavior. Moreover, the effects of temperature and molecular adsorption on the model catalysts stability can be studied in isolation, and conclusions drawn from UHV studies tested in increasingly common near-ambient pressure and electrochemical setups. This perspective highlights recent breakthroughs and specific systems, including metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nitrides, where insights from surface science experiments can significantly advance understanding in this rapidly evolving field.",2025-01-08T14:39:35Z,2025-01-08T14:39:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04539v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04539v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

AtmosSci-Bench: Evaluating the Recent Advance of Large Language Model   for Atmospheric Science,"Chenyue Li, Wen Deng, Mengqian Lu, Binhang Yuan","The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in their reasoning capabilities, hold transformative potential for addressing complex challenges in atmospheric science. However, leveraging LLMs effectively in this domain requires a robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark. To address this need, we present AtmosSci-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. We employ a template-based question generation framework, enabling scalable and diverse multiple-choice questions curated from graduate-level atmospheric science problems. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs, categorized into four groups: instruction-tuned models, advanced reasoning models, math-augmented models, and domain-specific climate models.

Insights from Network Science can advance Deep Graph Learning,"Christopher Blöcker, Martin Rosvall, Ingo Scholtes, Jevin D. West","Deep graph learning and network science both analyze graphs but approach similar problems from different perspectives. Whereas network science focuses on models and measures that reveal the organizational principles of complex systems with explicit assumptions, deep graph learning focuses on flexible and generalizable models that learn patterns in graph data in an automated fashion. Despite these differences, both fields share the same goal: to better model and understand patterns in graph-structured data. Early efforts to integrate methods, models, and measures from network science and deep graph learning indicate significant untapped potential. In this position, we explore opportunities at their intersection. We discuss open challenges in deep graph learning, including data augmentation, improved evaluation practices, higher-order models, and pooling methods. Likewise, we highlight challenges in network science, including scaling to massive graphs, integrating continuous gradient-based optimization, and developing standardized benchmarks.",2025-02-03T09:11:35Z,2025-02-03T09:11:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01177v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01177v1,cs.LG

Scale-free identity: The emergence of social network science,Haiko Lietz,"Social Network Analysis is a way of studying agents embedded in contexts. In about 1998, physicists discovered social networks as representations of complex systems. Small-world and scale-free networks are the paradigmatic models of this Network Science. Relying on various models and mechanisms of socio-cultural processes, an identity model is developed and calibrated in a case study of Social Network Science. This research domain results from the union of Social Network Analysis and Network Science. A unique dataset of 25,760 scholarly articles from one century of research (1916-2012) is created. Clustering this set of publications, five subdomains are detected and analyzed in terms of authorship, citation, and word usage structures and dynamics. The scaling hypothesis of percolation theory is formulated for socio-cultural systems, namely that power-law size distributions like Lotka's, Bradford's, and Zipf's Law mean that the described identity resides at the phase transition between the stability and change of meaning. In this case, it can be diagnosed using bivariate scaling laws and Abbott's heuristic of fractal distinctions. Identities are not dichotomies but dualities of social network and cultural domain, micro and macro phenomena, as well as stability and change. Story sets that give direction to research fluctuate less, are less distinctive, and more inert than the individuals doing the research. Identities are scale-free. Six senses are diagnostic of different aspects of identity, and when they come together as process, a complex socio-cultural system comes into existence. A mutual benefit that results from mating Relational Sociology and Network Science is identified. The latter can learn from the former that social systems are dualities of transactions and meaning. For the social sciences, the importance of Paretian thinking (scale invariance) is pointed out.",2024-03-12T12:28:34Z,2024-03-12T12:28:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07595v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07595v1,physics.soc-ph

After briefly reviewing the current tests of gravitation at Solar System scales, we give motivations to continue such experiments.

A Python-based tool for constructing observables from the DSN's   closed-loop archival tracking data files,Ashok Kumar Verma,"Radio science data collected from NASA's Deep Space Networks (DSNs) are made available in various formats through NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS). The majority of these data are packed in complex formats, making them inaccessible to users without specialized knowledge. In this paper, we present a Python-based tool that can preprocess the closed-loop archival tracking data files (ATDFs), produce Doppler and range observables, and write them in an ASCII table along with ancillary information. ATDFs are primitive closed-loop radio science products with limited available documentation. Early in the 2000s, DSN deprecated ATDF and replaced it with the Tracking and Navigation Service Data Files (TNF) to keep up with the evolution of the radio science system. Most data processing software (e.g., orbit determination software) cannot use them directly, thus limiting the utilization of these data. As such, the vast majority of historical closed-loop radio science data have not yet been processed with modern software and with our improved understanding of the solar system.

EPHS: A Port-Hamiltonian Modelling Language,"Markus Lohmayer, Sigrid Leyendecker",A prevalent theme throughout science and engineering is the ongoing paradigm shift away from isolated systems towards open and interconnected systems. Port-Hamiltonian theory developed as a synthesis of geometric mechanics and network theory. The possibility to model complex multiphysical systems via interconnection of simpler components is often advertised as one of its most attractive features. The development of a port-Hamiltonian modelling language however remains a topic which has not been sufficiently addressed. We report on recent progress towards the formalization and implementation of a modelling language for exergetic port-Hamiltonian systems. Its diagrammatic syntax inspired by bond graphs and its functorial semantics together enable a modular and hierarchical approach to model specification.,2022-02-01T12:35:36Z,2022-04-01T09:19:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00377v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00377v2,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Hysteresis resulting from Lennard-Jones interactions,"Dmitrii Rachinskii, Andrei Zagvozdkin, Oleg Gendelman","The fundamental mechanism of hysteresis in the quasistatic limit of multi-stable systems is associated with transitions of the system from one local minimum of the potential energy to another. In this scenario, as system parameters are (quasistatically) varied, the transition is prompted when a saddle-node bifurcation eliminates the minimum where the system resides in. The objective of the present work is to specify this generic mechanism for systems of interacting particles assuming a natural single-well (Lennard-Jones) interaction potential for each pair of particles. We show multi-stability and present details of hysteresis scenarios with the associated bifurcations and transitions in a case study of constrained four-degrees-of-freedom four particle systems on the plane.",2023-09-17T19:43:10Z,2023-09-17T19:43:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09356v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09356v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, 34C55, 70F40"
Theory of CHTW-systems. Born by Petri Nets,Alexander Yu. Chunikhin,"For the first time, the concept of CHTW-systems as a multidimensional representation of Petri nets, based on the assumption of the spatial distribution of tokens (resources) in positions (branes) and, accordingly, the spatial representation of transitions and arcs is proposed. The theoretical constructs are based on the concept of hybrid functional Petri nets [10]. The introduced concepts of branes and carriers are distant analogies of the corresponding concepts in superstring theory, but the theory of CHTW-systems is neither part of superstring theory nor its development. The description of CHTW-system as a dynamic system for stationary and non-stationary cases is considered.

Encoding impredicative hierarchy of type universes with variables,Yoan Géran,"Logical frameworks can be used to translate proofs from a proof system to another one. For this purpose, we should be able to encode the theory of the proof system in the logical framework. The Lambda Pi calculus modulo theory is one of these logical frameworks. Powerful theories such as pure type systems with an infinite hierarchy of universes have been encoded, leading to partial encodings of proof systems such as Coq, Matita or Agda. In order to fully represent systems such as Coq and Lean, we introduce a representation of an infinite universe hierarchy with an impredicative universe and universe variables where universe equivalence is equality, and implement it as a terminating and confluent rewrite system.",2023-10-25T12:34:01Z,2023-10-25T12:34:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16595v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16595v1,cs.LO

Control Challenges for Resilient Control Systems,Quanyan Zhu,"In this chapter, we introduce methods to address resiliency issues for control systems. The main challenge for control systems is its cyber-physical system nature which strongly couples the cyber systems with physical layer dynamics. Hence the resiliency issues for control systems need to be addressed by integrating the cyber resiliency with the physical layer resiliency. We introduce frameworks that can provide a holistic view of the control system resiliency and a quantitative design paradigm that can enable an optimal cross-layer and cross-stage design at the planning, operation, and recovery stage of control systems. The control systems are often large-scale systems in industrial application and critical infrastructures. Decentralized control of such systems is indispensable.

It is our view that indicator development has suffered from a lack of attention to the theoretical basis for understanding the dynamics of knowledge creation. This lack has been due, in part, to the difficulty of measuring dynamic systems within social organizations.

Challenges of Critical and Emancipatory Design Science Research: The   Design of 'Possible Worlds' as Response,J. Marcel Heusinger,"Popper's (1967) 'piecemeal social change' is an approach manifesting itself in science as critical and emancipatory (C&E) research. It is concerned with incrementally removing manifested inequalities to achieve a 'better' world. Although design science research in information systems seems to be a prime candidate for such endeavors, respective projects are clearly underrepresented. This position paper argues that this is due to the demand of justifying research ex post by an evaluation in practical settings. From the perspective of C&E research it is questionable if powerful actors grant access to their organization and support projects which ultimately challenge their position. It is suggested that theory development based on a synthesis of justificatory knowledge is a complementary approach that allows designing realizable responses to C&E issues---the design of 'possible worlds' (Lewis, 1986) as basis for C&E design science research.",2013-07-12T05:00:37Z,2013-07-12T05:00:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3325v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.3325v1,"cs.CY, cs.HC"

We identify five primary approaches to the study of nature, namely ad hoc formulations, religious approach, pragmatic approach, axiomatic approach and the logic based approach. Each of these approaches have had their prime periods and have contributed significantly to human understanding of nature and have also overlapped within a society. Each approach has had a central role over human evolution at some stage. We surmise that the currently dominant axiomatic method will reach its limits due to complexity of the system and may never be fully formalised.

"""Share and Enjoy"": Publishing Useful and Usable Scientific Models","Tom Crick, Benjamin A.

The retraction of numerous studies from a wide range of disciplines, from climate science to bioscience, has drawn the focus of many commentators, but there exists a wider socio-cultural problem that pervades the scientific community. Sharing code, data and models often requires extra effort; this is currently seen as a significant overhead that may not be worth the time investment.   Automated systems, which allow easy reproduction of results, offer the potential to incentivise a culture change and drive the adoption of new techniques to improve the efficiency of scientific exploration.

Maps of sparse Markov chains efficiently reveal community structure in   network flows with memory,"Christian Persson, Ludvig Bohlin, Daniel Edler, Martin Rosvall","To better understand the flows of ideas or information through social and biological systems, researchers develop maps that reveal important patterns in network flows. In practice, network flow models have implied memoryless first-order Markov chains, but recently researchers have introduced higher-order Markov chain models with memory to capture patterns in multi-step pathways. Higher-order models are particularly important for effectively revealing actual, overlapping community structure, but higher-order Markov chain models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: their vast parameter spaces require exponentially increasing data to avoid overfitting and therefore make mapping inefficient already for moderate-sized systems. To overcome this problem, we introduce an efficient cross-validated mapping approach based on network flows modeled by sparse Markov chains. To illustrate our approach, we present a map of citation flows in science with research fields that overlap in multidisciplinary journals. Compared with currently used categories in science of science studies, the research fields form better units of analysis because the map more effectively captures how ideas flow through science.",2016-06-27T15:48:56Z,2016-06-27T15:48:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08328v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08328v1,"cs.SI, physics.soc-ph"

Algorithmic Auditing and Social Justice: Lessons from the History of   Audit Studies,"Briana Vecchione, Solon Barocas, Karen Levy","Algorithmic audits have been embraced as tools to investigate the functioning and consequences of sociotechnical systems. Though the term is used somewhat loosely in the algorithmic context and encompasses a variety of methods, it maintains a close connection to audit studies in the social sciences--which have, for decades, used experimental methods to measure the prevalence of discrimination across domains like housing and employment. In the social sciences, audit studies originated in a strong tradition of social justice and participatory action, often involving collaboration between researchers and communities; but scholars have argued that, over time, social science audits have become somewhat distanced from these original goals and priorities. We draw from this history in order to highlight difficult tensions that have shaped the development of social science audits, and to assess their implications in the context of algorithmic auditing. In doing so, we put forth considerations to assist in the development of robust and engaged assessments of sociotechnical systems that draw from auditing's roots in racial equity and social justice.",2021-09-14T21:23:11Z,2021-09-14T21:23:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06974v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06974v1,"cs.CY, K.4.0; K.4.1; K.4.2"

We describe our work using Design Thinking to understand the challenges that students face in learning these skills. In the MSc Space Science & Technology at University College Dublin, we have used insights from this process to develop new teaching strategies, including improved assessment rubrics, supported by workshops promoting collaborative programming techniques. We argue that postgraduate level space science courses play a valuable role in developing more advanced computational skills in early-career space scientists.",2022-05-09T16:43:34Z,2022-05-09T16:43:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04416v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04416v1,physics.ed-ph
A BenchCouncil View on Benchmarking Emerging and Future Computing,Jianfeng Zhan,"The measurable properties of the artifacts or objects in the computer, management, or finance disciplines are extrinsic, not inherent -- dependent on their problem definitions and solution instantiations. Only after the instantiation can the solutions to the problem be measured. The processes of definition, instantiation, and measurement are entangled, and they have complex mutual influences. Meanwhile, the technology inertia brings instantiation bias -- trapped into a subspace or even a point at a high-dimension solution space. These daunting challenges, which emerging computing aggravates, make metrology can not work for benchmark communities. It is pressing to establish independent benchmark science and engineering.   This article presents a unifying benchmark definition, a conceptual framework, and a traceable and supervised learning-based benchmarking methodology, laying the foundation for benchmark science and engineering. I also discuss BenchCouncil's plans for emerging and future computing. The ongoing projects include defining the challenges of intelligence, instinct, quantum computers, Metaverse, planet-scale computers, and reformulating data centers, artificial intelligence for science, and CPU benchmark suites. Also, BenchCouncil will collaborate with ComputerCouncil on open-source computer systems for planet-scale computing, AI for science systems, and Metaverse.",2022-05-16T15:47:59Z,2022-05-16T15:47:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07769v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07769v1,"cs.ET, cs.PF"

AI-Assisted Discovery of Quantitative and Formal Models in Social   Science,"Julia Balla, Sihao Huang, Owen Dugan, Rumen Dangovski, Marin Soljacic","In social science, formal and quantitative models, such as ones describing economic growth and collective action, are used to formulate mechanistic explanations, provide predictions, and uncover questions about observed phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the use of a machine learning system to aid the discovery of symbolic models that capture nonlinear and dynamical relationships in social science datasets. By extending neuro-symbolic methods to find compact functions and differential equations in noisy and longitudinal data, we show that our system can be used to discover interpretable models from real-world data in economics and sociology. Augmenting existing workflows with symbolic regression can help uncover novel relationships and explore counterfactual models during the scientific process.

A Declarative Query Language for Scientific Machine Learning,Hasan M Jamil,"The popularity of data science as a discipline and its importance in the emerging economy and industrial progress dictate that machine learning be democratized for the masses. This also means that the current practice of workforce training using machine learning tools, which requires low-level statistical and algorithmic details, is a barrier that needs to be addressed. Similar to data management languages such as SQL, machine learning needs to be practiced at a conceptual level to help make it a staple tool for general users. In particular, the technical sophistication demanded by existing machine learning frameworks is prohibitive for many scientists who are not computationally savvy or well versed in machine learning techniques. The learning curve to use the needed machine learning tools is also too high for them to take advantage of these powerful platforms to rapidly advance science. In this paper, we introduce a new declarative machine learning query language, called {\em MQL}, for naive users. We discuss its merit and possible ways of implementing it over a traditional relational database system. We discuss two materials science experiments implemented using MQL on a materials science workflow system called MatFlow.",2024-05-25T09:58:33Z,2024-05-25T09:58:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16159v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16159v1,"cs.LG, cs.DB"
"Homeopathic Modernization and the Middle Science Trap: conceptual   context of ergonomics, econometrics and logic of some national scientific   case",Eldar Knar,"This article analyses the structural and institutional barriers hindering the development of scientific systems in transition economies, such as Kazakhstan. The main focus is on the concept of the ""middle science trap,"" which is characterized by steady growth in quantitative indicators (publications, grants) but a lack of qualitative advancement. Excessive bureaucracy, weak integration into the international scientific community, and ineffective science management are key factors limiting development. This paper proposes an approach of ""homeopathic modernization,"" which focuses on minimal yet strategically significant changes aimed at reducing bureaucratic barriers and enhancing the effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem. A comparative analysis of international experience (China, India, and the European Union) is provided, demonstrating how targeted reforms in the scientific sector can lead to significant results.

Assessing the Robustness and Resilience of U.S. Strategic Highways: A   Network Science Perspective,"Sukhwan Chung, Daniel Sardak, Jeffrey Cegan, Igor Linkov","Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing transportation networks, offering insights into their structures and enabling the quantification of resilience and robustness. Understanding the underlying structures of transportation networks is crucial for effective infrastructure planning and maintenance. In military contexts, network science is valuable for analyzing logistics networks, critical for the movement and supply of troops and equipment. The U.S. Army's logistical success, particularly in the ""fort-to-port"" phase, relies heavily on the Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) in the U.S., which is a system of public highways crucial for military deployments. However, the shared nature of these networks with civilian users introduces unique challenges, including vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and physical sabotage, which is highlighted by the concept of contested logistics. This paper proposes a method using network science and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the robustness and resilience of transportation networks, specifically applied to military logistics. Our findings indicate that while the STRAHNET is robust against targeted disruptions, it is more resilient to random disruptions.",2024-12-15T13:45:11Z,2024-12-15T13:45:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11188v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11188v1,physics.soc-ph
The Science of Urban Metabolism and Sustainability,"Mariana Brüning-González, José Ignacio Arroyo, Pablo A.

While many fields have been studied from this perspective, Urban Science (USc) and its subfields remain underexplored. As organisms, urban systems rely on materials and energy inputs and transformation (i.e. metabolism) to sustain essential dynamics. This concept has been adopted by various disciplines, including architecture and sociology, and by those focused on metabolic processes, such as ecology and industrial ecology. This study addresses the structure and evolution of Urban Metabolism (UM) and Sustainability research, analyzing articles by disciplines, study subjects (e.g., cities, regions), methodologies, and author diversity (nationality and gender). Our review suggests that UM is an emerging field that grew until 2019, primarily addressed by environmental science and ecology. Common methods include Ecological Network Analysis, and Life Cycle Assessment, and Material Flow Analysis, focusing flows over stocks, ecosystem dynamics and evolutionary perspectives of the urban system. Authors are predominantly from China and the USA, and there are less gender gaps compared to general science research.

"The Universal Arrow of Time V-VI: (Part V) Unpredictable dynamics (Part   VI) Future of artificial intelligence - Art, not Science: Practical   Application of Unpredictable Systems",Oleg Kupervasser,"The paper consists of the two independent papers:(Part V) We see that exact equations of quantum and classical mechanics describe ideal dynamics which is reversible and leads to Poincare's returns. Real equations of physics describing observable dynamics, for example, hydrodynamic equations of viscous fluid, are irreversible and exclude Poincare's returns to the initial state. Besides, these equations describe systems in terms of macroparameters or phase distribution functions of microparameters. For many systems introduction of macroparameters that allow exhaustive describing of dynamics of the system is impossible. Their dynamics becomes unpredictable in principle, sometimes even unpredictable by the probabilistic way. We will refer to dynamics describing such system as unpredictable dynamics. Dynamics of unpredictable systems is not described and not predicted by scientific methods. Thus, the science itself puts boundaries for its applicability. But such systems can intuitively ""understand itself"" and ""predict"" the behavior ""of its own"" or even ""communicate with each other"" at intuitive level.

Structural Control Analysis of System Dynamics Models,Tianyi Li,"Structural control theory could be applied to study the control principles of social, economic and managerial systems. System Dynamics (SD) is the target field in social-economic sciences for endogenizing this theory, a subject that provides modeling solutions to real-world problems. SD models adopt diagrammatic representations, making it an ideal ground for transplanting structural control theory which utilizes similar graphic representations. This study sets up the theoretical ground for conducting structural control analysis (SCA) on SD models, summarized as a post-modeling workflow for SD practitioners, which serves as a specific application of the general structural control theory in social-economic sciences. Theoretical and practical establishments for SCA components are developed coordinately. Specifically, this study addresses the following questions: (1) How do SD models differ from physical control systems in graphic representations, and how do these differences affect the way of applying structural control theories to SD? (2) How could one identify control inputs in SD models, and how could different levels of system control in SD models be conceptualized? (3) What are the structural control properties for important SD components, and how could these properties and control principles help justify modeling heuristics in SD practice? (4) What are the procedures for conducting Structural Control Analysis (SCA) in SD models, and what are the implications of SCA results for model calibration and decision making? Overall, this study provides general insights for system control analysis of nonlinear dynamic simulation models, which may go beyond SD and extend to various disciplines in social-economic sciences.",2020-05-27T06:02:53Z,2020-05-27T06:02:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13179v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13179v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Yet due to the nonlinear feedbacks, strategic interactions and complex structure of the Earth system, the understanding and in particular the predicting of such disruptive events represent formidable challenges for both scientific and policy communities. During the past years, the emergence and evolution of Earth system science has attracted much attention and produced new concepts and frameworks. Especially, novel statistical physics and complex networks-based techniques have been developed and implemented to substantially advance our knowledge for a better understanding of the Earth system, including climate extreme events, earthquakes and Earth geometric relief features, leading to substantially improved predictive performances. We present here a comprehensive review on the recent scientific progress in the development and application of how combined statistical physics and complex systems science approaches such as, critical phenomena, network theory, percolation, tipping points analysis, as well as entropy can be applied to complex Earth systems (climate, earthquakes, etc.).

A Unified System for Data Analytics and In Situ Query Processing,"Alex Watson, Suvam Kumar Das, Suprio Ray","In today's world data is being generated at a high rate due to which it has become inevitable to analyze and quickly get results from this data. Most of the relational databases primarily support SQL querying with a limited support for complex data analysis. Due to this reason, data scientists have no other option, but to use a different system for complex data analysis. Due to this, data science frameworks are in huge demand. But to use such a framework, all the data needs to be loaded into it. This requires significant data movement across multiple systems, which can be expensive.   We believe that it has become the need of the hour to come up with a single system which can perform both data analysis tasks and SQL querying. This will save the data scientists from the expensive data transfer operation across systems. In our work, we present DaskDB, a system built over the Python's Dask framework, which is a scalable data science system having support for both data analytics and in situ SQL query processing over heterogeneous data sources. DaskDB supports invoking any Python APIs as User-Defined Functions (UDF) over SQL queries. So, it can be easily integrated with most existing Python data science applications, without modifying the existing code. Since joining two relations is a very vital but expensive operation, so a novel distributed learned index is also introduced to improve the join performance. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DaskDB significantly outperforms existing systems.",2021-02-18T12:16:20Z,2021-04-07T14:55:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09295v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09295v2,cs.DB
Zenith-Distance Dependence of Chromatic Shear Effect: A Limiting Factor   for an Extreme Adaptive Optics System,Tadashi Nakajima,"Consider a perfect AO system with a very fine wavefront sampling interval and a very small actuator interval. If this AO system senses wavefront at a wavelength, lambda_{WFS}, and does science imaging at another wavelength, lambda_{SCI}, the light paths through the turbulent atmosphere at these two wavelengths are slightly different for a finite zenith distance, z. The error in wavefront reconstruction of the science channel associated with this non-common path effect, or so-called chromatic shear, is uncorrectable and sets an upper bound of the system performance. We evaluate the wavefront variance, sigma^2(lambda_{WFS},lambda_{SCI},z) for a typical seeing condition at Mauna Kea and find that this effect is not negligible at a large z. If we require that the Strehl ratio be greater than 99 or 95%, z must be less than about 50 or 60 deg respectively, for the combination of visible wavefront sensing and infrared science imaging.",2006-08-17T23:35:16Z,2006-08-17T23:35:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608388v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0608388v1,astro-ph

Antiferroelectric and ferroelectric order parameters (which correspond respectively to the difference and sum of two sublattices ions shifts) were introduced for antiferroelectric host lattice. Small admixture of ferroelectric component was considered as a random electric field source. The influence of this field on both aforementioned order parameters was calculated. Self consistent averaging with calculated random field distribution function made it possible to obtain the system of equations for order parameters of mixed system. The antiferroelectric $T_a$ and ferroelectric $T_c$ phase transition temperature concentrational dependence was expressed through the transition temperatures of the composition and members.

Tight-Binding Linear Scaling Method Applications to Silicon Surfaces,"Abduxukur Abdurixit, Alexis Baratoff, Giulia Galli","The past years have witnessed impressive advances in electronic structure calculation, especially in the complexity and size of the systems studied, as well as in computation time. Linear scaling methods based on empirical tight-binding Hamiltonians which can describe chemical bonding, and have a computational time proportional to the number of atoms N in the system, are of particular interest for simulations in material science. By contrast conventional diagonalization schemes scale as $N^{3}$. In combination with judiciously fitted parameters and an implementation suited for MD, it is possible to apply such \emph{O(N)} methods to structural, electronic and dynamical properties of large systems which include up to 1000 atoms on a workstation.

Linear Logic by Levels and Bounded Time Complexity,"Patrick Baillot, Damiano Mazza","We give a new characterization of elementary and deterministic polynomial time computation in linear logic through the proofs-as-programs correspondence. Girard's seminal results, concerning elementary and light linear logic, achieve this characterization by enforcing a stratification principle on proofs, using the notion of depth in proof nets. Here, we propose a more general form of stratification, based on inducing levels in proof nets by means of indexes, which allows us to extend Girard's systems while keeping the same complexity properties. In particular, it turns out that Girard's systems can be recovered by forcing depth and level to coincide. A consequence of the higher flexibility of levels with respect to depth is the absence of boxes for handling the paragraph modality. We use this fact to propose a variant of our polytime system in which the paragraph modality is only allowed on atoms, and which may thus serve as a basis for developing lambda-calculus type assignment systems with more efficient typing algorithms than existing ones.",2008-01-08T15:08:20Z,2009-07-26T13:07:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1253v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.1253v3,"cs.LO, cs.CC"
O-Minimal Hybrid Reachability Games,"Patricia Bouyer, Thomas Brihaye, Fabrice Chevalier","In this paper, we consider reachability games over general hybrid systems, and distinguish between two possible observation frameworks for those games: either the precise dynamics of the system is seen by the players (this is the perfect observation framework), or only the starting point and the delays are known by the players (this is the partial observation framework). In the first more classical framework, we show that time-abstract bisimulation is not adequate for solving this problem, although it is sufficient in the case of timed automata . That is why we consider an other equivalence, namely the suffix equivalence based on the encoding of trajectories through words. We show that this suffix equivalence is in general a correct abstraction for games. We apply this result to o-minimal hybrid systems, and get decidability and computability results in this framework. For the second framework which assumes a partial observation of the dynamics of the system, we propose another abstraction, called the superword encoding, which is suitable to solve the games under that assumption. In that framework, we also provide decidability and computability results.",2009-11-25T12:33:37Z,2010-01-12T21:41:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4833v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.4833v2,"cs.LO, cs.GT, F.3.1; F.4.1"

As to be expected, games have become an increasingly important modeling tool wherever nondeterministic interactions are involved -- from foundations in game semantics and reactive systems to applications in communication protocols and electronic business applications. The goal of this workshop has been to bring researchers from industry and academia together and to explore how a better understanding of the interrelation between interactions, games and protocols leads to better-designed and more reliable nondeterministic interacting systems.   iWIGP 2011 was collocated with ETAPS 2011 in Saarbruecken, Germany.

In the example of biotech research in China, we found dynamic changes in center-periphery patterns. These results are based on a network analysis of evolving co-authorship networks from 2001 to 2009 that were built combining national and international databases. Therefore, our results are not only relevant for evaluating the spatial structure and dynamics in the Chinese biotech system and its integration into the global knowledge network, but also revive a discussion on persistence and processes of change in the systems theory for sciencebased industries.",2011-12-12T10:22:46Z,2011-12-12T10:22:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2498v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.2498v1,"physics.soc-ph, 05C21, 90C35"
On Reverse Engineering in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences,Andreas Schierwagen,"Various research initiatives try to utilize the operational principles of organisms and brains to develop alternative, biologically inspired computing paradigms and artificial cognitive systems. This paper reviews key features of the standard method applied to complexity in the cognitive and brain sciences, i.e. decompositional analysis or reverse engineering. The indisputable complexity of brain and mind raise the issue of whether they can be understood by applying the standard method. Actually, recent findings in the experimental and theoretical fields, question central assumptions and hypotheses made for reverse engineering. Using the modeling relation as analyzed by Robert Rosen, the scientific analysis method itself is made a subject of discussion. It is concluded that the fundamental assumption of cognitive science, i.e. complex cognitive systems can be analyzed, understood and duplicated by reverse engineering, must be abandoned. Implications for investigations of organisms and behavior as well as for engineering artificial cognitive systems are discussed.",2012-01-23T23:35:06Z,2012-01-23T23:35:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4896v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4896v1,"nlin.AO, q-bio.NC"
A Semi-Structured Tailoring-Driven Approach for ERP Selection,"Abdelilah Khaled, Mohammed Abdou Janati Idrissi","It has been widely reported that selecting an inappropriate system is a major reason for ERP implementation failures. The selection of an ERP system is therefore critical. While the number of papers related to ERP implementation is substantial, ERP evaluation and selection approaches have received few attention. Motivated by the adaptation concept of the ERP systems, we propose in this paper a semi-structured approach for ERP system selection that differs from existing models in that it has a more holistic focus by simultaneously 1) considering the anticipated fitness of ERP solutions after the optimal resolution, within limited resources, of a set of the identified mismatches and 2) evaluating candidate products according to both functional and non-functional requirements. The approach consists of an iterative selection process model and an evaluation methodology based on 0-1 linear programming and MACBETH technique to elaborate multi-criteria performance expressions.",2012-11-11T18:03:51Z,2012-11-11T18:03:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2445v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.2445v1,"cs.OH, H.3.4; C.4; D.2.1; D.2.2; D.2.8; D.2.9; D.2.10; G.1.1; G.1.3; G.1.6"

Verifying Web Applications: From Business Level Specifications to   Automated Model-Based Testing,"Christian Colombo, Mark Micallef, Mark Scerri","One of reasons preventing a wider uptake of model-based testing in the industry is the difficulty which is encountered by developers when trying to think in terms of properties rather than linear specifications. A disparity has traditionally been perceived between the language spoken by customers who specify the system and the language required to construct models of that system. The dynamic nature of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would need to be rechecked after every specification change. In this paper, we propose an approach for converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models for use with a model-based testing tool. We have instantiated this approach using QuickCheck and demonstrate its applicability via a case study on the eHealth system, the national health portal for Maltese residents.",2014-03-28T01:04:29Z,2014-03-28T01:04:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7258v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.7258v1,"cs.SE, D.2.4; D.2.5"

The Natural Science Underlying Big History,Eric J. Chaisson,"Nature's many varied complex systems (including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society) are islands of order within the increasingly disordered universe. All organized systems are subject to physical, biological or cultural evolution, which together comprise the grander interdisciplinary subject of cosmic evolution. This is global history greatly extended, big history with a scientific basis, and natural history broadly portrayed across 14 billion years of time. Such evolution writ large has significant potential to unify the natural sciences into a holistic understanding of who we are and whence we came. No new science (beyond frontier, non-equilibrium thermodynamics) is needed to describe cosmic evolution's major milestones at a deep and empirical level. Quantitative models and experimental tests imply that a remarkable simplicity underlies the emergence and growth of complexity for a wide spectrum of known and diverse systems. In particular, energy rate density is an objective metric suitable to gauge relative degrees of complexity along a hierarchy of widely assorted systems observed throughout the material universe.",2014-06-10T21:58:41Z,2014-06-10T21:58:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2730v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2730v1,"physics.pop-ph, astro-ph.CO, q-bio.OT"
Using Python to Dive into Signalling Data with CellNOpt and BioServices,"Thomas Cokelaer, Julio Saez-Rodriguez","Systems biology is an inter-disciplinary field that studies systems of biological components at different scales, which may be molecules, cells or entire organism. In particular, systems biology methods are applied to understand functional deregulations within human cells (e.g., cancers). In this context, we present several python packages linked to CellNOptR (R package), which is used to build predictive logic models of signalling networks by training networks (derived from literature) to signalling (phospho-proteomic) data. The first package (cellnopt.wrapper) is a wrapper based on RPY2 that allows a full access to CellNOptR functionalities within Python. The second one (cellnopt.core) was designed to ease the manipulation and visualisation of data structures used in CellNOptR, which was achieved by using Pandas, NetworkX and matplotlib. Systems biology also makes extensive use of web resources and services. We will give an overview and status of BioServices, which allows one to access programmatically to web resources used in life science and how it can be combined with CellNOptR.",2014-12-19T15:43:09Z,2014-12-19T15:43:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6386v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6386v1,"cs.CE, q-bio.MN"

We can let such bots participate in a reputation system together with human users, meaning that bots and humans get positive or negative feedback by other participants. Positive reputation given to these bots would also shine on their owners, motivating them to contribute to this system, while negative reputation will allow us to filter out low-quality data, which is inevitable in an open and decentralized system.",2015-03-15T02:45:21Z,2015-03-15T02:45:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04374v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04374v1,"cs.CY, cs.DL, cs.MA, K.4.2"

Rules may be non-terminating, non-left-linear, or non-right-linear.

ProvDB: A System for Lifecycle Management of Collaborative Analysis   Workflows,"Hui Miao, Amit Chavan, Amol Deshpande","As data-driven methods are becoming pervasive in a wide variety of disciplines, there is an urgent need to develop scalable and sustainable tools to simplify the process of data science, to make it easier to keep track of the analyses being performed and datasets being generated, and to enable introspection of the workflows. In this paper, we describe our vision of a unified provenance and metadata management system to support lifecycle management of complex collaborative data science workflows. We argue that a large amount of information about the analysis processes and data artifacts can, and should be, captured in a semi-passive manner; and we show that querying and analyzing this information can not only simplify bookkeeping and debugging tasks for data analysts but can also enable a rich new set of capabilities like identifying flaws in the data science process itself. It can also significantly reduce the time spent in fixing post-deployment problems through automated analysis and monitoring.

A Supervisory Control Algorithm Based on Property-Directed Reachability,"Koen Claessen, Jonatan Kilhamn, Laura Kovács, Bengt Lennartson","We present an algorithm for synthesising a controller (supervisor) for a discrete event system (DES) based on the property-directed reachability (PDR) model checking algorithm. The discrete event systems framework is useful in both software, automation and manufacturing, as problems from those domains can be modelled as discrete supervisory control problems. As a formal framework, DES is also similar to domains for which the field of formal methods for computer science has developed techniques and tools. In this paper, we attempt to marry the two by adapting PDR to the problem of controller synthesis. The resulting algorithm takes as input a transition system with forbidden states and uncontrollable transitions, and synthesises a safe and minimally-restrictive controller, correct-by-design. We also present an implementation along with experimental results, showing that the algorithm has potential as a part of the solution to the greater effort of formal supervisory controller synthesis and verification.",2017-11-17T11:36:01Z,2017-11-17T11:36:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06501v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06501v1,"cs.SY, cs.LO, 68-02"

Simulating Public Administration Crisis: A Novel Generative Agent-Based   Simulation System to Lower Technology Barriers in Social Science Research,"Bushi Xiao, Ziyuan Yin, Zixuan Shan","This article proposes a social simulation paradigm based on the GPT-3.5 large language model. It involves constructing Generative Agents that emulate human cognition, memory, and decision-making frameworks, along with establishing a virtual social system capable of stable operation and an insertion mechanism for standardized public events. The project focuses on simulating a township water pollution incident, enabling the comprehensive examination of a virtual government's response to a specific public administration event. Controlled variable experiments demonstrate that the stored memory in generative agents significantly influences both individual decision-making and social networks.   The Generative Agent-Based Simulation System introduces a novel approach to social science and public administration research. Agents exhibit personalized customization, and public events are seamlessly incorporated through natural language processing. Its high flexibility and extensive social interaction render it highly applicable in social science investigations. The system effectively reduces the complexity associated with building intricate social simulations while enhancing its interpretability.",2023-11-12T20:48:01Z,2023-11-12T20:48:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06957v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06957v1,cs.CY
Beam Operation for Particle Physics and Photon Science with   Pulse-to-Pulse Modulation at KEK injector LINAC,"Kazuro Furukawa, Masanori Satoh, Injector LINAC group","The electron and positron accelerator complex at KEK offers unique experimental opportunities in the fields of elementary particle physics with SuperKEKB collider and photon science with two light sources. In order to maximize the experimental performances at those facilities the injector LINAC employs pulse-to-pulse modulation at 50 Hz, injecting beams with diverse properties. The event-based control system effectively manages different beam configurations. This injection scheme was initially designed 15 years ago and has been in full operation since 2019. Over the years, quite a few enhancements have been implemented. As the event-based controls are tightly coupled with microwave systems, machine protection systems and so on, their modifications require meticulous planning. However, the diverse requirements from particle physics and photon science, stemming from the distinct nature of those experiments, often necessitate patient negotiation to meet the demands of both fields. This presentation discusses those operational aspects of the multidisciplinary facility.",2023-12-05T02:42:38Z,2023-12-05T02:42:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02440v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02440v1,physics.acc-ph
Efficient Probabilistic Modeling of Crystallization at Mesoscopic Scale,"Pol Timmer, Koen Minartz, Vlado Menkovski","Crystallization processes at the mesoscopic scale, where faceted, dendritic growth, and multigrain formation can be observed, are of particular interest within materials science and metallurgy. These processes are highly nonlinear, stochastic, and sensitive to small perturbations of system parameters and initial conditions. Methods for the simulation of these processes have been developed using discrete numerical models, but these are computationally expensive. This work aims to scale crystal growth simulation with a machine learning emulator. Specifically, autoregressive latent variable models are well suited for modeling the joint distribution over system parameters and the crystallization trajectories. However, successfully training such models is challenging due to the stochasticity and sensitivity of the system. Existing approaches consequently fail to produce diverse and faithful crystallization trajectories. In this paper, we introduce the Crystal Growth Neural Emulator (CGNE), a probabilistic model for efficient crystal growth emulation at the mesoscopic scale that overcomes these challenges. We validate CGNE results using the morphological properties of the crystals produced by numerical simulation. CGNE delivers a factor of 11 improvement in inference time and performance gains compared with recent state-of-the-art probabilistic models for dynamical systems.",2024-05-26T15:37:19Z,2024-05-26T15:37:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16608v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16608v1,"cs.LG, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
First results from a low cost software defined radio system monitoring   VHF equatorial ionospheric scintillations in the Indian sector,Jishnu N. Thekkeppattu,"Scintillations of radio frequency signals due to the ionosphere, despite having been studied for decades, is still an active area of research. Of particular interest is the scintillations near the geomagnetic equator, where such scintillations can be strong enough to cause disruptions to satellite communications. In this paper, a low cost system to monitor VHF scintillations is described. The system called the Personal Ionospheric Experiment (PIE) makes use of a widely available software defined radio (SDR) to perform the measurements. The use of an SDR vastly enhances the flexibility, especially in environments with non-negligible radio frequency interference (RFI). A simple technique to effectively subtract out transient RFI commonly found in radio data is detailed, and tested with data collected over several months. The utility of the proposed system is demonstrated with the analysis of a night-time scintillation patch; a few daytime scintillations are also reported. Therefore this paper demonstrates the feasibility of conducting useful low-cost radio science experiments in semi-urban locations with RFI, encouraging similar citizen science initiatives.",2024-09-12T05:23:40Z,2024-09-12T05:23:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07758v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07758v1,"physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, physics.space-ph"

Multilevel compression of random walks on networks reveals hierarchical   organization in large integrated systems,"M. Rosvall, C. T. Bergstrom","To comprehend the hierarchical organization of large integrated systems, we introduce the hierarchical map equation, which reveals multilevel structures in networks. In this information-theoretic approach, we exploit the duality between compression and pattern detection; by compressing a description of a random walker as a proxy for real flow on a network, we find regularities in the network that induce this system-wide flow. Finding the shortest multilevel description of the random walker therefore gives us the best hierarchical clustering of the network, the optimal number of levels and modular partition at each level, with respect to the dynamics on the network. With a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel organization of several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical structures in globally interconnected systems, such as neural networks, and rich multilevel organizations in systems with highly separated regions, such as road networks.",2010-10-03T19:10:16Z,2011-04-10T06:40:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0431v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.0431v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI, physics.comp-ph"

The framework of networks has led to significant advances in the understanding of the structure, formation and function of complex systems. Social and biological processes such as the dynamics of epidemics, the diffusion of information in social media, the interactions between species in ecosystems or the communication between neurons in our brains are all actively studied using dynamical models on complex networks. In all of these systems, the patterns of connections at the individual level play a fundamental role on the global dynamics and finding the most important nodes allows one to better understand and predict their behaviors. An important research effort in network science has therefore been dedicated to the development of methods allowing to find the most important nodes in networks.

Commensurate and Incommensurate Phases of a Spin-Peierls System,J. Srivatsava,"The interest in the study of spin-Peierls phenomenon has increased with the discovery of copper germanium oxide (CuGeO_3) as an example of spin-Peierls systems. The availability of this inorganic compound as large, high quality single crystals, allow experimental measurements which aid in understanding the spin-Peierls phenomenon. This report details the numerical and analytical work done on the various magnetic phases that occur in a quasi-one-dimensional spin-Peierls system (like that of copper germanium oxide). Taking the system to be finite, the bond displacements, single particle energies, energy eigenfunctions, spin densities and phonon frequencies are calculated numerically for all possible magnetizations, which includes both the commensurate and incommensurate phases, at zero temperature. Solitons of fractional spin are found to be present in the system for appropriate magnetizations. The uniform to dimerized phase transition occurring in this system is also modelled numerically. The single particle and ground-state energies are later obtained theoretically for the uniform and dimerized phases. In addition, the lattice spin displacements are analytically modelled for a particular magnetization of the system.",2001-10-22T06:11:06Z,2001-10-22T06:11:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0110446v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0110446v1,"cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.stat-mech"
Quantum Multi-Prover Interactive Proof Systems with Limited Prior   Entanglement,"Hirotada Kobayashi, Keiji Matsumoto","This paper gives the first formal treatment of a quantum analogue of multi-prover interactive proof systems. It is proved that the class of languages having quantum multi-prover interactive proof systems is necessarily contained in NEXP, under the assumption that provers are allowed to share at most polynomially many prior-entangled qubits. This implies that, in particular, if provers do not share any prior entanglement with each other, the class of languages having quantum multi-prover interactive proof systems is equal to NEXP.

Entropy production of diffusion in spatially periodic deterministic   systems,"J. R. Dorfman, P. Gaspard, T. Gilbert","This paper presents an {\it ab initio} derivation of the expression given by irreversible thermodynamics for the rate of entropy production for different classes of diffusive processes. The first class are Lorentz gases, where non-interacting particles move on a spatially periodic lattice, and collide elastically with fixed scatterers. The second class are periodic systems where $N$ particles interact with each other, and one of them is a tracer particle which diffuses among the cells of the lattice. We assume that, in either case, the dynamics of the system is deterministic and hyperbolic, with positive Lyapunov exponents. This work extends methods originally developed for a chaotic two-dimensional model of diffusion, the multi-baker map, to higher dimensional, continuous time dynamical systems appropriate for systems with one or more moving particles. Here we express the rate of entropy production in terms of hydrodynamic measures that are determined by the fractal properties of microscopic hydrodynamic modes that describe the slowest decay of the system to an equilibrium state.",2002-03-21T19:47:56Z,2002-03-21T19:47:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0203046v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0203046v1,"nlin.CD, cond-mat.stat-mech"

The scheduling algorithm plays a significant role in the design of real time embedded systems. Simple round robin architecture is not efficient to be implemented in embedded systems because of higher context switch rate, larger waiting time and larger response time. Missing of deadlines will degrade the system performance in soft real time systems. The main objective of this paper is to develop the scheduling algorithm which removes the drawbacks in simple round robin architecture.

SAT solving procedures are described as transition relations over states that represent the values of the solver's global variables. Several different SAT solvers are formalized, including both the classical DPLL procedure and its state-of-the-art successors. The formalization is made within the Isabelle/HOL system and the total correctness (soundness, termination, completeness) is shown for each presented system (with respect to a simple notion of satisfiability that can be manually checked). The systems are defined in a general way and cover procedures used in a wide range of modern SAT solvers. Our formalization builds up on the previous work on state transition systems for SAT, but it gives machine-verifiable proofs, somewhat more general specifications, and weaker assumptions that ensure the key correctness properties.

Synthesizing SystemC Code from Delay Hybrid CSP,"Gaogao Yan, Li Jiao, Shuling Wang, Naijun Zhan","Delay is omnipresent in modern control systems, which can prompt oscillations and may cause deterioration of control performance, invalidate both stability and safety properties. This implies that safety or stability certificates obtained on idealized, delay-free models of systems prone to delayed coupling may be erratic, and further the incorrectness of the executable code generated from these models. However, automated methods for system verification and code generation that ought to address models of system dynamics reflecting delays have not been paid enough attention yet in the computer science community. In our previous work, on one hand, we investigated the verification of delay dynamical and hybrid systems; on the other hand, we also addressed how to synthesize SystemC code from a verified hybrid system modelled by Hybrid CSP (HCSP) without delay. In this paper, we give a first attempt to synthesize SystemC code from a verified delay hybrid system modelled by Delay HCSP (dHCSP), which is an extension of HCSP by replacing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with delay differential equations (DDEs).

We introduce the first uniform framework for timed behavioural models that encompasses known behavioural equivalences such as timed bisimulations, timed language equivalences as well as their weak and time-abstract counterparts. All these notions of equivalences are naturally organised by their discriminating power in a spectrum. We prove that this result does not depend on the type of the systems under scrutiny: it holds for any generalisation of timed transition system.

We also show, under basic assumptions, that interpreting lambda abstractions via a monoidal closed structure (a popular method for linear type systems) necessarily leads to degenerate and inadequate models for call-by-value affine type systems with recursion. In our categorical treatment, a solution to this problem is clearly presented. Our categorical models are more general than linear/non-linear models used to study linear logic and we present a homogeneous categorical account of both linear and affine type systems in a call-by-value setting.

Experimental observation of a phase transition in the evolution of   many-body systems with dipolar interactions,"Gonzalo A. Alvarez, Dieter Suter, Robin Kaiser","Non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body systems is important in many branches of science, such as condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and ultracold atoms. Here we report the experimental observation of a phase transition of the quantum coherent dynamics of a 3D many-spin system with dipolar interactions, and determine its critical exponents. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a solid-state system of spins at room-temperature, we quench the interaction Hamiltonian to drive the evolution of the system. The resulting dynamics of the system coherence can be localized or extended, depending on the quench strength. Applying a finite-time scaling analysis to the observed time-evolution of the number of correlated spins, we extract the critical exponents v = s = 0.42 around the phase transition separating a localized from a delocalized dynamical regime. These results show clearly that such nuclear-spin based quantum simulations can effectively model the non-equilibrium dynamics of complex many-body systems, such as 3D spin-networks with dipolar interactions.",2014-09-16T10:08:32Z,2014-09-16T10:08:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4562v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4562v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall"
Proceedings 2nd Workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems,"Holger Hermanns, Peter Höfner","This volume contains the proceedings of MARS 2017, the second workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems, held on April 29, 2017 in Uppala, Sweden, as an affiliated workshop of ETAPS 2017, the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software.   The workshop emphasises modelling over verification. It aims at discussing the lessons learned from making formal methods for the verification and analysis of realistic systems. Examples are:   (1) Which formalism is chosen, and why?   (2) Which abstractions have to be made and why?   (3) How are important characteristics of the system modelled?   (4) Were there any complications while modelling the system?   (5) Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?   We invited papers that present full models of real systems, which may lay the basis for future comparison and analysis. An aim of the workshop is to present different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them. Alternative formal descriptions of the systems presented at this workshop are encouraged, which should foster the development of improved specification formalisms.",2017-03-15T07:16:39Z,2017-03-15T07:16:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05812v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05812v1,"cs.LO, cs.CE, cs.FL"
On the Scaling and Spacing of Extra-Solar Multi-Planet Systems,"Li-Chin Yeh, Ing-Guey Jiang, Sridhar Gajendran","We investigate whether certain extra-solar multi-planet systems simultaneously follow the scaling and spacing rules of the angular-momentum-deficit model. The masses and semi-major axes of exoplanets in ten multi-planet systems are considered. It is found that GJ 667C, HD 215152, HD 40307, and Kepler-79 systems are currently close to configurations of the angular-momentum-deficit model. In a gas-poor scenario, GJ 3293, HD 141399, and HD 34445 systems are those which had a configuration of the angular-momentum-deficit model in the past and get scattered away due to post gaseous effects. In addition, no matter in gas-free or gas-poor scenario, 55 Cnc, GJ 876, and WASP-47 systems do not follow the angular-momentum-deficit model. Therefore, our results reveal important formation histories of these multi-planet systems.",2020-12-17T07:44:45Z,2020-12-17T07:44:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09431v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09431v1,astro-ph.EP
Smart and Context-Aware System employing Emotions Recognition,"Stuti Sehgal, Harsh Sharma, Akshat Anand","People have the ability to make sensible assumptions about other people's emotional states by being sympathetic, and because of our common sense of knowledge and the ability to think visually. Over the years, much research has been done on providing machines with the ability to detect human emotions and to develop automated emotional intelligence systems. The computer's ability to detect human emotions is gaining popularity in creating sensitive systems such as learning environments, health care systems and real-world. Improving people's health has been the subject of much research. This paper describes the formation as conceptual evidence of emotional acquisition and control in intelligent health settings. The authors of this paper aim for an unconventional approach with a friendly look to get emotional scenarios from the system to establish a functional, non-intrusive and emotionally-sensitive environment where users can do their normal activities naturally and see the program only when pleasant mood activating services are received. The context-sensitive system interacts with users to detect and differentiate emotions through facial expressions or speech recognition, to make music recommendations and mood color treatments with the services installed on their IoT devices.",2021-06-29T05:36:19Z,2021-06-29T05:36:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15101v1,"cs.HC, cs.MA"
Rational Verification for Probabilistic Systems,"Julian Gutierrez, Lewis Hammond, Anthony W. Lin, Muhammad Najib, Michael Wooldridge","Rational verification is the problem of determining which temporal logic properties will hold in a multi-agent system, under the assumption that agents in the system act rationally, by choosing strategies that collectively form a game-theoretic equilibrium. Previous work in this area has largely focussed on deterministic systems. In this paper, we develop the theory and algorithms for rational verification in probabilistic systems. We focus on concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), which can be used to model uncertainty and randomness in complex multi-agent environments. We study the rational verification problem for both non-cooperative games and cooperative games in the qualitative probabilistic setting. In the former case, we consider LTL properties satisfied by the Nash equilibria of the game and in the latter case LTL properties satisfied by the core. In both cases, we show that the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete, thus not harder than the much simpler verification problem of model checking LTL properties of systems modelled as Markov decision processes (MDPs).",2021-07-19T19:24:16Z,2021-07-26T09:52:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09119v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09119v2,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.LO"
Enhanced TEMPO algorithm for quantum path integrals with off-diagonal   system-bath coupling: applications to photonic quantum networks,"Marten Richter, Stephen Hughes","Multitime system correlations functions are relevant in various areas of physics and science, dealing with system-bath interaction including spectroscopy and quantum optics, where many of these schemes include an off-diagonal system bath interaction. Here we extend the enhanced TEMPO algorithm for quantum path integrals using tensor networks [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 240602 (2019)] to open quantum systems with off-diagonal coupling beyond a single two level system. We exemplify the approach on a coupled cavity waveguide system with spatially separated quantum two-state emitters, though many other applications in material science are possible, including entangled photon propagation, photosynthesis spectroscopy and on-chip quantum optics with realistic dissipation.",2021-10-04T11:31:44Z,2022-02-02T17:14:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01334v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01334v2,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.comp-ph"
Exact linear reduction for rational dynamical systems,"Antonio Jiménez-Pastor, Joshua Paul Jacob, Gleb Pogudin","Detailed dynamical systems models used in life sciences may include dozens or even hundreds of state variables. Models of large dimension are not only harder from the numerical perspective (e.g., for parameter estimation or simulation), but it is also becoming challenging to derive mechanistic insights from such models. Exact model reduction is a way to address this issue by finding a self-consistent lower-dimensional projection of the corresponding dynamical system. A recent algorithm CLUE allows one to construct an exact linear reduction of the smallest possible dimension such that the fixed variables of interest are preserved. However, CLUE is restricted to systems with polynomial dynamics. Since rational dynamics occurs frequently in the life sciences (e.g., Michaelis-Menten or Hill kinetics), it is desirable to extend CLUE to the models with rational dynamics. In this paper, we present an extension of CLUE to the case of rational dynamics and demonstrate its applicability on examples from literature. Our implementation is available in version 1.5 of CLUE at https://github.com/pogudingleb/CLUE.",2022-01-31T17:34:04Z,2022-07-04T20:07:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13373v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13373v3,"q-bio.QM, cs.SC, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.DS"
Interconnectedness in Education Systems,"Cristian Candia, Javier Pulgar, Flavio Pinheiro","Underlying complex systems, there is a rich web of interconnected components that determine the relational properties of the system. Yet, traditional methods used in education sciences often disregard the underlying complexity of the educational system and, consequently, its emergence phenomena. Here, we argue that an interconnected vision of educational systems -- from classrooms to an organizational level -- is key to improving learning, social integration, well-being, and decision making, all fundamental aspects of the educational experience. Understanding the education system as an interconnected network of people, degree programs, and institutions requires methods and concepts from computational social sciences. Thus, we can leverage institutional records and (quasi) experimental designs to elicit the relational maps of key players in education and derive their implications in their functioning at all scales. In different settings, from elementary classrooms to higher education programs, we show how mapping the network relationships between entities can lead to the inference of novel insights about education systems and the development of solutions with societal implications.",2022-03-10T20:32:48Z,2022-07-04T23:01:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05624v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05624v2,physics.ed-ph
"Biases in Scholarly Recommender Systems: Impact, Prevalence, and   Mitigation","Michael Färber, Melissa Coutinho, Shuzhou Yuan","With the remarkable increase in the number of scientific entities such as publications, researchers, and scientific topics, and the associated information overload in science, academic recommender systems have become increasingly important for millions of researchers and science enthusiasts. However, it is often overlooked that these systems are subject to various biases. In this article, we first break down the biases of academic recommender systems and characterize them according to their impact and prevalence. In doing so, we distinguish between biases originally caused by humans and biases induced by the recommender system. Second, we provide an overview of methods that have been used to mitigate these biases in the scholarly domain. Based on this, third, we present a framework that can be used by researchers and developers to mitigate biases in scholarly recommender systems and to evaluate recommender systems fairly. Finally, we discuss open challenges and possible research directions related to scholarly biases.",2023-01-18T12:53:28Z,2023-02-13T12:49:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07483v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07483v2,"cs.IR, cs.AI"
What is System Dynamics Modeling? Defining Characteristics and the   Opportunities they Create,"Asmeret Naugle, Saeed Langarudi, Timothy Clancy","A clear definition of system dynamics modeling can provide shared understanding and clarify the impact of the field. We introduce a set of characteristics that define quantitative system dynamics, selected to capture core philosophy, describe theoretical and practical principles, and apply to historical work but be flexible enough to remain relevant as the field progresses. The defining characteristics are: (1) models are based on causal feedback structure, (2) accumulations and delays are foundational, (3) models are equation-based, (4) concept of time is continuous, and (5) analysis focuses on feedback dynamics. We discuss the implications of these principles and use them to identify research opportunities in which the system dynamics field can advance. These research opportunities include causality, disaggregation, data science and artificial intelligence, and contributing to scientific advancement. Progress in these areas has the potential to improve both the science and practice of system dynamics.",2023-07-21T11:17:14Z,2023-07-31T17:57:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11801v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11801v2,"eess.SY, cs.SY, physics.soc-ph"

Characterizing traces of processes defined by precedence and response   constraints: an order theory approach,"Mark Dukes, Anton Sohn","In this paper we consider a general system of activities that can, but do not have to, occur. This system is governed by a set of two types of constraints: precedence and response. A precedence constraint dictates that an activity can only occur if it has been preceded by some other specified activity. Response constraints are similarly defined. An execution of the system is a listing of activities in the order they occur and which satisfies all constraints. Such systems naturally arise in areas of theoretical computer science and decision science. An outcome of the freedom with which activities can occur is that there are many different possible executions, and gaining a combinatorial insight into these is a non-trivial problem.   We characterize all of the ways in which such a system can be executed. Our approach uses order theory to provide a classification in terms of the linear extensions of posets constructed from the constraint sets. This characterization is essential in calculating the stakeholder utility metrics that have been developed by the first author that allow for quantitative comparisons of such systems/processes. It also allows for a better understanding of the theoretical backbone to these processes and their deconstruction as a shuffle product of smaller systems.",2023-11-20T22:19:09Z,2023-11-20T22:19:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12218v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12218v1,"math.CO, cs.DM"

Multi-Robot System Architecture design in SysML and BPMN,"Ahmed R. Sadik, Christian Goerick","Multi-Robot System (MRS) is a complex system that contains many different software and hardware components. This main problem addressed in this article is the MRS design complexity. The proposed solution provides a modular modeling and simulation technique that is based on formal system engineering method, therefore the MRS design complexity is decomposed and reduced. Modeling the MRS has been achieved via two formal Architecture Description Languages (ADLs), which are Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), to design the system blueprints. By using those abstract design ADLs, the implementation of the project becomes technology agnostic. This allows to transfer the design concept from on programming language to another. During the simulation phase, a multi-agent environment is used to simulate the MRS blueprints. The simulation has been implemented in Java Agent Development (JADE) middleware. Therefore, its results can be used to analysis and verify the proposed MRS model in form of performance evaluation matrix.",2024-07-26T14:04:40Z,2024-07-26T14:04:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18749v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18749v1,"cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.SE"
Graph-based Descriptors for Condensed Matter,"An Wang, Gabriele C. Sosso","Computational scientists have long been developing a diverse portfolio of methodologies to characterise condensed matter systems. Most of the descriptors resulting from these efforts are ultimately based on the spatial configurations of particles, atoms, or molecules within these systems. Noteworthy examples include symmetry functions and the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) descriptors, which have significantly advanced the performance of predictive machine learning models for both condensed matter and small molecules. However, while graph-based descriptors are frequently employed in machine learning models to predict the functional properties of small molecules, their application in the context of condensed matter has been limited. In this paper, we put forward a number of graph-based descriptors (such as node centrality and clustering coefficients) traditionally utilised in network science, as alternative representations for condensed matter systems. We apply this graph-based formalism to investigate the dynamical properties and phase transitions of the prototypical Lennard-Jones system. We find that our graph-based formalism outperforms symmetry function descriptors in predicting the dynamical properties and phase transitions of this system. These results demonstrate the broad applicability of graph-based features in representing condensed matter systems, paving the way for exciting advancements in the field of condensed matter through the integration of network science concepts.",2024-08-12T13:50:23Z,2024-08-12T13:50:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06156v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06156v1,"physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn"
Dynamics and Development of the International System: A Complexity   Science Perspective,Ingo Piepers,"In this article I discuss the outcome of an exploratory research project based on complexity science concepts and theories; this research is focused on the Great Power war dynamics in the time period 1495 - 1945. According to this research, the international system has self-organized critical (SOC) characteristics. A critical point is the attractor of the international system. The war dynamics of Great Powers can be illustrated by a power law. As a result of a driving force, the international system is constantly being pushed toward this critical point. The security dilemma is a booster of this driving force. Tension and frustration build up in the international system as a result of various system thresholds, and are periodically discharged through wars. The SOC characteristics of the international system result in a punctuated equilibrium dynamic. The punctuations produce new international systems, each with its specific characteristics. A quantifiable development of the international system toward a condition of increased stability and reduced resilience can be observed. In addition to SOC characteristics, the international system exhibits characteristics of a chaotic system. Chaos, order and development are closely linked. The SOC dynamics generate a process of social expansion. It is possible to explain the social integration of Europe from this perspective.",2006-04-24T15:11:31Z,2014-09-24T01:40:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0604057v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0604057v2,nlin.AO

Measuring Commonality in Recommendation of Cultural Content: Recommender   Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship,"Andres Ferraro, Gustavo Ferreira, Fernando Diaz, Georgina Born","Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural content, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural experience. While the majority of research on recommender systems optimizes for personalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that recommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across populations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness studies probe how systems relate to the broader social role of cultural content, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge. In this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure that reflects the degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with specified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric responds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities. With reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural content. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing pluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare systems' performance using commonality and existing utility, diversity, and fairness metrics. Our results demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior complementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative, non-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening cultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing 'public good' rationales for digital media and ML systems.",2022-08-02T19:14:49Z,2022-08-02T19:14:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01696v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01696v1,"cs.CY, cs.IR"

The workshop is affiliated to the 12th European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL 2013).   Systems biology aims at providing a system-level understanding of biological systems by unveiling their structure, dynamics and control methods. Due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of these systems in space, in organization levels and in time, it is extremely difficult to model them in a uniform way, e.g., by means of differential equations or discrete stochastic processes. Furthermore, such models are often not easily amenable to formal analysis, and their simulations at the organ or even at the cell levels are frequently impractical. Indeed, an important open problem is finding appropriate computational models that scale well for both simulation and formal analysis of biological processes. Hybrid modeling techniques, combining discrete and continuous processes, are gaining more and more attention in such a context, and they have been successfully applied to capture the behavior of many biological complex systems, ranging from genetic networks, biochemical reactions, signaling pathways, cardiac tissues electro-physiology, and tumor genesis. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers in computer science, mathematics, and life sciences, interested in the opportunities and the challenges of hybrid modeling applied to systems biology.   The workshop programme included the keynote presentation of Alessandro Astolfi (Imperial College of London, UK) on Immune response enhancement via hybrid control. Furthermore, 8 papers were selected out of 13 submissions by the Program Committee of HSB 2013. The papers in this volume address the hybrid modeling of a number important biological processes (iron homeostasis network, mammalian cell cycle, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), genetic regulatory network in mammalian sclera) and, the formalisms and techniques for specifying and validating properties of biological systems (such as, robustness, oscillations).",2013-08-27T00:25:04Z,2013-08-27T00:25:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5724v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.5724v1,"cs.CE, cs.LO, cs.SY, I.6.0; I.6.1; I.6.3; I.6.4; I.6.7; I.6.8"
Spin systems with dimerized ground states,Heinz-Jürgen B. Schmidt,"In view of the numerous examples in the literature it is attempted to outline a theory of Heisenberg spin systems possessing dimerized ground states (``DGS systems"") which comprises all known examples. Whereas classical DGS systems can be completely characterized, it was only possible to provide necessary or sufficient conditions for the quantum case. First, for all DGS systems the interaction between the dimers must be balanced in a certain sense. Moreover, one can identify four special classes of DGS systems: (i) Uniform pyramids, (ii) systems close to isolated dimer systems, (iii) classical DGS systems, and (iv), in the case of $s=1/2$, systems of two dimers satisfying four inequalities. Geometrically, the set of all DGS systems may be visualized as a convex cone in the linear space of all exchange constants. Hence one can generate new examples of DGS systems by positive linear combinations of examples from the above four classes.",2004-07-05T14:47:19Z,2004-10-28T13:21:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0407104v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0407104v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Modelling and simulation of complex systems: an approach based on   multi-level agents,Alain-Jérôme Fougères,"A complex system is made up of many components with many interactions. So the design of systems such as simulation systems, cooperative systems or assistance systems includes a very accurate modelling of interactional and communicational levels. The agent-based approach provides an adapted abstraction level for this problem. After having studied the organizational context and communicative capacities of agentbased systems, to simulate the reorganization of a flexible manufacturing, to regulate an urban transport system, and to simulate an epidemic detection system, our thoughts on the interactional level were inspired by human-machine interface models, especially those in ""cognitive engineering"". To provide a general framework for agent-based complex systems modelling, we then proposed a scale of four behaviours that agents may adopt in their complex systems (reactive, routine, cognitive, and collective). To complete the description of multi-level agent models, which is the focus of this paper, we illustrate our modelling and discuss our ongoing work on each level.",2012-01-18T19:02:11Z,2012-01-18T19:02:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3880v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3880v1,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.HC"
A Framework for Hybrid Systems with Denial-of-Service Security Attack,"Shuling Wang, Flemming Nielson, Hanne Riis Nielson","Hybrid systems are integrations of discrete computation and continuous physical evolution. The physical components of such systems introduce safety requirements, the achievement of which asks for the correct monitoring and control from the discrete controllers. However, due to denial-of-service security attack, the expected information from the controllers is not received and as a consequence the physical systems may fail to behave as expected. This paper proposes a formal framework for expressing denial-of-service security attack in hybrid systems. As a virtue, a physical system is able to plan for reasonable behavior in case the ideal control fails due to unreliable communication, in such a way that the safety of the system upon denial-of-service is still guaranteed. In the context of the modeling language, we develop an inference system for verifying safety of hybrid systems, without putting any assumptions on how the environments behave. Based on the inference system, we implement an interactive theorem prover and have applied it to check an example taken from train control system.",2014-03-24T14:51:26Z,2014-03-27T04:05:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6367v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6367v2,"cs.LO, cs.CR, cs.SY"
Dynamic and stochastic systems as a framework for metaphysics and the   philosophy of science,"Christian List, Marcus Pivato","Scientists often think of the world (or some part of it) as a dynamical system, a stochastic process, or a generalization of such a system. Prominent examples of systems are (i) the system of planets orbiting the sun or any other classical mechanical system, (ii) a hydrogen atom or any other quantum-mechanical system, and (iii) the earth's atmosphere or any other statistical mechanical system. We introduce a simple and general framework for describing such systems and show how it can be used to examine some familiar philosophical questions, including the following: how can we define nomological possibility, necessity, determinism, and indeterminism; what are symmetries and laws; what regularities must a system display to make scientific inference possible; is there any metaphysical basis for invoking principles of parsimony such as Occam's Razor when we make such inferences; and what is the role of space and time in a system? Our framework is intended to serve as a toolbox for the formal analysis of systems that is applicable in several areas of philosophy.",2015-08-18T02:20:52Z,2015-08-18T02:20:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04195v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04195v1,physics.hist-ph
A Majoritarian Representative Voting System,"Pietro Speroni di Fenizio, Daniele A. Gewurz","We present an alternative voting system that aims at bridging the gap between proportional representative systems and majoritarian, single winner election systems. The system lets people vote for multiple parties, but then assigns each ballot to a single party. This opens a whole range of possible systems, all representative. We show theoretically that this space is convex. Then among the possible parliaments we present an algorithm to produce the most majoritarian result. We then test the system and compare the results with a pure proportional and a majoritarian voting system showing how the results are comparable with the majoritarian system. Then we simulate the system and show how it tends to produce parties of exponentially decreasing size with always a first, major party. Finally we describe how the system can be used in a context of a parliament made up of two separate houses.",2016-11-30T14:04:32Z,2016-11-30T14:04:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10154v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.10154v1,"cs.GT, cs.MA, math.CO"
A Workflow-Forecast Approach To The Task Scheduling Problem In   Distributed Computing Systems,Andrey Gritsenko,The aim of this paper is to provide a description of deep-learning-based scheduling approach for academic-purpose high-performance computing systems. The share of academic-purpose distributed computing systems (DCS) reaches 17.4 percents amongst TOP500 supercomputer sites (15.6 percents in performance scale) that makes them a valuable object of research. The core of this approach is to predict the future workflow of the system depending on the previously submitted tasks using deep learning algorithm.

The combination of a graphene-based magnetic system and a photochromic azobenzene molecule is chosen as a model system. The {\it trans} and {\it cis} isomers of the azobenzene molecule that can be converted between each other by means of photoexcitations are found to have drastically different effects on the magnetic properties of the system.

Formal Analysis of Optical Systems,"Sanaz Khan-Afshar, Umair Siddique, Mohamed Yousri Mahmoud, Vincent Aravantinos, Ons Seddiki, Osman Hasan, Sofiene Tahar","Optical systems are becoming increasingly important by resolving many bottlenecks in today's communication, electronics, and biomedical systems. However, given the continuous nature of optics, the inability to efficiently analyze optical system models using traditional paper-and-pencil and computer simulation approaches sets limits especially in safety-critical applications. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose to employ higher-order-logic theorem proving as a complement to computational and numerical approaches to improve optical model analysis in a comprehensive framework. The proposed framework allows formal analysis of optical systems at four abstraction levels, i.e., ray, wave, electromagnetic, and quantum.",2014-03-11T11:03:03Z,2014-03-11T11:03:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3039v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.3039v1,"cs.LO, physics.optics"

Finite-Size Scaling of Charge Carrier Mobility in Disordered Organic   Semiconductors,"Pascal Kordt, Thomas Speck, Denis Andrienko","Simulations of charge transport in amorphous semiconductors are often performed in microscopically sized systems. As a result, charge carrier mobilities become system-size dependent. We propose a simple method for extrapolating a macroscopic, nondispersive mobility from the system-size dependence of a microscopic one. The method is validated against a temperature-based extrapolation [Phys. Rev. B 82, 193202 (2010)]. In addition, we provide an analytic estimate of system sizes required to perform nondispersive charge transport simulations in systems with finite charge carrier density, derived from a truncated Gaussian distribution.

The generalized index exactly quantifies the resources necessary for targeted attacks to be undetectable and unidentifiable in the presence of disturbances.

As an application, it is shown that there exists a sensitive dynamical system whose $g$-fuzzification does not have such sensitive dependence for any $g$ in a certain domain.

We show that this domain decomposition method is applicable with the most common control terms.

In the literature there is a lack of data concerning the approximation method which allows to determine diffusion coefficients in such complicated systems. We propose the mass conservation method (MCA) for calculation the diffusivities in phases where the differences in composition is linear. Only one experimental results is needed for determination of the diffusion data. The method is implemented and checked under ternary Ti-NiAl system - this system characterize occurrence three intermetallic phases in diffusion couple Ti-NiAl.,2019-09-30T12:36:59Z,2020-11-17T20:35:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13631v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13631v2,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
From Stateless to Stateful Priorities: Technical Report,Christian Herrera,"We present the notion of stateful priorities for imposing precise restrictions on system actions, in order to meet safety constraints. By using stateful priorities we are able to exclusively restrict erroneous system behavior as specified by the constraint, whereas safe system behavior remains unrestricted. Given a system modeled as a network of discrete automata and an error constraint, we present algorithms which use those inputs to synthesize stateful priorities. We present as well a network transformation which uses synthesized priorities for blocking all system actions leading to the input error. Our experiments with three real-world examples demonstrate the applicability of our approach.",2020-02-20T10:03:34Z,2020-02-20T10:03:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08646v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08646v1,"cs.LO, cs.FL"
Automated Requirements-Based Testing of Black-Box Reactive Systems,"Massimo Narizzano, Luca Pulina, Armando Tacchella, Simone Vuotto","We present a new approach to conformance testing of black-box reactive systems. We consider system specifications written as linear temporal logic formulas to generate tests as sequences of input/output pairs: inputs are extracted from the Buchi automata corresponding to the specifications, and outputs are obtained by feeding the inputs to the systems. Conformance is checked by comparing input/output sequences with automata traces to detect violations of the specifications. We consider several criteria for extracting tests and for stopping generation, and we compare them experimentally using both indicators of coverage and error-detection. The results show that our methodology can generate test suites with good system coverage and error-detection capability.",2020-05-14T06:55:29Z,2020-05-14T06:55:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06750v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06750v1,"cs.LO, cs.SE"

Using contradictions improves question answering systems,"Étienne Fortier-Dubois, Domenic Rosati","This work examines the use of contradiction in natural language inference (NLI) for question answering (QA). Typically, NLI systems help answer questions by determining if a potential answer is \emph{entailed} (supported) by some background context. But is it useful to also determine if an answer contradicts the context? We test this in two settings, multiple choice and extractive QA, and find that systems that incorporate contradiction can do slightly better than entailment-only systems on certain datasets. However, the best performances come from using contradiction, entailment, and QA model confidence scores together. This has implications for the deployment of QA systems in domains such as medicine and science where safety is an issue.",2022-09-28T02:44:01Z,2023-05-29T13:14:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05598v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05598v2,cs.CL

Recommendation Systems and Self Motivated Users,"Gal Bahar, Rann Smorodinsky, Moshe Tennenholtz","Modern recommendation systems rely on the wisdom of the crowd to learn the optimal course of action. This induces an inherent mis-alignment of incentives between the system's objective to learn (explore) and the individual users' objective to take the contemporaneous optimal action (exploit). The design of such systems must account for this and also for additional information available to the users. A prominent, yet simple, example is when agents arrive sequentially and each agent observes the action and reward of his predecessor. We provide an incentive compatible and asymptotically optimal mechanism for that setting. The complexity of the mechanism suggests that the design of such systems for general settings is a challenging task.",2018-07-04T18:23:56Z,2018-07-04T18:23:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01732v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01732v1,cs.GT
On Axiomatization of Lewis' Conditional Logics,Xuefeng Wen,"This paper first shows that the popular axiomatic systems proposed by Nute for Lewis' conditional logics are not equivalent to Lewis' original systems. In particular, the axiom CA which is derivable in Lewis' systems is not derivable in Nute's systems. Then the paper proposes a new set of axiomatizations for Lewis' conditional logics, without using CSO, or RCEA, or the rule of interchange of logical equivalents. Instead, the new axiomatizations adopt two axioms which correspond to cautious monotonicity and cautious cut in nonmonotonic logics, respectively.

AlgebraicSystems: Compositional Verification for Autonomous System   Design,"Georgios Bakirtzis, Ufuk Topcu","Autonomous systems require the management of several model views to assure properties such as safety and security among others. A crucial issue in autonomous systems design assurance is the notion of emergent behavior; we cannot use their parts in isolation to examine their overall behavior or performance. Compositional verification attempts to combat emergence by implementing model transformation as structure-preserving maps between model views.

To obtain the energy, or other properties of the real system, approximations are needed. Working with non interacting fermions is an important simplification, but it may be easier to produce approximations with different choices of the model hamiltonian. The feature that the exact density is (ideally) reproduced can be kept in the newly defined fictitious systems.

A First Exposure to Statistical Mechanics for Life Scientists,"Hernan G. Garcia, Jané Kondev, Nigel Orme, Julie A.

One key virtue of statistical mechanics is that it is designed to examine large systems with many interacting degrees of freedom, providing a clue that it might have some bearing on the analysis of the molecules of living matter. As a result of data on biological systems becoming increasingly quantitative, there is a concomitant demand that the models set forth to describe biological systems be themselves quantitative.

Reducing False Alarms in Searches for Gravitational Waves from   Coalescing Binary Systems,Andres Rodriguez,"LIGO observatories in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA may detect gravitational waves emitted from coalescing binary systems composed of two compact objects. In order to detect compact binary coalescence (CBC) events, LIGO searches utilize matched filtering techniques. Matched filtering is the optimal detection strategy for stationary, Gaussian noise, however, LIGO noise is often non-stationary, non-Gaussian. Non-stationary noise result in an excess of false candidate events, commonly known as false alarms. This thesis develops the r^2 test to reduce the false alarm rate for LIGO CBC searches. Results of the search for primordial black hole binary systems (where each object has less than 1M_solar), in LIGO's Third Science Run (S3) is also presented.   Results of the r^2 test are shown for several LIGO CBC searches, including the binary neutron star searches in the Third and Fourth Science Runs (S3/S4), the S3/S4 primordial black hole searches, and the binary black hole search in the first three months of the Fifth Science Run (S5). The r^2 test significantly reduces the false alarm rate in these searches, while only falsely dismissing a small fraction of simulated events.",2008-02-10T19:51:08Z,2008-02-10T19:51:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1376v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1376v1,gr-qc

On the Expressiveness and Complexity of ATL,"Francois Laroussinie, Nicolas Markey, Ghassan Oreiby","ATL is a temporal logic geared towards the specification and verification of properties in multi-agents systems. It allows to reason on the existence of strategies for coalitions of agents in order to enforce a given property. In this paper, we first precisely characterize the complexity of ATL model-checking over Alternating Transition Systems and Concurrent Game Structures when the number of agents is not fixed. We prove that it is \Delta^P_2 - and \Delta^P_?_3-complete, depending on the underlying multi-agent model (ATS and CGS resp.). We also consider the same problems for some extensions of ATL. We then consider expressiveness issues. We show how ATS and CGS are related and provide translations between these models w.r.t. alternating bisimulation. We also prove that the standard definition of ATL (built on modalities ""Next"", ""Always"" and ""Until"") cannot express the duals of its modalities: it is necessary to explicitely add the modality ""Release"".",2008-04-15T17:18:46Z,2008-05-16T12:50:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2435v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.2435v3,"cs.LO, cs.GT, cs.MA, F.1.1; F.3.1"
The Formation of Massive Star Systems by Accretion,"Mark R. Krumholz, Richard I. Klein, Christopher F. McKee, Stella S. R. Offner, Andrew J. Cunningham","Massive stars produce so much light that the radiation pressure they exert on the gas and dust around them is stronger than their gravitational attraction, a condition that has long been expected to prevent them from growing by accretion. We present three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of a massive prestellar core and find that radiation pressure does not halt accretion. Instead, gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities channel gas onto the star system through non-axisymmetric disks and filaments that self-shield against radiation, while allowing radiation to escape through optically-thin bubbles. Gravitational instabilities cause the disk to fragment and form a massive companion to the primary star. Radiation pressure does not limit stellar masses, but the instabilities that allow accretion to continue lead to small multiple systems.",2009-01-20T21:09:14Z,2009-01-20T21:09:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3157v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.3157v1,"astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA"

"""Structuration"" by Intellectual Organization: The Configuration of   Knowledge in Relations among Structural Components in Networks of Science",Loet Leydesdorff,"Using aggregated journal-journal citation networks, the measurement of the knowledge base in empirical systems is factor-analyzed in two cases of interdisciplinary developments during the period 1995-2005: (i) the development of nanotechnology in the natural sciences and (ii) the development of communication studies as an interdiscipline between social psychology and political science. The results are compared with a case of stable development: the citation networks of core journals in chemistry. These citation networks are intellectually organized by networks of expectations in the knowledge base at the specialty (that is, above-journal) level. This ""structuration"" of structural components (over time) can be measured as configurational information. The latter is compared with the Shannon-type information generated in the interactions among structural components: the difference between these two measures provides us with a measure for the redundancy generated by the specification of a model in the knowledge base of the system.

AISMOTIF-An Artificial Immune System for DNA Motif Discovery,K. R Seeja,"Discovery of transcription factor binding sites is a much explored and still exploring area of research in functional genomics. Many computational tools have been developed for finding motifs and each of them has their own advantages as well as disadvantages. Most of these algorithms need prior knowledge about the data to construct background models. However there is not a single technique that can be considered as best for finding regulatory motifs. This paper proposes an artificial immune system based algorithm for finding the transcription factor binding sites or motifs and two new weighted scores for motif evaluation. The algorithm is enumerative, but sufficient pruning of the pattern search space has been incorporated using immune system concepts. The performance of AISMOTIF has been evaluated by comparing it with eight state of art composite motif discovery algorithms and found that AISMOTIF predicts known motifs as well as new motifs from the benchmark dataset without any prior knowledge about the data.",2011-07-05T06:01:20Z,2011-07-05T06:01:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1128v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.1128v1,cs.CE

The aim is to be able to model the behaviour of systems without estimating parameter values and fixing the exact quantitative dynamics. Traditional applications are the study of the dynamics of physical and biological systems at a higher level of abstraction than that obtained by estimation of numerical parameter values for a fixed quantitative model. Qualitative modelling has been studied and implemented to varying degrees of sophistication in Petri nets, process calculi and constraint programming.

Weak bisimulation for coalgebras over order enriched monads,Tomasz Brengos,"The paper introduces the notion of a weak bisimulation for coalgebras whose type is a monad satisfying some extra properties. In the first part of the paper we argue that systems with silent moves should be modelled coalgebraically as coalgebras whose type is a monad. We show that the visible and invisible part of the functor can be handled internally inside a monadic structure. In the second part we introduce the notion of an ordered saturation monad, study its properties, and show that it allows us to present two approaches towards defining weak bisimulation for coalgebras and compare them.

New Method to Detect the Transport Scattering Mechanisms of Graphene   Carriers,"Shuang Tang, Mildred S. Dresselhaus","Detecting the carrier scattering mechanisms in a materials system is important for transport related science and engineering. The approaches of fast laser process and electrical conductivity matching were used in previous literature, which do not give accurate information on scattering relaxation time as a function of carrier energy for intrinsic photon-free transport. Graphene is considered as a model system in materials science studying for its simple atomic and electronic structures. Here we have developed a new methodology to detect the scattering relaxation time as a function of carrier energy, which can be used to infer the carrier scattering mechanisms at different temperatures. Our method utilizes the measured values of optimal Seebeck coefficient, for both P-type and N-type materials. This new approach can eliminate the influence from photon-carrier scattering in the fast-laser method, and avoid the over-fitting issue in the electrical conductivity matching method. We have then applied the new approach in the SiO2 substrated graphene system, and discovered that the Dirac carriers are mainly scattered by short-range interactions at 40 K. The scatter strength of long-range Coulomb interaction increases with temperature. At 300 K, the long-range and short-range interactions scatter the Dirac carriers with almost comparable strengths.",2014-10-18T04:45:56Z,2014-10-18T04:45:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4907v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4907v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall"

Recent efforts have focused on develop- ing artificial systems that can mimic microorganisms, and in particular their self-propulsion. Here, we report on the design and characterization of syn- thetic self-propelled particles that migrate upstream, known as positive rheo- taxis. This phenomenon results from a purely physical mechanism involving the interplay between the polarity of the particles and their alignment by a viscous torque. We show quantitative agreement between experimental data and a simple model of an overdamped Brownian pendulum. The model no- tably predicts the existence of a stagnation point in a diverging flow.

It is typically assumed to manifest as a momentum-dependent splitting of a single initially spin-degenerate band into two branches with opposite spin polarisation. Here, combining polarisation-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission measurements with density-functional theory calculations, we show that the two ""spin-split"" branches of the model giant Rashba system BiTeI additionally develop disparate orbital textures, each of which is coupled to a distinct spin configuration.

Type-based Self-stabilisation for Computational Fields,"Ferruccio Damiani, Mirko Viroli","Emerging network scenarios require the development of solid large-scale situated systems. Unfortunately, the diffusion/aggregation computational processes therein often introduce a source of complexity that hampers predictability of the overall system behaviour. Computational fields have been introduced to help engineering such systems: they are spatially distributed data structures designed to adapt their shape to the topology of the underlying (mobile) network and to the events occurring in it, with notable applications to pervasive computing, sensor networks, and mobile robots. To assure behavioural correctness, namely, correspondence of micro-level specification (single device behaviour) with macro-level behaviour (resulting global spatial pattern), we investigate the issue of self-stabilisation for computational fields. We present a tiny, expressive, and type-sound calculus of computational fields, and define sufficient conditions for self-stabilisation, defined as the ability to react to changes in the environment finding a new stable state in finite time.

In particular, automated machine learning (AutoML) systems seek to automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter, we present a genetic programming-based AutoML system called TPOT that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification problem. Further, we analyze a large database of pipelines that were previously used to solve various supervised classification problems and identify 100 short series of machine learning operations that appear the most frequently, which we call the building blocks of machine learning pipelines. We harness these building blocks to initialize TPOT with promising solutions, and find that this sensible initialization method significantly improves TPOT's performance on one benchmark at no cost of significantly degrading performance on the others. Thus, sensible initialization with machine learning pipeline building blocks shows promise for GP-based AutoML systems, and should be further refined in future work.",2016-07-29T18:06:39Z,2016-07-29T18:06:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08878v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08878v1,"cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.LG"

Notably, our quantitative deduction system extends in a natural way the equational system for probabilistic bisimilarity given by Stark and Smolka by introducing an axiom for dealing with the Kantorovich distance between probability distributions.

Our first principles electronic structure calculations reveal that for Co/Ru (electron or iso-electronic) doping at Fe sites or P doping at As sites result in a reduction of Stoner factor with increasing doping concentration. On the contrary, in case of Na/K (hole) doping at the Ba sites, Stoner factor is enhanced for higher doping concentrations. This may be considered as an indicator of elevation of ""magnetic fluctuation"" in these systems. We find that the Stoner factor uniquely follows the variation of the pnictide height z$_{As}$/Fe-As bond length with various kinds of doping.

We begin with the intuitive observation that evaluating the performance of an AI system is a form of measurement. In all other science and engineering disciplines, the devices used to measure are called instruments, and all measurements are recorded with respect to the characteristics of the instruments used. One does not report mass, speed, or length, for example, of a studied object without disclosing the precision (measurement variance) and resolution (smallest detectable change) of the instrument used. It is extremely common in the AI literature to compare the performance of two systems by using a crowd-sourced dataset as an instrument, but failing to report if the performance difference lies within the capability of that instrument to measure. To illustrate the adoption of metrology to benchmark datasets we use the word similarity benchmark WS353 and several previously published experiments that use it for evaluation.",2019-11-05T15:30:08Z,2019-11-05T15:30:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01875v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01875v1,cs.AI

Using an Ethics of Care to Promote Diverse Voices","Marc Cheong, Kobi Leins, Simon Coghlan","Those working on policy, digital ethics and governance often refer to issues in `computer science', that includes, but is not limited to, common subfields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Science (CS) Computer Security (InfoSec), Computer Vision (CV), Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Systems, (IS), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Systems Architecture. Within this framework, this paper is a preliminary exploration of two hypotheses, namely 1) Each community has differing inclusion of minoritised groups (using women as our test case); and 2) Even where women exist in a community, they are not published representatively. Using data from 20,000 research records, totalling 503,318 names, preliminary data supported our hypothesis. We argue that ACM has an ethical duty of care to its community to increase these ratios, and to hold individual computing communities to account in order to do so, by providing incentives and a regular reporting system, in order to uphold its own Code.",2021-01-19T04:44:28Z,2021-01-19T04:44:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07463v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07463v1,cs.CY
Losing the battle over best-science guidance early in a crisis: Covid-19   and beyond,"L. Illari, N. Johnson Restrepo, R. Leahy, N. Velasquez, Y. Lupu, N. F. Johnson","Ensuring widespread public exposure to best-science guidance is crucial in a crisis, e.g. Covid-19, climate change. Mapping the emitter-receiver dynamics of Covid-19 guidance among 87 million Facebook users, we uncover a multi-sided battle over exposure that gets lost well before the pandemic's official announcement. By the time Covid-19 vaccines emerge, the mainstream majority -- including many parenting communities -- have moved even closer to more extreme communities. The hidden heterogeneity explains why Facebook's own promotion of best-science guidance also missed key audience segments. A simple mathematical model reproduces these exposure dynamics at the system level.

Convolutional neural networks enable high-fidelity prediction of   path-dependent diffusion barrier spectra in multi-principal element alloys,"Zhao Fan, Bin Xing, Penghui Cao","The emergent multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) provide a vast compositional space to search for novel materials for technological advances. However, how to efficiently identify optimal compositions from such a large design space for targeted properties is a grand challenge in material science. Here we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can accurately and efficiently predict path-dependent vacancy migration energy barriers, which are critical to diffusion behaviors and many high-temperature properties, of MPEAs at any compositions and with different chemical short-range orders within a given alloy system. The success of the CNN model makes it promising for developing a database of diffusion barriers for different MPEA systems, which would accelerate alloy screening for the discovery of new compositions with desirable properties. Besides, the length scale of local configurations relevant to migration energy barriers is uncovered, and the implications of this success to other aspects of materials science are discussed.",2022-03-12T19:12:40Z,2022-03-23T19:50:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06503v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06503v3,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.app-ph"

Cultivated Wildness: Technodiversity and Wildness in Machines,"Zihao Zhang, Bradley Cantrell","This paper investigates the idea of cultivated wildness at the intersection of landscape design and artificial intelligence. The paper posits that contemporary landscape practices should overcome the potentially single understanding on wilderness, and instead explore landscape strategies to cultivate new forms of wild places via ideas and concerns in contemporary Environmental Humanities, Science and Technology Studies, Ecological Sciences, and Landscape Architecture. Drawing cases in environmental engineering, computer science, and landscape architecture research, this paper explores a framework to construct wild places with intelligent machines. In this framework, machines are not understood as a layer of ""digital infrastructure"" that is used to extend localized human intelligence and agency. Rather machines are conceptualized as active agents who can participate in the intelligence of co-production. Recent developments in cybernetic technologies such as sensing networks, artificial intelligence, and cyberphysical systems can also contribute to establishing the framework. At the heart of this framework is ""technodiversity,"" in parallel with biodiversity, since a singular vision on technological development driven by optimization and efficiency reinforces a monocultural approach that eliminates other possible relationships to construct with the environment. Thus, cultivated wildness is also about recognizing ""wildness"" in machines.",2023-05-03T13:25:51Z,2023-05-03T13:25:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02328v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02328v1,"cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Domain-specific ChatBots for Science using Embeddings,Kevin G. Yager,"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful machine-learning systems capable of handling a myriad of tasks. Tuned versions of these systems have been turned into chatbots that can respond to user queries on a vast diversity of topics, providing informative and creative replies. However, their application to physical science research remains limited owing to their incomplete knowledge in these areas, contrasted with the needs of rigor and sourcing in science domains. Here, we demonstrate how existing methods and software tools can be easily combined to yield a domain-specific chatbot. The system ingests scientific documents in existing formats, and uses text embedding lookup to provide the LLM with domain-specific contextual information when composing its reply. We similarly demonstrate that existing image embedding methods can be used for search and retrieval across publication figures.

A Universal Framework for Accurate and Efficient Geometric Deep Learning   of Molecular Systems,"Shuo Zhang, Yang Liu, Lei Xie","Molecular sciences address a wide range of problems involving molecules of different types and sizes and their complexes. Recently, geometric deep learning, especially Graph Neural Networks, has shown promising performance in molecular science applications. However, most existing works often impose targeted inductive biases to a specific molecular system, and are inefficient when applied to macromolecules or large-scale tasks, thereby limiting their applications to many real-world problems. To address these challenges, we present PAMNet, a universal framework for accurately and efficiently learning the representations of three-dimensional (3D) molecules of varying sizes and types in any molecular system. Inspired by molecular mechanics, PAMNet induces a physics-informed bias to explicitly model local and non-local interactions and their combined effects. As a result, PAMNet can reduce expensive operations, making it time and memory efficient. In extensive benchmark studies, PAMNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regarding both accuracy and efficiency in three diverse learning tasks: small molecule properties, RNA 3D structures, and protein-ligand binding affinities.

Typically, it is used in problems with diagonal system-bath coupling, where analytical expressions for discretized influence functional are available. In this work, we aim to address issues related to off-diagonal coupling by extending the TEMPO algorithm to accommodate arbitrary basis sets. The proposed approach is based on computing the derivative of the discretized path integral expression of a generalized influence functional when increasing one time step, which yields an equation of motion valid for non-diagonal basis set and arbitrary number of non-commuting baths. The generalized influence functional is then obtained by integrating the resulting differential equation.

Such a telescope would observe targets across the entire solar system, engaging a broad spectrum of the science community. It would ensure that the high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations of the solar system in visible and UV wavelengths revolutionized by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) could be extended. A dedicated telescope for solar system science would: (a) transform our understanding of time-dependent phenomena in our solar system that cannot be studied currently under programs to observe and visit new targets and (b) enable a comprehensive survey and spectral characterization of minor bodies across the solar system, which requires a large time allocation not supported by existing facilities. The time-domain phenomena to be explored are critically reliant on high spatial resolution UV-visible observations. This paper presents science themes and key questions that require a long-lasting space telescope dedicated to planetary science that can capture high-quality, consistent data at the required cadences that are free from effects of the terrestrial atmosphere and differences across observing facilities. Such a telescope would have excellent synergy with astrophysical facilities by placing planetary discoveries made by astrophysics assets in temporal context, as well as triggering detailed follow-up observations using larger telescopes.

Robust Stability Analysis of a Class of LTV Systems,"Shahzad Ahmed, Hafiz Zeeshan Iqbal Khan, Jamshed Riaz","Many physical systems are inherently time-varying in nature. When these systems are linearized around a trajectory, generally, the resulting system is Linear Time-Varying (LTV). LTV systems describe an important class of linear systems and can be thought of as a natural extension of LTI systems. However, it is well known that, unlike LTI systems, the eigenvalues of an LTV system do not determine its stability. In this paper, the stability conditions for a class of LTV systems are derived. This class is composed of piecewise LTV systems, i.e. LTV systems that are piecewise linear in time. Sufficient conditions of stability are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by using the Lyapunov stability criterion. The feasibility of LMIs guarantees the stability of a given piecewise LTV system. Furthermore, uncertain piecewise LTV systems with scalar parametric uncertainty are also considered. Sufficient conditions for robust stability of this case are also presented, which come out to be quasi-LMIs, which can be optimized using a bisection algorithm to find the bounds of uncertainty for which the system is stable. The proposed method is applied to the problem of pitch angle control of a space launch vehicle, and the results are presented.",2023-09-22T17:48:12Z,2023-09-22T17:48:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13033v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13033v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

The main focus of this paper is another large (D=6.5m Magellan telescope) AO system (MagAO) which has been very productive in the visible (particularly at the H-alpha emission line). MagAO is an advanced Adaptive Secondary Mirror (ASM) AO system at the Magellan in Chile. This ASM secondary has 585 actuators with <1 msec response times (0.7 ms typically). MagAO utilizes a 1 kHz pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). The relatively small actuator pitch (~22 cm/subap, 300 modes, upgraded to 30 pix dia.

Topological Run-time Monitoring for Complex Systems,"Matteo Rucco, Luca Tesei, Emanuela Merelli","In this paper we introduce a new data-driven run-time monitoring system for analysing the behaviour of time evolving complex systems. The monitor controls the evolution of the whole system but it is mined from the data produced by its single interacting components. Relevant behavioural changes happening at the component level and that are responsible for global system evolution are captured by the monitor. Topological Data Analysis is used for shaping and analysing the data for mining an automaton mimicking the global system dynamics, the so-called Persistent Entropy Automaton (PEA). A slight augmented PEA, the monitor, can be used to run current or past executions of the system to mine temporal invariants, for instance through statistical reasoning. Such invariants can be formulated as properties of a temporal logic, e.g. bounded LTL, that can be run-time model-checked. We have performed a feasibility assessment of the PEA and the associated monitoring system by analysing a simulated biological complex system, namely the human immune system. The application of the monitor to simulated traces reveals temporal properties that should be satisfied in order to reach immunization memory.",2019-08-06T09:42:19Z,2019-08-06T09:42:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03489v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03489v1,"cs.LO, cs.FL, q-bio.TO"
Shield Synthesis for Real: Enforcing Safety in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Meng Wu, Jingbo Wang, Jyotirmoy Deshmukh, Chao Wang","Cyber-physical systems are often safety-critical in that violations of safety properties may lead to catastrophes. We propose a method to enforce the safety of systems with real-valued signals by synthesizing a runtime enforcer called the shield. Whenever the system violates a property, the shield, composed with the system, makes correction instantaneously to ensure that no erroneous output is generated by the combined system. While techniques for synthesizing Boolean shields are well understood, they do not handle real-valued signals ubiquitous in cyber-physical systems, meaning corrections may be either unrealizable or inefficient to compute in the real domain. We solve the realizability and efficiency problems by statically analyzing the compatibility of predicates defined over real-valued signals, and using the analysis result to constrain a two-player safety game used to synthesize the shield.

Sauro","Linear time-invariant (LTI) systems appear frequently in natural sciences and engineering contexts. Many LTI systems are described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). For example, biological gene regulation, analog filter circuits, and simple mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic systems can all be described with varying approximations as LTI systems using ODEs. While linearity and time-invariance are straightforward to demonstrate for closed-form system definitions, determining whether an ODE describes a system with LTI properties is less obvious and rarely discussed in depth in the literature. Complications arise due to slightly different definitions of linearity in different contexts. This commentary is intended to provide clarity on this subtle point, and act as an instructional aid or educational supplement.",2019-12-17T05:53:36Z,2019-12-17T05:53:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07830v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07830v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.DS, math.OC"
Symbolic Reachability Analysis of High Dimensional Max-Plus Linear   Systems,"Muhammad Syifa'ul Mufid, Dieky Adzkiya, Alessandro Abate","This work discusses the reachability analysis (RA) of Max-Plus Linear (MPL) systems, a class of continuous-space, discrete-event models defined over the max-plus algebra. Given the initial and target sets, we develop algorithms to verify whether there exist trajectories of the MPL system that, starting from the initial set, eventually reach the target set. We show that RA can be solved symbolically by encoding the MPL system, as well as initial and target sets into difference logic, and then checking the satisfaction of the resulting logical formula via an off-the-shelf satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver. The performance and scalability of the developed SMT-based algorithms are shown to clearly outperform state-of-the-art RA algorithms for MPL systems, newly allowing to investigate RA of high-dimensional MPL systems: the verification of models with more than 100 continuous variables shows the applicability of these techniques to MPL systems of industrial relevance.",2020-07-09T02:19:18Z,2020-07-09T02:19:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04510v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04510v1,"cs.LO, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.RA"
Session Coalgebras: A Coalgebraic View on Session Types and   Communication Protocols,"Alex C. Keizer, Henning Basold, Jorge A. Pérez","Compositional methods are central to the development and verification of software systems. They allow to break down large systems into smaller components, while enabling reasoning about the behaviour of the composed system. For concurrent and communicating systems, compositional techniques based on behavioural type systems have received much attention. By abstracting communication protocols as types, these type systems can statically check that programs interact with channels according to a certain protocol, whether the intended messages are exchanged in a certain order. In this paper, we put on our coalgebraic spectacles to investigate session types, a widely studied class of behavioural type systems. We provide a syntax-free description of session-based concurrency as states of coalgebras. As a result, we rediscover type equivalence, duality, and subtyping relations in terms of canonical coinductive presentations. In turn, this coinductive presentation makes it possible to elegantly derive a decidable type system with subtyping for $\pi$-calculus processes, in which the states of a coalgebra will serve as channel protocols. Going full circle, we exhibit a coalgebra structure on an existing session type system, and show that the relations and type system resulting from our coalgebraic perspective agree with the existing ones.",2020-11-11T11:36:06Z,2020-11-11T11:36:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05712v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05712v1,cs.LO
Autonomics: In Search of a Foundation for Next Generation Autonomous   Systems,"David Harel, Assaf Marron, Joseph Sifakis","The potential benefits of autonomous systems have been driving intensive development of such systems, and of supporting tools and methodologies. However, there are still major issues to be dealt with before such development becomes commonplace engineering practice, with accepted and trustworthy deliverables. We argue that a solid, evolving, publicly available, community-controlled foundation for developing next generation autonomous systems is a must. We discuss what is needed for such a foundation, identify a central aspect thereof, namely, decision-making, and focus on three main challenges: (i) how to specify autonomous system behavior and the associated decisions in the face of unpredictability of future events and conditions and the inadequacy of current languages for describing these; (ii) how to carry out faithful simulation and analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include humans, physical artifacts, and other systems,; and (iii) how to engineer systems that combine executable model-driven techniques and data-driven machine learning techniques. We argue that autonomics, i.e., the study of unique challenges presented by next generation autonomous systems, and research towards resolving them, can introduce substantial contributions and innovations in system engineering and computer science.",2019-11-17T02:27:31Z,2019-11-17T02:27:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07133v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07133v1,cs.SE
Possible instabilities in quadratic and cubic nodal line fermion systems   with correlated interactions,"Jing-Rong Wang, Wei Li, Chang-Jin Zhang","Influence of short-range four-fermion interactions on quadratic and cubic nodal line fermion systems is studied by renormalization group theory. It is found that arbitrarily weak four-fermion interaction could drive quadratic or cubic nodal line fermion system to a new phase. According to the initial conditions and value of fermion flavor, the system may appear three kinds of instabilities. First, quadratic or cubic nodal line is split into conventional nodal lines, thus the system becomes nodal line semimetal. Second, finite excitonic gap is generated, and the system becomes an excitonic insulator. Third, the system is driven into superconducting phase. Thus, quadratic and cubic nodal line fermion systems are rare strong correlated fermion systems in three dimension under the influence of four-fermion interactions.

Dimensionality reduction of discrete-time dynamical systems,Chengyi Tu,"One of the outstanding problems in complexity science and dynamical system theory is understanding the dynamic behavior of high-dimensional networked systems and their susceptibility to transitions to undesired states. Because of varied interactions, large number of parameters and different initial conditions, the study is extremely difficult and existing methods can be applied only to continuous-time systems. Here we propose an analytical framework for collapsing N-dimensional discrete-time systems into a S+1-dimensional manifold as a function of S effective parameters with S << N. Specifically, we provide a quantitative prediction of the quality of the low-dimensional collapse. We test our framework on a variety of real-world complex systems showing its good performance and correctly identify the regions in the parameter space corresponding to the system's transitions. Our work offers an analytical tool to reduce dimensionality of discrete-time networked systems that can be applied to a broader set of systems and dynamics.",2022-06-18T03:43:39Z,2022-06-18T03:43:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11855v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11855v1,"math.DS, nlin.CD"
"Multi-Agent Modeling of Dynamical Systems: A Self-organized, Emergent,   Homeostatic and Autopoietic Approach",Nelson Fernandez,"This thesis presents the theoretical, conceptual and methodological aspects that support the modeling of dynamical systems (DS) by using several agents. The modeling approach permits the assessment of properties representing order, change, equilibrium, adaptability, and autonomy, in DS. The modeling processes were supported by a conceptual corpus regarding systems dynamics, multi-agent systems, graph theory, and, particularly, the information theory. Besides to the specification of the dynamical systems as a computational network of agents, metrics that allow characterizing and assessing the inherent complexity of such systems were defined. As a result, properties associated with emergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis were defined, formalized and measured. The validation of the underlying DS model was carried out on discrete systems (boolean networks and cellular automata) and ecological systems. The central contribution of this thesis was the development of a methodological approach for DS modeling. This approach includes a larger set of properties than in traditional studies, what allows us to deepen in questioning essential issues associated with the DS field. All this was achieved from a simple base of calculation and interpretation, which does not require advanced mathematical knowledge, and facilitates their application in different fields of science.",2015-10-02T17:01:17Z,2015-10-02T17:01:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00799v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00799v1,"cs.MA, nlin.AO"
Overview of Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems,André Platzer,"Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are important whenever computer technology interfaces with the physical world as it does in self-driving cars or aircraft control support systems. Due to their many subtleties, controllers for cyber-physical systems deserve to be held to the highest correctness standards. Their correct functioning is crucial, which explains the broad interest in safety analysis technology for their mathematical models, which are called hybrid systems because they combine discrete dynamics with continuous dynamics. Differential dynamic logic (dL) provides logical specification and rigorous reasoning techniques for hybrid systems. The logic dL is implemented in the theorem prover KeYmaera X, which has been instrumental in verifying ground robot controllers, railway systems, and the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system ACAS X. This chapter provides an informal overview of this logical approach to CPS safety that is detailed in a recent textbook on Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems. It also explains how safety guarantees obtained in the land of verified models reach the level of CPS execution unharmed.",2019-10-24T15:38:12Z,2019-10-24T15:38:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11232v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11232v1,"cs.LO, cs.PL, math.LO, 03B70, 34A38, F.4.1; F.3.1; F.3.2; I.2.3"
It's Time to Play Safe: Shield Synthesis for Timed Systems,"Roderick Bloem, Peter Gjøl Jensen, Bettina Könighofer, Kim Guldstrand Larsen, Florian Lorber, Alexander Palmisano","Erroneous behaviour in safety critical real-time systems may inflict serious consequences. In this paper, we show how to synthesize timed shields from timed safety properties given as timed automata. A timed shield enforces the safety of a running system while interfering with the system as little as possible. We present timed post-shields and timed pre-shields. A timed pre-shield is placed before the system and provides a set of safe outputs. This set restricts the choices of the system. A timed post-shield is implemented after the system. It monitors the system and corrects the system's output only if necessary. We further extend the timed post-shield construction to provide a guarantee on the recovery phase, i.e., the time between a specification violation and the point at which full control can be handed back to the system. In our experimental results, we use timed post-shields to ensure the safety in a reinforcement learning setting for controlling a platoon of cars, during the learning and execution phase, and study the effect.",2020-06-30T11:21:42Z,2020-06-30T11:21:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16688v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16688v1,"cs.LO, cs.LG"
Modeling Adverse Conditions in the Framework of Graph Transformation   Systems,Okan Özkan,"The concept of adverse conditions addresses systems interacting with an adversary environment and finds use also in the development of new technologies. We present an approach for modeling adverse conditions by graph transformation systems. In contrast to other approaches for graph-transformational interacting systems, the presented main constructs are graph transformation systems. We introduce joint graph transformation systems which involve a system, an interfering environment, and an automaton modeling their interaction. For joint graph transformation systems, we introduce notions of (partial) correctness under adverse conditions, which contain the correctness of the system and a recovery condition. As main result, we show that two instances of correctness, namely k-step correctness (recovery in at most k steps after an environment intervention) and last-minute correctness (recovery until next environment intervention) are expressible in LTL (linear temporal logic), and that a weaker notion of k-step correctness is expressible in CTL (computation tree logic).",2020-12-03T02:27:39Z,2020-12-03T02:27:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01657v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01657v1,"cs.LO, cs.MA"

This paper introduces three critical properties of systems, called system connectivity, interaction soundness and data validity, and presents a related modeling and analysis method, based on a kind of Petri nets called VPN. For a given system, a model including component nets and interaction structure nets is constructed by using VPNs. The component net describes the internal process of each component, while the interaction structure net reflects the dynamic interaction between components. Based on this model, three properties are defined and analyzed.

The Open Systems View,"Michael E. Cuffaro, Stephan Hartmann","There is a deeply entrenched view in philosophy and physics, the closed systems view, according to which isolated systems are conceived of as fundamental. On this view, when a system is under the influence of its environment this is described in terms of a coupling between it and a separate system which taken together are isolated. We argue against this view, and in favor of the alternative open systems view, for which systems interacting with their environment are conceived of as fundamental, and the environment's influence is represented via the dynamical equations that govern the system's evolution. Taking quantum theories of closed and open systems as our case study, and considering three alternative notions of fundamentality: (i)~ontic fundamentality, (ii)~epistemic fundamentality, and (iii)~explanatory fundamentality, we argue that the open systems view is fundamental, and that this has important implications for the philosophy of physics, the philosophy of science, and for metaphysics.",2021-12-21T10:57:44Z,2023-06-02T14:26:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11095v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11095v2,"physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"
Formal Methods for Characterization and Analysis of Quality   Specifications in Component-based Systems,Aritra Hazra,"Component-based design paradigm is of paramount importance due to prolific growth in the complexity of modern-day systems. Since the components are developed primarily by multi-party vendors and often assembled to realize the overall system, it is an onus of the designer to certify both the functional and non-functional requirements of such systems. Several of the earlier works concentrated on formally analyzing the behavioral correctness, safety, security, reliability and robustness of such compositional systems. However, the assurance for quality measures of such systems is also considered as an important parameter for their acceptance. Formalization of quality measures is still at an immature state and often dictated by the user satisfaction. This paper presents a novel compositional framework for reliable quality analysis of component-based systems from the formal quality specifications of its constituent components. The proposed framework enables elegant and generic computation methods for quality attributes of various component-based system structures. In addition to this, we provide a formal query-driven quality assessment and design exploration framework which enables the designer to explore various component structures and operating setups and finally converge into better acceptable systems. A detailed case-study is presented over a component-based system structure to show the efficacy and practicality of our proposed framework.",2022-05-29T07:08:11Z,2022-05-29T07:08:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14586v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14586v1,"cs.SE, cs.LO"

Prerequisites for a wide-spread application are an easy-to-use workflow for generating training datasets in a reasonable time, and the capability of the network to generalize to unseen systems. In contrast to most previous works where training systems are similar to the evaluation dataset, we propose to adapt the type of training system to the network architecture. Specifically, we apply a fully convolutional network and, thus, design 3D systems of randomly located voxels with randomly assigned physical properties. The idea is tested for the transient heat diffusion in electronic systems.

We formulate the quantum mechanical determining equations for second order integrals of motion in the cylindrical coordinates and we find all quadratically integrable systems of the cylindrical type. Among them we search for systems admitting additional integrals of motion. We find all systems with an additional first order integral both in classical and quantum mechanics. It turns out that all these systems have already been known and no other exist. We also find all systems with an additional integral of type $L^2+\ldots$, respectively $L_y p_y-L_x p_y+\ldots$, of which the majority is new to the literature.

Fully Automated Verification of Linear Time-Invariant Systems against   Signal Temporal Logic Specifications via Reachability Analysis,"Niklas Kochdumper, Stanley Bak","While reachability analysis is one of the most promising approaches for formal verification of dynamic systems, a major disadvantage preventing a more widespread application is the requirement to manually tune algorithm parameters such as the time step size. Manual tuning is especially problematic if one aims to verify that the system satisfies complicated specifications described by signal temporal logic formulas since the effect the tightness of the reachable set has on the satisfaction of the specification is often non-trivial to see for humans. We address this problem with a fully-automated verifier for linear systems, which automatically refines all parameters for reachability analysis until it can either prove or disprove that the system satisfies a signal temporal logic formula for all initial states and all uncertain inputs. Our verifier combines reachset temporal logic with dependency preservation to obtain a model checking approach whose over-approximation error converges to zero for adequately tuned parameters. While we in this work focus on linear systems for simplicity, the general concept we present can equivalently be applied for nonlinear and hybrid systems.",2023-06-07T01:21:41Z,2024-04-08T12:03:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04089v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04089v2,"cs.LO, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.DS"
A Data Mining-Based Dynamical Anomaly Detection Method for Integrating   with an Advance Metering System,Sarit Maitra,"Building operations consume 30% of total power consumption and contribute 26% of global power-related emissions. Therefore, monitoring, and early detection of anomalies at the meter level are essential for residential and commercial buildings. This work investigates both supervised and unsupervised approaches and introduces a dynamic anomaly detection system. The system introduces a supervised Light Gradient Boosting machine and an unsupervised autoencoder with a dynamic threshold. This system is designed to provide real-time detection of anomalies at the meter level. The proposed dynamical system comes with a dynamic threshold based on the Mahalanobis distance and moving averages. This approach allows the system to adapt to changes in the data distribution over time. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated using real-life power consumption data collected from smart metering systems. This empirical testing ensures that the system's performance is validated under real-world conditions. By detecting unusual data movements and providing early warnings, the proposed system contributes significantly to visual analytics and decision science.

Seeing and interacting with the invisible: A powerful tool for the   learning of science,Vera Montalbano,"In order to describe natural phenomena, science develops sophisticated models that use mathematical and formal languages which seem, and often are, very far from common experience. When a phenomenon is not accessible to our senses, its description is indirect and understanding can be difficult for those who are not trained to understand the consequences of formal languages used by scientists. When one succeed to obtain a direct visualization of a phenomenon inaccessible to senses, it is possible to get a deeper understanding since a very effective channel of learning is involved. A wider and more profound result in learning process can be obtained if the physical system utilized for visualization enables direct interaction with the phenomenon. From the infrared vision to cosmic rays, from the magnetic field to the flow of energy, many phenomena can be suitable for building systems that allow capturing a greater awareness of the physical world. Some examples of such systems are given for relevant topics in physics and for mathematical tools. They were designed for a summer school for students in the last years of high school or for deepening laboratories addressed to talented students in secondary school, but with some attention it is possible to adapt them to other cases like high school classes or undergraduate students.",2014-01-14T01:50:24Z,2014-01-27T00:49:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3047v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3047v2,physics.ed-ph
The Limitations of Standardized Science Tests as Benchmarks for   Artificial Intelligence Research: Position Paper,Ernest Davis,"In this position paper, I argue that standardized tests for elementary science such as SAT or Regents tests are not very good benchmarks for measuring the progress of artificial intelligence systems in understanding basic science. The primary problem is that these tests are designed to test aspects of knowledge and ability that are challenging for people; the aspects that are challenging for AI systems are very different. In particular, standardized tests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledge can be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specific features that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark. I analyze the Physics subject SAT in some detail and the New York State Regents Science test more briefly. I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by using standardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory. The one major real advantage is that the significance is easily explained to the public; but I argue that even this is a somewhat mixed blessing. I conclude by arguing that, first, more appropriate collections of exam style problems could be assembled, and second, that there are better kinds of benchmarks than exam-style problems. In an appendix I present a collection of sample exam-style problems that test kinds of knowledge missing from the standardized tests.",2014-11-06T14:44:12Z,2015-10-16T20:17:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1629v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1629v2,cs.AI
"Network psychometrics and cognitive network science open new ways for   detecting, understanding and tackling the complexity of math anxiety: A   review",Massimo Stella,"Math anxiety is a clinical pathology impairing cognitive processing in math-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced, low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly with academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students' well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating math anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g. graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math anxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of interacting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a given cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways for unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can enable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.",2021-08-31T12:43:43Z,2021-08-31T12:43:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13800v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13800v1,"cs.SI, cs.CL, math.HO, physics.soc-ph"
Changes from Classical Statistics to Modern Statistics and Data Science,"Kai Zhang, Shan Liu, Momiao Xiong","A coordinate system is a foundation for every quantitative science, engineering, and medicine. Classical physics and statistics are based on the Cartesian coordinate system. The classical probability and hypothesis testing theory can only be applied to Euclidean data. However, modern data in the real world are from natural language processing, mathematical formulas, social networks, transportation and sensor networks, computer visions, automations, and biomedical measurements. The Euclidean assumption is not appropriate for non Euclidean data. This perspective addresses the urgent need to overcome those fundamental limitations and encourages extensions of classical probability theory and hypothesis testing , diffusion models and stochastic differential equations from Euclidean space to non Euclidean space. Artificial intelligence such as natural language processing, computer vision, graphical neural networks, manifold regression and inference theory, manifold learning, graph neural networks, compositional diffusion models for automatically compositional generations of concepts and demystifying machine learning systems, has been rapidly developed. Differential manifold theory is the mathematic foundations of deep learning and data science as well. We urgently need to shift the paradigm for data analysis from the classical Euclidean data analysis to both Euclidean and non Euclidean data analysis and develop more and more innovative methods for describing, estimating and inferring non Euclidean geometries of modern real datasets. A general framework for integrated analysis of both Euclidean and non Euclidean data, composite AI, decision intelligence and edge AI provide powerful innovative ideas and strategies for fundamentally advancing AI. We are expected to marry statistics with AI, develop a unified theory of modern statistics and drive next generation of AI and data science.",2022-10-30T21:35:53Z,2022-10-30T21:35:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03756v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03756v1,"stat.ME, cs.LG"
The Astronomy Commons Platform: A Deployable Cloud-Based Analysis   Platform for Astronomy,"Steven Stetzler, Mario Jurić, Kyle Boone, Andrew Connolly, Colin T. Slater, Petar Zečević","We present a scalable, cloud-based science platform solution designed to enable next-to-the-data analyses of terabyte-scale astronomical tabular datasets. The presented platform is built on Amazon Web Services (over Kubernetes and S3 abstraction layers), utilizes Apache Spark and the Astronomy eXtensions for Spark for parallel data analysis and manipulation, and provides the familiar JupyterHub web-accessible front-end for user access. We outline the architecture of the analysis platform, provide implementation details, rationale for (and against) technology choices, verify scalability through strong and weak scaling tests, and demonstrate usability through an example science analysis of data from the Zwicky Transient Facility's 1Bn+ light-curve catalog. Furthermore, we show how this system enables an end-user to iteratively build analyses (in Python) that transparently scale processing with no need for end-user interaction.   The system is designed to be deployable by astronomers with moderate cloud engineering knowledge, or (ideally) IT groups. Over the past three years, it has been utilized to build science platforms for the DiRAC Institute, the ZTF partnership, the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration, the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing, as well as for numerous short-term events (with over 100 simultaneous users).

"Science, Technology and Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics","Clóves Gonçalves Rodrigues, Roberto Luzzi","The binomial Science & Technology (S & T) is inseparable. In this contribution are presented some general considerations on the question of the aspect and interrelationships of the Science, Technology, Government and Society, and the role of Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics that are present in the nowadays highly sophisticated technologies and industrial processes that contribute to the wealth and well being of world society. The evolution of the Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics is briefly described. In present days remarkable development of all the modern technology, essential for the welfare and progress of the global society, imposes an immense stress on basic Physics, and consequently on Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics, in situations like, for example: fluids with complex structures, electronics and photonics involving systems out of equilibrium, nano-technologies, low-dimensional systems, non-linear and ultrafast processes in semiconductors devices, and soft matter. It is shown that the Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics can deal, within a certain degree of triumph, with some these situations, namely: 1. nonconventional thermo-hydrodynamics; 2. ultrafast relaxation processes in semiconductors devices; 3. nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein-like condensations and coherent states; 4. low-dimensional semiconductors; 5. thermo-statistics of complex structured systems; 6. nonlinear higher-order thermo-hydrodynamics; and 7. nonlinear transport in semiconductors devices. These areas are of particular interest, at the scientific, technological and at the production line, and therefore of relevance for government and society, successfully analyzed in terms of the formalism of Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics.",2021-10-02T14:43:48Z,2021-10-02T14:43:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03429v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03429v1,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
An integrated heterogeneous computing framework for ensemble simulations   of laser-induced ignition,"Kazuki Maeda, Thiago Teixeira, Jonathan M. Wang, Jeffrey M. Hokanson, Caetano Melone, Mario Di Renzo, Steve Jones, Javier Urzay, Gianluca Iaccarino","An integrated computational framework is introduced to study complex engineering systems through physics-based ensemble simulations on heterogeneous supercomputers. The framework is primarily designed for the quantitative assessment of laser-induced ignition in rocket engines. We develop and combine an implicit programming system, a compressible reacting flow solver, and a data generation/management strategy on a robust and portable platform. We systematically present this framework using test problems on a hybrid CPU/GPU machine. Efficiency, scalability, and accuracy of the solver are comprehensively assessed with canonical unit problems. Ensemble data management and autoencoding are demonstrated using a canonical diffusion flame case. Sensitivity analysis of the ignition of a turbulent, gaseous fuel jet is performed using a simplified, three-dimensional model combustor. Our approach unifies computer science, physics and engineering, and data science to realize a cross-disciplinary workflow. The framework is exascale-oriented and can be considered a benchmark for future computational science studies of real-world systems.",2022-02-04T20:49:31Z,2022-02-04T20:49:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02319v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02319v1,"cs.CE, cs.DC, physics.data-an, physics.flu-dyn"
Rational Synthesis,"Dana Fisman, Orna Kupferman, Yoad Lustig","Synthesis is the automated construction of a system from its specification. The system has to satisfy its specification in all possible environments. Modern systems often interact with other systems, or agents. Many times these agents have objectives of their own, other than to fail the system. Thus, it makes sense to model system environments not as hostile, but as composed of rational agents; i.e., agents that act to achieve their own objectives. We introduce the problem of synthesis in the context of rational agents (rational synthesis, for short). The input consists of a temporal-logic formula specifying the system and temporal-logic formulas specifying the objectives of the agents. The output is an implementation T of the system and a profile of strategies, suggesting a behavior for each of the agents. The output should satisfy two conditions. First, the composition of T with the strategy profile should satisfy the specification. Second, the strategy profile should be an equilibria in the sense that, in view of their objectives, agents have no incentive to deviate from the strategies assigned to them. We solve the rational-synthesis problem for various definitions of equilibria studied in game theory. We also consider the multi-valued case in which the objectives of the system and the agents are still temporal logic formulas, but involve payoffs from a finite lattice.",2009-07-17T08:51:23Z,2009-07-17T08:51:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3019v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.3019v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT"
A Game-Theoretic approach to Fault Diagnosis of Hybrid Systems,"Davide Bresolin, Marta Capiluppi","Physical systems can fail. For this reason the problem of identifying and reacting to faults has received a large attention in the control and computer science communities. In this paper we study the fault diagnosis problem for hybrid systems from a game-theoretical point of view. A hybrid system is a system mixing continuous and discrete behaviours that cannot be faithfully modeled neither by using a formalism with continuous dynamics only nor by a formalism including only discrete dynamics. We use the well known framework of hybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and we define a Fault Diagnosis Game on them, using two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The environment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a fault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behaviour of the system and announces whether a fault has occurred or not. Existence of a winning strategy for the diagnoser implies that faults can be detected correctly, while computing such a winning strategy corresponds to implement a diagnoser for the system. We will show how to determine the existence of a winning strategy, and how to compute it, for some decidable classes of hybrid automata like o-minimal hybrid automata.",2011-06-07T01:07:30Z,2011-06-07T01:07:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1244v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1244v1,"cs.FL, cs.GT"
Operational Decision Support in the Presence of Uncertainties,Corneliu T. C. Arsene,"This book addresses the scientific domains of operations research, information science and statistics with a focus on engineering applications. The purpose of this book is to report on the implications of the loop equations formulation of the state estimation procedure of the network systems, for the purpose of the implementation of Decision Support (DS) systems for the operational control of the network systems. In general an operational DS comprises a series of standalone applications from which the mathematical modeling and simulation of the distribution systems and the managing of the uncertainty in the decision-making process are essential in order to obtain efficient control and monitoring of the distribution systems. The mathematical modeling and simulation forms the basis for detailed optimization of the network operations and the second one uses uncertainty based reasoning in order to reduce the complexity of the network system and to increase the credibility of its model. This book reports on the integration of the two aspects of operational DS into a single computational framework of loop network equations. The proposed DS system will be validated using case studies taken from the water industry. The optimal control of water distribution systems is an important problem because the models are non-linear and large-scale and measurements are prone to errors and very often they are incomplete.",2017-01-16T15:45:53Z,2018-04-12T23:35:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04681v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.04681v3,"cs.SY, cs.CE, math.OC"
"Research Needed in Computational Social Science for Power System   Reliability, Resilience, and Restoration","Jaber Valinejad, Lamine Mili, Natalie van der Wal","In the literature, smart grids are modeled as cyber-physical power systems without considering the computational social aspects. However, end-users are playing a key role in their operation and response to disturbances via demand response and distributed energy resources. Therefore, due to the critical role of active and passive end-users and the intermittency of renewable energy, smart grids must be planned and operated by considering the computational social aspects in addition to the technical aspects. The level of cooperation, flexibility, and other social features of the various stakeholders, including consumers, prosumers, and microgrids, affect the system efficiency, reliability, and resilience. In this paper, we design an artificial society simulating the interaction between power systems and the social communities that they serve via agent-based modeling inspired by Barsade's theory on the emotional spread. The simulation results show a decline in the consumers' and prosumers' satisfaction levels induced by a shortage of electricity. It also shows the effects of social diffusion via the Internet and mass media on the satisfaction level. In view of the importance of computational social science for power system applications and the limited number of publications devoted to it, we provide a list of research topics that need to be achieved to enhance the reliability and resilience of power systems' operation and planning.",2020-10-22T04:39:15Z,2020-10-22T04:39:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08064v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08064v1,"cs.MA, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Towards an Algebra for Cascade Effects,"Elie M. Adam, Munther A. Dahleh, Asuman Ozdaglar","We introduce a new class of (dynamical) systems that inherently capture cascading effects (viewed as consequential effects) and are naturally amenable to combinations. We develop an axiomatic general theory around those systems, and guide the endeavor towards an understanding of cascading failure. The theory evolves as an interplay of lattices and fixed points, and its results may be instantiated to commonly studied models of cascade effects.   We characterize the systems through their fixed points, and equip them with two operators. We uncover properties of the operators, and express global systems through combinations of local systems. We enhance the theory with a notion of failure, and understand the class of shocks inducing a system to failure. We develop a notion of mu-rank to capture the energy of a system, and understand the minimal amount of effort required to fail a system, termed resilience. We deduce a dual notion of fragility and show that the combination of systems sets a limit on the amount of fragility inherited.",2015-06-21T17:36:15Z,2017-07-05T09:31:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06394v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06394v4,"cs.DM, cs.LO, cs.SI, math.CO"
Automated Verification and Synthesis of Stochastic Hybrid Systems: A   Survey,"Abolfazl Lavaei, Sadegh Soudjani, Alessandro Abate, Majid Zamani","Stochastic hybrid systems have received significant attentions as a relevant modelling framework describing many systems, from engineering to the life sciences: they enable the study of numerous applications, including transportation networks, biological systems and chemical reaction networks, smart energy and power grids, and beyond. Automated verification and policy synthesis for stochastic hybrid systems can be inherently challenging: this is due to the heterogeneity of their dynamics (presence of continuous and discrete components), the presence of uncertainty, and in some applications the large dimension of state and input sets. Over the past few years, a few hundred articles have investigated these models, and developed diverse and powerful approaches to mitigate difficulties encountered in the analysis and synthesis of such complex stochastic systems. In this survey, we overview the most recent results in the literature and discuss different approaches, including (in)finite abstractions, verification and synthesis for temporal logic specifications, stochastic similarity relations, (control) barrier certificates, compositional techniques, and a selection of results on continuous-time stochastic systems; we finally survey recently developed software tools that implement the discussed approaches.

The Dynamical Consequences of a Super-Earth in the Solar System,Stephen R. Kane,"Placing the architecture of the Solar System within the broader context of planetary architectures is one of the primary topics of interest within planetary science. Exoplanet discoveries have revealed a large range of system architectures, many of which differ substantially from the Solar System model. One particular feature of exoplanet demographics is the relative prevalence of super-Earth planets, for which the Solar System lacks a suitable analog, presenting a challenge to modeling their interiors and atmospheres. Here we present the results of a large suite of dynamical simulations that insert a hypothetical planet in the mass range 1-10 $M_\oplus$ within the semi-major axis range 2-4 AU, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. We show that, although the system dynamics remain largely unaffected when the additional planet is placed near 3 AU, Mercury experiences substantial instability when the additional planet lies in the range 3.1-4.0 AU, and perturbations to the Martian orbit primarily result when the additional planet lies in the range 2.0-2.7 AU. We further show that, although Jupiter and Saturn experience relatively small orbital perturbations, the angular momentum transferred to the ice giants can result in their ejection from the system at key resonance locations of the additional planet. We discuss the implications of these results for the architecture of the inner and outer solar system planets, and for exoplanetary systems.",2023-02-13T19:01:54Z,2023-02-22T00:39:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06641v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06641v4,astro-ph.EP
Organizing Scientific Knowledge From Energy System Research Using the   Open Research Knowledge Graph,"Oliver Karras, Jan Göpfert, Patrick Kuckertz, Tristan Pelser, Sören Auer","Engineering sciences, such as energy system research, play an important role in developing solutions to technical, environmental, economic, and social challenges of our modern society. In this context, the transformation of energy systems into climate-neutral systems is one of the key strategies for mitigating climate change. For the transformation of energy systems, engineers model, simulate and analyze scenarios and transformation pathways to initiate debates about possible transformation strategies. For these debates and research in general, all steps of the research process must be traceable to guarantee the trustworthiness of published results, avoid redundancies, and ensure their social acceptance. However, the analysis of energy systems is an interdisciplinary field as the investigations of large, complex energy systems often require the use of different software applications and large amounts of heterogeneous data. Engineers must therefore communicate, understand, and (re)use heterogeneous scientific knowledge and data. Although the importance of FAIR scientific knowledge and data in the engineering sciences and energy system research is increasing, little research has been conducted on this topic. When it comes to publishing scientific knowledge and data from publications, software, and datasets (such as models, scenarios, and simulations) openly available and transparent, energy system research lags behind other research domains. According to Schmitt et al. and Nie{\ss}e et al., engineers need technical support in the form of infrastructures, services, and terminologies to improve communication, understanding, and (re)use of scientific knowledge and data.",2024-01-24T10:46:32Z,2024-01-24T10:46:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13365v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13365v1,cs.DL
Lagrangian Neural Networks for Reversible Dissipative Evolution,"Veera Sundararaghavan, Megna N. Shah, Jeff P. Simmons","There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.",2024-05-23T14:47:07Z,2024-05-26T21:03:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14645v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14645v2,"cs.LG, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"

Anyone who has postedited a technical report or thesis written by a non-native speaker of English knows the potential of an automated postediting system. For the case of MT-generated text, we argue for the construction of postediting modules that are portable across MT systems, as an alternative to hardcoding improvements inside any one system.

Baryonic systems with charm and bottom in the bound state soliton model,V. B. Kopeliovich,"The binding energies of baryonic systems (BS) with baryon number $B=2, 3$ and 4 possessing heavy flavor, charm and bottom, are estimated within the rigid oscillator version of the bound state approach to chiral soliton models. Two tendencies are noted: the binding energy increases with increasing mass of the flavor and with increasing $B$. Therefore, the charmed or bottomed baryonic systems have more chances to be bound than strange baryonic systems discussed previously. The flavor symmetry breaking in decay constants $F$ is considered which is especially important for baryonic systems with bottom quantum numbers. Generally, for heavy flavors the scale of the binding energies of BS depends on the scale of flavor symmetry violation in $r_F=F_F/F_\pi$.",1998-05-12T12:42:33Z,1998-06-22T11:24:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9805296v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9805296v2,hep-ph

During the calibration, a fluorine-rich liquid is activated via a neutron generator and pumped past the front of the calorimeter's crystals. Decays that occur in front of the crystals emit photons of well-defined energy, which are detected in the crystals with the regular data acquisition system. The liquid source system adds only very little material in front of the calorimeter, needs nearly no maintenance, and allows operation at the switch of a key with minimal safety hazards.

Curry-style type Isomorphisms and Game Semantics,Joachim De Lataillade,"Curry-style system F, ie. system F with no explicit types in terms, can be seen as a core presentation of polymorphism from the point of view of programming languages. This paper gives a characterisation of type isomorphisms for this language, by using a game model whose intuitions come both from the syntax and from the game semantics universe. The model is composed of: an untyped part to interpret terms, a notion of game to interpret types, and a typed part to express the fact that an untyped strategy plays on a game. By analysing isomorphisms in the model, we prove that the equational system corresponding to type isomorphisms for Curry-style system F is the extension of the equational system for Church-style isomorphisms with a new, non-trivial equation: forall X.A = A[forall Y.Y/X] if X appears only positively in A.",2007-05-29T14:31:02Z,2007-05-29T14:31:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4228v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.4228v1,"cs.LO, F.3.2"

Symbolic Backwards-Reachability Analysis for Higher-Order Pushdown   Systems,"Matthew Hague, C. -H. Luke Ong","Higher-order pushdown systems (PDSs) generalise pushdown systems through the use of higher-order stacks, that is, a nested ""stack of stacks"" structure. These systems may be used to model higher-order programs and are closely related to the Caucal hierarchy of infinite graphs and safe higher-order recursion schemes.   We consider the backwards-reachability problem over higher-order Alternating PDSs (APDSs), a generalisation of higher-order PDSs. This builds on and extends previous work on pushdown systems and context-free higher-order processes in a non-trivial manner.

An Efficient Secure Multimodal Biometric Fusion Using Palmprint and Face   Image,"M. Nageshkumar, P. K. Mahesh, M. N. S. Swamy","Biometrics based personal identification is regarded as an effective method for automatically recognizing, with a high confidence a person's identity. A multimodal biometric systems consolidate the evidence presented by multiple biometric sources and typically better recognition performance compare to system based on a single biometric modality. This paper proposes an authentication method for a multimodal biometric system identification using two traits i.e. face and palmprint. The proposed system is designed for application where the training data contains a face and palmprint. Integrating the palmprint and face features increases robustness of the person authentication. The final decision is made by fusion at matching score level architecture in which features vectors are created independently for query measures and are then compared to the enrolment template, which are stored during database preparation.

Similarity Matching Techniques for Fault Diagnosis in Automotive   Infotainment Electronics,Mashud Kabir,"Fault diagnosis has become a very important area of research during the last decade due to the advancement of mechanical and electrical systems in industries. The automobile is a crucial field where fault diagnosis is given a special attention. Due to the increasing complexity and newly added features in vehicles, a comprehensive study has to be performed in order to achieve an appropriate diagnosis model. A diagnosis system is capable of identifying the faults of a system by investigating the observable effects (or symptoms). The system categorizes the fault into a diagnosis class and identifies a probable cause based on the supplied fault symptoms. Fault categorization and identification are done using similarity matching techniques. The development of diagnosis classes is done by making use of previous experience, knowledge or information within an application area. The necessary information used may come from several sources of knowledge, such as from system analysis. In this paper similarity matching techniques for fault diagnosis in automotive infotainment applications are discussed.",2009-09-12T22:06:05Z,2009-09-12T22:06:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2375v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.2375v1,cs.AI
The Multivariate Resultant is NP-hard in any Characteristic,"Bruno Grenet, Pascal Koiran, Natacha Portier","The multivariate resultant is a fundamental tool of computational algebraic geometry. It can in particular be used to decide whether a system of n homogeneous equations in n variables is satisfiable (the resultant is a polynomial in the system's coefficients which vanishes if and only if the system is satisfiable). In this paper we present several NP-hardness results for testing whether a multivariate resultant vanishes, or equivalently for deciding whether a square system of homogeneous equations is satisfiable. Our main result is that testing the resultant for zero is NP-hard under deterministic reductions in any characteristic, for systems of low-degree polynomials with coefficients in the ground field (rather than in an extension). We also observe that in characteristic zero, this problem is in the Arthur-Merlin class AM if the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds true.

Bifurcations in Boolean Networks,"Chris J. Kuhlman, Henning S. Mortveit, David Murrugarra, V. S. Anil Kumar","This paper characterizes the attractor structure of synchronous and asynchronous Boolean networks induced by bi-threshold functions. Bi-threshold functions are generalizations of classical threshold functions and have separate threshold values for the transitions 0 -> 1 (up-threshold) and 1 -> 0 (down-threshold). We show that synchronous bi-threshold systems may, just like standard threshold systems, only have fixed points and 2-cycles as attractors. Asynchronous bi-threshold systems (fixed permutation update sequence), on the other hand, undergo a bifurcation: when the difference \Delta of the down- and up-threshold is less than 2 they only have fixed points as limit sets. However, for \Delta >= 2 they may have long periodic orbits. The limiting case of \Delta = 2 is identified using a potential function argument.

Synthesizing Robust Systems with RATSY,"Roderick Bloem, Hans-Jürgen Gamauf, Georg Hofferek, Bettina Könighofer, Robert Könighofer","Specifications for reactive systems often consist of environment assumptions and system guarantees.

On the constrained growth of complex critical systems,"Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, Antoine Allard, Louis J. Dubé","Critical, or scale independent, systems are so ubiquitous, that gaining theoretical insights on their nature and properties has many direct repercussions in social and natural sciences. In this report, we start from the simplest possible growth model for critical systems and deduce constraints in their growth : the well-known preferential attachment principle, and, mainly, a new law of temporal scaling. We then support our scaling law with a number of calculations and simulations of more complex theoretical models : critical percolation, self-organized criticality and fractal growth. Perhaps more importantly, the scaling law is also observed in a number of empirical systems of quite different nature : prose samples, artistic and scientific productivity, citation networks, and the topology of the Internet.

The Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Theory of Software Design,Paul Ralph,"Understanding software design practice is critical to understanding modern information systems development. New developments in empirical software engineering, information systems design science and the interdisciplinary design literature combined with recent advances in process theory and testability have created a situation ripe for innovation. Consequently, this paper utilizes these breakthroughs to formulate a process theory of software design practice: Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Theory explains how complex software systems are created by collocated software development teams in organizations. It posits that an independent agent (design team) creates a software system by alternating between three activities: organizing their perceptions about the context, mutually refining their understandings of the context and design space, and manifesting their understanding of the design space in a technological artifact. This theory development paper defines and illustrates Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Theory, grounds its concepts and relationships in existing literature, conceptually evaluates the theory and situates it in the broader context of information systems development.",2013-02-17T12:09:46Z,2013-02-17T12:09:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4061v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4061v1,cs.SE
FOLE: The First-order Logical Environment,Robert E. Kent,"This paper describes the first-order logical environment FOLE. Institutions in general, and logical environments in particular, give equivalent heterogeneous and homogeneous representations for logical systems. As such, they offer a rigorous and principled approach to distributed interoperable information systems via system consequence. Since FOLE is a particular logical environment, this provides a rigorous and principled approach to distributed interoperable first-order information systems. The FOLE represents the formalism and semantics of first-order logic in a classification form. By using an interpretation form, a companion approach defines the formalism and semantics of first-order logical/relational database systems. In a strict sense, the two forms have transformational passages (generalized inverses) between one another. The classification form of first-order logic in the FOLE corresponds to ideas discussed in the Information Flow Framework (IFF).

Coalgebraic Trace Semantics for Continuous Probabilistic Transition   Systems,"Henning Kerstan, Barbara König","Coalgebras in a Kleisli category yield a generic definition of trace semantics for various types of labelled transition systems. In this paper we apply this generic theory to generative probabilistic transition systems, short PTS, with arbitrary (possibly uncountable) state spaces. We consider the sub-probability monad and the probability monad (Giry monad) on the category of measurable spaces and measurable functions. Our main contribution is that the existence of a final coalgebra in the Kleisli category of these monads is closely connected to the measure-theoretic extension theorem for sigma-finite pre-measures. In fact, we obtain a practical definition of the trace measure for both finite and infinite traces of PTS that subsumes a well-known result for discrete probabilistic transition systems.

In these systems, we investigate bounds on the resource consumption for reachability questions. Motivated by this question, we introduce relational structures with resources and a quantitative first-order logic over these structures. We define resource automatic structures as a subclass of these structures and provide an effective method to compute the semantics of the logic on this subclass. Subsequently, we use this framework to solve the bounded reachability problem for resource prefix replacement systems. We achieve this result by extending the well-known saturation method to annotated prefix replacement systems.

Parameter Synthesis for Cardiac Cell Hybrid Models Using Delta-Decisions,"Bing Liu, Soonho Kong, Sicun Gao, Paolo Zuliani, Edmund M.

In this paper we focus on parameter synthesis for hybrid (continuous/discrete) models, as many biological systems can possess multiple operational modes with specific continuous dynamics in each mode. These biological systems are naturally modeled as hybrid automata, most often with nonlinear continuous dynamics. However, hybrid automata are notoriously hard to analyze --- even simple reachability for hybrid systems with linear differential dynamics is an undecidable problem. In this paper we present a parameter synthesis framework based on $\delta$-complete decision procedures that sidesteps undecidability. We demonstrate our method on two highly nonlinear hybrid models of the cardiac cell action potential.

Then, we quantify the a priori unknown performance criterion as a (still unknown) reward function and compute an optimal strategy for the system within the operating envelope allowed by the permissive strategy by using the so-called maximin-Q learning algorithm. We establish both correctness (with respect to the temporal logic specifications) and optimality (with respect to the a priori unknown performance criterion) of this two-step technique for a fragment of temporal logic specifications.

We then characterize L-bisimilarity algebraically, in terms of certain ideals in the polynomial ring that are invariant under Lie-derivation. This characterization allows us to develop a complete algorithm, based on building an ascending chain of ideals, for computing the largest L-bisimulation containing all valid identities that are instances of a user-specified template. A specific largest L-bisimulation can be used to build a reduced system of ode's, equivalent to the original one, but minimal among all those obtainable by linear aggregation of the original equations. A computationally less demanding approximate reduction and linearization technique is also proposed.",2017-10-23T15:51:14Z,2019-02-14T15:47:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08350v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08350v4,cs.LO
An extended type system with lambda-typed lambda-expressions,Matthias Weber,"We present the system $\mathtt{d}$, an extended type system with lambda-typed lambda-expressions. It is related to type systems originating from the Automath project. $\mathtt{d}$ extends existing lambda-typed systems by an existential abstraction operator as well as propositional operators. $\beta$-reduction is extended to also normalize negated expressions using a subset of the laws of classical negation, hence $\mathtt{d}$ is normalizing both proofs and formulas which are handled uniformly as functional expressions. $\mathtt{d}$ is using a reflexive type axiom for a constant $\tau$ to which no function can be typed. Some properties are shown including confluence, subject reduction, uniqueness of types, strong normalization, and consistency. We illustrate how, when using $\mathtt{d}$, due to its limited logical strength, additional axioms must be added both for negation and for the mathematical structures whose deductions are to be formalized.",2018-03-21T07:05:41Z,2020-11-30T16:34:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10143v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10143v6,cs.LO
Advances in sequential measurement and control of open quantum systems,"Stefano Gherardini, Andrea Smirne, Matthias M. Müller, Filippo Caruso","Novel concepts, perspectives and challenges in measuring and controlling an open quantum system via sequential schemes are shown. We discuss how similar protocols, relying both on repeated quantum measurements and dynamical decoupling control pulses, can allow to: (i) Confine and protect quantum dynamics from decoherence in accordance with the Zeno physics. (ii) Analytically predict the probability that a quantum system is transferred into a target quantum state by means of stochastic sequential measurements. (iii) Optimally reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources by orthogonalizing in the frequency domain the filter functions driving the designed quantum-sensor.

Recommendation System based on Semantic Scholar Mining and Topic   modeling: A behavioral analysis of researchers from six conferences,"Hamed Jelodar, Yongli Wang, Mahdi Rabbani, Ru-xin Zhao, Seyedvalyallah Ayobi, Peng Hu, Isma Masood","Recommendation systems have an important place to help online users in the internet society. Recommendation Systems in computer science are of very practical use these days in various aspects of the Internet portals, such as social networks, and library websites. There are several approaches to implement recommendation systems, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one the popular techniques in Topic Modeling. Recently, researchers have proposed many approaches based on Recommendation Systems and LDA. According to importance of the subject, in this paper we discover the trends of the topics and find relationship between LDA topics and Scholar-Context-documents.

The fully actuated tilt-rotor aerial system is equipped with a rigidly mounted end-effector, and is able to exert a 6 degree of freedom force and torque, decoupling the system's translational and rotational dynamics, and enabling precise interaction with the environment while maintaining stability. An impedance controller with selective apparent inertia is formulated to permit compliance in certain degrees of freedom while achieving precise trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection in others.

Generic Encodings of Constructor Rewriting Systems,"Horatiu Cirstea, Pierre-Etienne Moreau","Rewriting is a formalism widely used in computer science and mathematical logic. The classical formalism has been extended, in the context of functional languages, with an order over the rules and, in the context of rewrite based languages, with the negation over patterns. We propose in this paper a concise and clear algorithm computing the difference over patterns which can be used to define generic encodings of constructor term rewriting systems with negation and order into classical term rewriting systems. As a direct consequence, established methods used for term rewriting systems can be applied to analyze properties of the extended systems. The approach can also be seen as a generic compiler which targets any language providing basic pattern matching primitives. The formalism provides also a new method for deciding if a set of patterns subsumes a given pattern and thus, for checking the presence of useless patterns or the completeness of a set of patterns.",2019-05-14T14:06:09Z,2019-06-11T11:07:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06233v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06233v2,"cs.LO, cs.CL, cs.PL"
Dealing with uncertainty in agent-based models for short-term   predictions,"Le-Minh Kieu, Nicolas Malleson, Alison Heppenstall","Agent-based models (ABM) are gaining traction as one of the most powerful modelling tools within the social sciences. They are particularly suited to simulating complex systems. Despite many methodological advances within ABM, one of the major drawbacks is their inability to incorporate real-time data to make accurate short-term predictions. This paper presents an approach that allows ABMs to be dynamically optimised. Through a combination of parameter calibration and data assimilation (DA), the accuracy of model-based predictions using ABM in real time is increased. We use the exemplar of a bus route system to explore these methods. The bus route ABMs developed in this research are examples of ABMs that can be dynamically optimised by a combination of parameter calibration and DA. The proposed model and framework can also be used in an passenger information system, or in an Intelligent Transport Systems to provide forecasts of bus locations and arrival times.",2019-08-22T10:03:15Z,2019-08-22T10:03:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08288v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08288v1,cs.MA

Exploring the Jungle of Intuitionistic Temporal Logics,"Joseph Boudou, Martín Diéguez, David Fernández-Duque, Philip Kremer","The importance of intuitionistic temporal logics in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence has become increasingly clear in the last few years. From the proof-theory point of view, intuitionistic temporal logics have made it possible to extend functional languages with new features via type theory, while from its semantical perspective several logics for reasoning about dynamical systems and several semantics for logic programming have their roots in this framework. In this paper we consider several axiomatic systems for intuitionistic linear temporal logic and show that each of these systems is sound for a class of structures based either on Kripke frames or on dynamic topological systems. Our topological semantics features a new interpretation for the `henceforth' modality that is a natural intuitionistic variant of the classical one. Using the soundness results, we show that the seven logics obtained from the axiomatic systems are distinct.",2019-12-30T11:55:20Z,2021-03-12T15:45:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12895v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12895v2,cs.LO

Causal Emergence in Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems,Thomas F. Varley,"Emergence, the phenomena where a system's micro-scale dynamics facilitate the development of non-trivial, informative higher scales, has become a foundational concept in modern sciences, tying together fields as diverse as physics, biology, economics, and ecology. Despite it's apparent universality and the considerable interest, historically researchers have struggled to provide a rigorous, formal definition of emergence that is applicable across fields. Recent theoretical work using information theory and network science to formalize emergence in state-transition networks (causal emergence) has provided a promising way forward, however the relationship between this new framework and other well-studied system dynamics is unknown. In this study, we apply causal emergence analysis to two well-described dynamical systems: the 88 unique elementary cellular automata and the continuous Rossler system in periodic, critical, and chaotic regimes. We find that emergence, as well as its component elements (determinism, degeneracy, and effectiveness) vary dramatically in different dynamical regimes in sometimes unexpected ways. We conclude that the causal emergence framework provides a rich new area of research to explore both to theoreticians and natural scientists in many fields.",2020-03-29T16:57:56Z,2020-03-29T16:57:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13075v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13075v1,"nlin.CG, nlin.CD"
Conditional Bisimilarity for Reactive Systems,"Mathias Hülsbusch, Barbara König, Sebastian Küpper, Lara Stoltenow","Reactive systems \`a la Leifer and Milner, an abstract categorical framework for rewriting, provide a suitable framework for deriving bisimulation congruences. This is done by synthesizing interactions with the environment in order to obtain a compositional semantics.   We enrich the notion of reactive systems by conditions on two levels: first, as in earlier work, we consider rules enriched with application conditions and second, we investigate the notion of conditional bisimilarity. Conditional bisimilarity allows us to say that two system states are bisimilar provided that the environment satisfies a given condition.   We present several equivalent definitions of conditional bisimilarity, including one that is useful for concrete proofs and that employs an up-to-context technique, and we compare with related behavioural equivalences.

Numerical and analytical results support this claim, which is developed in the case of a simple stochastic model on a graph, the so-called voter model. The importance of the noise when controlling the system is demonstrated, leading to the concept of control length.

We first show the challenges of learning neural ODE in the classical stiff ODE systems of Robertson's problem and propose techniques to mitigate the challenges associated with scale separations in stiff systems. We then present successful demonstrations in stiff systems of Robertson's problem and an air pollution problem. The demonstrations show that the usage of deep networks with rectified activations, proper scaling of the network outputs as well as loss functions, and stabilized gradient calculations are the key techniques enabling the learning of stiff neural ODE.

Given a Boolean network satisfying certain conditions, there is a unique collection of subnetworks so that the network can be reconstructed from these subnetworks by an extension operation. The main result of the paper is that this structural decomposition induces a corresponding decomposition of the network dynamics. The theory is motivated by the search for a mathematical framework to formalize the hypothesis that biological systems are modular, widely accepted in the life sciences, but not well-defined and well-characterized.

Control of birhythmicity: A self-feedback approach,"Debabrata Biswas, Tanmoy Banerjee, Juergen Kurths","Birhythmicity occurs in many natural and artificial systems. In this paper we propose a self-feedback scheme to control birhythmicity. To establish the efficacy and generality of the proposed control scheme, we apply it on three birhythmic oscillators from diverse fields of natural science, namely, an energy harvesting system, the p53-Mdm2 network for protein genesis (the OAK model) and a glycolysis model (modified Decroly-Goldbeter model). Using the harmonic decomposition technique and energy balance method we derive the analytical conditions for the control of birhythmicity. A detailed numerical bifurcation analysis in the parameter space establishes that the control scheme is capable of eliminating birhythmicity and it can also induce transitions between different forms of bistability. As the proposed control scheme is quite general, it can be applied for control of several real systems, particularly in biochemical and engineering systems.",2017-05-31T07:05:09Z,2017-05-31T07:05:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04036v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04036v1,"nlin.AO, nlin.PS"

Firstly, the multi-step adaptive Lasso (MSA-Lasso) regression algorithm is introduced based on the regression algorithm, whose predictive performance has an advantage. Then, an OSSA module is proposed to evaluate and select contingencies in different load conditions. In addition, the Lasso algorithm is employed to predict the security index of each power system operation state with the consideration of bus voltages and power flows, according to Newton-Raphson load flow (NRLF) analysis in post-contingency states.

Security-Aware Synthesis Using Delayed-Action Games,"Mahmoud Elfar, Yu Wang, Miroslav Pajic","Stochastic multiplayer games (SMGs) have gained attention in the field of strategy synthesis for multi-agent reactive systems. However, standard SMGs are limited to modeling systems where all agents have full knowledge of the state of the game. In this paper, we introduce delayed-action games (DAGs) formalism that simulates hidden-information games (HIGs) as SMGs, where hidden information is captured by delaying a player's actions. The elimination of private variables enables the usage of SMG off-the-shelf model checkers to implement HIGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a DAG can be decomposed into subgames that can be independently explored, utilizing parallel computation to reduce the model checking time, while alleviating the state space explosion problem that SMGs are notorious for. In addition, we propose a DAG-based framework for strategy synthesis and analysis. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of the DAG-based synthesis framework on a case study of a human-on-the-loop unmanned-aerial vehicle system under stealthy attacks, where the proposed framework is used to formally model, analyze and synthesize security-aware strategies for the system.",2019-02-12T20:19:58Z,2019-05-30T03:03:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04618v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04618v2,"cs.GT, cs.FL, cs.LO, cs.SE, cs.SY"

Analysis of self-equilibrated networks through cellular modeling,"Omar Aloui, David Orden, Nizar Bel Hadj Ali, Landolf Rhode-Barbarigos","Network equilibrium models represent a versatile tool for the analysis of interconnected objects and their relationships. They have been widely employed in both science and engineering to study the behavior of complex systems under various conditions, including external perturbations and damage. In this paper, network equilibrium models are revisited through graph-theory laws and attributes with special focus on systems that can sustain equilibrium in the absence of external perturbations (self-equilibrium). A new approach for the analysis of self-equilibrated networks is proposed; they are modeled as a collection of cells, predefined elementary network units that have been mathematically shown to compose any self-equilibrated network. Consequently, the equilibrium state of complex self-equilibrated systems can be obtained through the study of individual cell equilibria and their interactions. A series of examples that highlight the flexibility of network equilibrium models are included in the paper. The examples attest how the proposed approach, which combines topological as well as geometrical considerations, can be used to decipher the state of complex systems.",2020-08-11T08:03:32Z,2020-08-11T08:03:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04570v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04570v1,"nlin.AO, cs.CG, math.CO"

These objects pseudo-randomly flash in a visual interface on computer screen. The user must focus on related object to convey desired needs. The system can convey desired needs correctly by detecting P300 wave in acquired 14-channel EEG signal and classifying using linear discriminant analysis classifier just in 15 seconds.

The geometry of the crystal structure allows the realization of chiral phonons, which are associated with the circulation of atoms around their equilibrium positions. Due to the inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry, total pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) of the system vanishes. We show that the doping of these system can lead to a new phase with symmetry F$\bar{4}3$m. New systems (KRbBi$_{4}$ and RbCsBi$_{4}$) do not exhibit soft modes (are stable dynamically). Due to the inversion symmetry breaking, realized chiral phonon modes posses a non-zero total PAM.

Cognitive Models as Simulators: The Case of Moral Decision-Making,"Ardavan S. Nobandegani, Thomas R. Shultz, Irina Rish","To achieve desirable performance, current AI systems often require huge amounts of training data. This is especially problematic in domains where collecting data is both expensive and time-consuming, e.g., where AI systems require having numerous interactions with humans, collecting feedback from them. In this work, we substantiate the idea of $\textit{cognitive models as simulators}$, which is to have AI systems interact with, and collect feedback from, cognitive models instead of humans, thereby making their training process both less costly and faster. Here, we leverage this idea in the context of moral decision-making, by having reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn about fairness through interacting with a cognitive model of the Ultimatum Game (UG), a canonical task in behavioral and brain sciences for studying fairness. Interestingly, these RL agents learn to rationally adapt their behavior depending on the emotional state of their simulated UG responder. Our work suggests that using cognitive models as simulators of humans is an effective approach for training AI systems, presenting an important way for computational cognitive science to make contributions to AI.",2022-10-08T23:14:14Z,2022-10-08T23:14:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04121v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04121v1,"cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.MA, q-bio.NC"
Quantifying Complexity: An Object-Relations Approach to Complex Systems,Stephen Casey,"The best way to model, understand, and quantify the information contained in complex systems is an open question in physics, mathematics, and computer science. The uncertain relationship between entropy and complexity further complicates this question. With ideas drawn from the object-relations theory of psychology, this paper develops an object-relations model of complex systems which generalizes to systems of all types, including mathematical operations, machines, biological organisms, and social structures. The resulting Complex Information Entropy (CIE) equation is a robust method to quantify complexity across various contexts. The paper also describes algorithms to iteratively update and improve approximate solutions to the CIE equation, to recursively infer the composition of complex systems, and to discover the connections among objects across different lengthscales and timescales.

We show that a Nash equilibrium with a simple and intuitive linear structure exists for diffuse prior distributions on the task difficulties.

To solve more complex problems with deep learning, both sizes of training datasets and neural networks are increasing. To train a model with large datasets and networks, distributed deep neural network (DDNN) training technique is necessary. For large-scale DDNN training, HPC clusters are a promising computation environment. In large-scale DDNN on HPC clusters, I/O performance is critical because it is becoming a bottleneck. Most flagship-class HPC clusters have hierarchical storage systems. For designing future HPC storage systems, it is necessary to quantify the performance improvement effect of the hierarchical storage system on the workloads.

Quantifying Masking Fault-Tolerance via Fair Stochastic Games,"Pablo F. Castro, Pedro R. D'Argenio, Ramiro Demasi, Luciano Putruele","We introduce a formal notion of masking fault-tolerance between probabilistic transition systems using stochastic games. These games are inspired in bisimulation games, but they also take into account the possible faulty behavior of systems. When no faults are present, these games boil down to probabilistic bisimulation games. Since these games could be infinite, we propose a symbolic way of representing them so that they can be solved in polynomial time. In particular, we use this notion of masking to quantify the level of masking fault-tolerance exhibited by almost-sure failing systems, i.e., those systems that eventually fail with probability 1. The level of masking fault-tolerance of almost-sure failing systems can be calculated by solving a collection of functional equations. We produce this metric in a setting in which one of the player behaves in a strong fair way (mimicking the idea of fair environments).",2023-09-13T20:52:30Z,2023-09-13T20:52:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07309v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07309v1,"cs.LO, cs.FL, cs.GT"
Communication Modalities,Roman Kuznets,"Epistemic analysis of distributed systems is one of the biggest successes among applications of logic in computer science. The reason for that is that agents' actions are necessarily guided by their knowledge. Thus, epistemic modal logic, with its knowledge and belief modalities (and group versions thereof), has played a vital role in establishing both impossibility results and necessary conditions for solvable distributed tasks. In distributed systems, knowledge is largely attained via communication. It has been standard in both distributed systems and dynamic epistemic logic to treat incoming messages as trustworthy, thus, creating difficulties in the epistemic analysis of byzantine distributed systems where faulty agents may lie. In this paper, we argue that handling such communication scenarios calls for additional modalities representing the informational content of messages that should not be taken at face value. We present two such modalities: hope for the case of fully byzantine agents and creed for non-uniform communication protocols in general.",2024-05-04T08:20:16Z,2024-05-04T08:20:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02606v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02606v1,"cs.DC, cs.LO, cs.MA"
Comparing Lazy Constraint Selection Strategies in Train Routing with   Moving Block Control,"Stefan Engels, Robert Wille","Railroad transportation plays a vital role in the future of sustainable mobility. Besides building new infrastructure, capacity can be improved by modern train control systems, e.g., based on moving blocks. At the same time, there is only limited work on how to optimally route trains using the potential gained by these systems. Recently, an initial approach for train routing with moving block control has been proposed to address this demand. However, detailed evaluations on so-called lazy constraints are missing, and no publicly available implementation exists. In this work, we close this gap by providing an extended approach as well as a flexible open-source implementation that can use different solving strategies. Using that, we experimentally evaluate what choices should be made when implementing a lazy constraint approach.

The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers.

However, advanced techniques are required to deal with the large amounts of data. These unbiased surveys can be used to constrain the size distribution of minor bodies, which represents a piece of the puzzle for the formation models of the Solar System. We aim to identify asteroids in archival images from the ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Science data archive using data mining. We developed a citizen science project on the Zooniverse platform, Hubble Asteroid Hunter (www.asteroidhunter.org) asking members of the public to identify asteroid trails in archival HST images. We used the labels provided by the volunteers to train an automated deep learning model built with Google Cloud AutoML Vision to explore the entire HST archive to detect asteroids crossing the field-of-view. We report the detection of 1701 new asteroid trails identified in archival HST data via our citizen science project and the subsequent machine learning exploration of the ESA HST science data archive. We detect asteroids to a magnitude of 24.5, which are statistically fainter than the populations of asteroids identified from ground-based surveys. The majority of asteroids are distributed near the ecliptic plane, as expected, where we find an approximate density of 80 asteroids per square degree. We match 670 trails (39% of the trails found) with 454 known Solar System objects in the Minor Planet Center database, however, no matches are found for 1031 (61%) trails.

Xorbits: Automating Operator Tiling for Distributed Data Science,"Weizheng Lu, Kaisheng He, Xuye Qin, Chengjie Li, Zhong Wang, Tao Yuan, Xia Liao, Feng Zhang, Yueguo Chen, Xiaoyong Du","Data science pipelines commonly utilize dataframe and array operations for tasks such as data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning. The most popular tools for these tasks are pandas and NumPy. However, these tools are limited to executing on a single node, making them unsuitable for processing large-scale data. Several systems have attempted to distribute data science applications to clusters while maintaining interfaces similar to single-node libraries, enabling data scientists to scale their workloads without significant effort. However, existing systems often struggle with processing large datasets due to Out-of-Memory (OOM) problems caused by poor data partitioning. To overcome these challenges, we develop Xorbits, a high-performance, scalable data science framework specifically designed to distribute data science workloads across clusters while retaining familiar APIs. The key differentiator of Xorbits is its ability to dynamically switch between graph construction and graph execution. Xorbits has been successfully deployed in production environments with up to 5k CPU cores. Its applications span various domains, including user behavior analysis and recommendation systems in the e-commerce sector, as well as credit assessment and risk management in the finance industry. Users can easily scale their data science workloads by simply changing the import line of their pandas and NumPy code. Our experiments demonstrate that Xorbits can effectively process very large datasets without encountering OOM or data-skewing problems. Over the fastest state-of-the-art solutions, Xorbits achieves an impressive 2.66* speedup on average.

The work is going on for the efficient, secure, energy saving techniques for the file systems. As we know that the hardware is going to be fast in performance and low-priced day by day. The software is not built to comeback with the hardware technology. So there is a need to do research in this area to bridge the technology gap.",2013-12-06T09:18:04Z,2013-12-06T09:18:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1810v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.1810v1,cs.OS
Incremental Verification of Parametric and Reconfigurable Markov Chains,"Paul Gainer, Ernst Moritz Hahn, Sven Schewe","The analysis of parametrised systems is a growing field in verification, but the analysis of parametrised probabilistic systems is still in its infancy. This is partly because it is much harder: while there are beautiful cut-off results for non-stochastic systems that allow to focus only on small instances, there is little hope that such approaches extend to the quantitative analysis of probabilistic systems, as the probabilities depend on the size of a system. The unicorn would be an automatic transformation of a parametrised system into a formula, which allows to plot, say, the likelihood to reach a goal or the expected costs to do so, against the parameters of a system. While such analysis exists for narrow classes of systems, such as waiting queues, we aim both lower---stepwise exploring the parameter space---and higher---considering general systems.   The novelty is to heavily exploit the similarity between instances of parametrised systems. When the parameter grows, the system for the smaller parameter is, broadly speaking, present in the larger system. We use this observation to guide the elegant state-elimination method for parametric Markov chains in such a way, that the model transformations will start with those parts of the system that are stable under increasing the parameter. We argue that this can lead to a very cheap iterative way to analyse parametric systems, show how this approach extends to reconfigurable systems, and demonstrate on two benchmarks that this approach scales.",2018-04-05T14:22:43Z,2018-04-05T14:22:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01872v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01872v1,cs.LO
Double Categories of Open Dynamical Systems (Extended Abstract),David Jaz Myers,"A (closed) dynamical system is a notion of how things can be, together with a notion of how they may change given how they are. The idea and mathematics of closed dynamical systems has proven incredibly useful in those sciences that can isolate their object of study from its environment. But many changing situations in the world cannot be meaningfully isolated from their environment - a cell will die if it is removed from everything beyond its walls. To study systems that interact with their environment, and to design such systems in a modular way, we need a robust theory of open dynamical systems.   In this extended abstract, we put forward a general definition of open dynamical system. We define two general sorts of morphisms between these systems: covariant morphisms which include trajectories, steady states, and periodic orbits; and contravariant morphisms which allow for plugging variables of some systems into parameters of other systems. We define an indexed double category of open dynamical systems indexed by their interface and use a double Grothendieck construction to construct a double category of open dynamical systems.   In our main theorem, we construct covariantly representable indexed double functors from the indexed double category of dynamical systems to an indexed double category of spans. This shows that all covariantly representable structures of dynamical systems - including trajectories, steady states, and periodic orbits - compose according to the laws of matrix arithmetic.",2020-05-12T17:56:31Z,2021-02-04T02:21:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05956v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05956v2,"math.CT, math.DS"
A Framework for Heterotic Computing,"Susan Stepney, Viv Kendon, Peter Hines, Angelika Sebald","Computational devices combining two or more different parts, one controlling the operation of the other, for example, derive their power from the interaction, in addition to the capabilities of the parts. Non-classical computation has tended to consider only single computational models: neural, analog, quantum, chemical, biological, neglecting to account for the contribution from the experimental controls. In this position paper, we propose a framework suitable for analysing combined computational models, from abstract theory to practical programming tools. Focusing on the simplest example of one system controlled by another through a sequence of operations in which only one system is active at a time, the output from one system becomes the input to the other for the next step, and vice versa. We outline the categorical machinery required for handling diverse computational systems in such combinations, with their interactions explicitly accounted for. Drawing on prior work in refinement and retrenchment, we suggest an appropriate framework for developing programming tools from the categorical framework. We place this work in the context of two contrasting concepts of ""efficiency"": theoretical comparisons to determine the relative computational power do not always reflect the practical comparison of real resources for a finite-sized computational task, especially when the inputs include (approximations of) real numbers. Finally we outline the limitations of our simple model, and identify some of the extensions that will be required to treat more complex interacting computational systems.",2012-10-02T00:36:02Z,2012-10-02T00:36:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0621v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.0621v1,"cs.ET, cs.LO"
Density Functional Theory is Not Straying from the Path toward the Exact   Functional,Kasper Planeta Kepp,"Recently (Science, 355, 6320, 2017, 49-52) it was argued that density functionals stray from the path towards exactness due to errors in densities (\rho) of 14 atoms and ions computed with several recent functionals. However, this conclusion rests on very compact \rho\ of highly charged 1s2 and 1s22s2 systems, the divergence is due to one particular group's recently developed functionals, whereas other recent functionals perform well, and errors in \rho\ were not compared to actual energies E[\rho] of the same distinct, compact systems, but to general errors for diverse systems. As argued here, a true path can only be defined for E[\rho] and \rho\ for the same systems: By computing errors in E[\rho], it is shown that different functionals show remarkably linear error relationships between \rho\ and E[\rho] on well-defined but different paths towards exactness, and the ranking in Science, 355, 6320, 2017, 49-52 breaks down. For example, M06-2X, said to perform poorly, performs very well on the E,\rho\ paths defined here, and local (non-GGA) functionals rapidly increase errors in E[\rho] due to the failure to describe dynamic correlation of compact systems without the gradient. Finally, a measure of ""exactness"" is given by the product of errors in E[\rho] and \rho; these relationships may be more relevant focus points than a time line if one wants to estimate exactness and develop new exact functionals.",2017-02-02T19:57:06Z,2017-02-02T19:57:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00813v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00813v1,physics.chem-ph

Franklin, Ian Foster","While the Machine Learning (ML) landscape is evolving rapidly, there has been a relative lag in the development of the ""learning systems"" needed to enable broad adoption. Furthermore, few such systems are designed to support the specialized requirements of scientific ML. Here we present the Data and Learning Hub for science (DLHub), a multi-tenant system that provides both model repository and serving capabilities with a focus on science applications. DLHub addresses two significant shortcomings in current systems. First, its selfservice model repository allows users to share, publish, verify, reproduce, and reuse models, and addresses concerns related to model reproducibility by packaging and distributing models and all constituent components. Second, it implements scalable and low-latency serving capabilities that can leverage parallel and distributed computing resources to democratize access to published models through a simple web interface. Unlike other model serving frameworks, DLHub can store and serve any Python 3-compatible model or processing function, plus multiple-function pipelines. We show that relative to other model serving systems including TensorFlow Serving, SageMaker, and Clipper, DLHub provides greater capabilities, comparable performance without memoization and batching, and significantly better performance when the latter two techniques can be employed. We also describe early uses of DLHub for scientific applications.",2018-11-27T19:31:29Z,2018-11-27T19:31:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11213v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11213v1,"cs.LG, cs.DC, stat.ML"
Automating Ambiguity: Challenges and Pitfalls of Artificial Intelligence,Abeba Birhane,"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools increasingly permeate every possible social, political, and economic sphere; sorting, taxonomizing and predicting complex human behaviour and social phenomena. However, from fallacious and naive groundings regarding complex adaptive systems to datasets underlying models, these systems are beset by problems, challenges, and limitations. They remain opaque and unreliable, and fail to consider societal and structural oppressive systems, disproportionately negatively impacting those at the margins of society while benefiting the most powerful.   The various challenges, problems and pitfalls of these systems are a hot topic of research in various areas, such as critical data/algorithm studies, science and technology studies (STS), embodied and enactive cognitive science, complexity science, Afro-feminism, and the broadly construed emerging field of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT). Yet, these fields of enquiry often proceed in silos. This thesis weaves together seemingly disparate fields of enquiry to examine core scientific and ethical challenges, pitfalls, and problems of AI.   In this thesis I, a) review the historical and cultural ecology from which AI research emerges, b) examine the shaky scientific grounds of machine prediction of complex behaviour illustrating how predicting complex behaviour with precision is impossible in principle, c) audit large scale datasets behind current AI demonstrating how they embed societal historical and structural injustices, d) study the seemingly neutral values of ML research and put forward 67 prominent values underlying ML research, e) examine some of the insidious and worrying applications of computer vision research, and f) put forward a framework for approaching challenges, failures and problems surrounding ML systems as well as alternative ways forward.",2022-06-08T22:05:07Z,2022-06-08T22:05:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04179v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04179v1,cs.CY

We also briefly summarize science cases spanning exoplanets to high-redshift galaxy evolution that would benefit from a Keck GLAO system. Initial simulations indicate that a Keck GLAO system would deliver a 1.5x and 2x improvement in FWHM at optical (500 nm) and infrared (1.5 micron), respectively. The infrared instrument, MOSFIRE, is ideally suited for a Keck GLAO feed in that it has excellent image quality and is on the telescope's optical axis. However, it lacks an atmospheric dispersion compensator, which would limit the minimum usable slit size for long-exposure science cases. Similarly, while LRIS and DEIMOS may be able to accept a GLAO feed based on their internal image quality, they lack either an atmospheric dispersion compensator (DEIMOS) or flexure compensation (LRIS) to utilize narrower slits matched to the GLAO image quality. However, some science cases needing shorter exposures may still benefit from Keck GLAO and we will investigate the possibility of installing an ADC.",2018-07-23T21:13:57Z,2018-07-23T21:13:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08832v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08832v1,astro-ph.IM

Much of the progress in open-domain QA systems has been realized through advances in information retrieval methods and corpus construction. In this paper, we focus on the recently introduced ARC Challenge dataset, which contains 2,590 multiple choice questions authored for grade-school science exams. These questions are selected to be the most challenging for current QA systems, and current state of the art performance is only slightly better than random chance. We present a system that rewrites a given question into queries that are used to retrieve supporting text from a large corpus of science-related text. Our rewriter is able to incorporate background knowledge from ConceptNet and -- in tandem with a generic textual entailment system trained on SciTail that identifies support in the retrieved results -- outperforms several strong baselines on the end-to-end QA task despite only being trained to identify essential terms in the original source question. We use a generalizable decision methodology over the retrieved evidence and answer candidates to select the best answer.

AutoGrad: Automated Grading Software for Mobile Game Assignments in   SuaCode Courses,"Prince Steven Annor, Samuel Boateng, Edwin Pelpuo Kayang, George Boateng","Automatic grading systems have been in existence since the turn of the half-century. Several systems have been developed in the literature with either static analysis and dynamic analysis or a hybrid of both methodologies for computer science courses. This paper presents AutoGrad, a novel portable cross-platform automatic grading system for graphical Processing programs developed on Android smartphones during an online course. AutoGrad uses Processing, which is used in the emerging Interactive Media Arts, and pioneers grading systems utilized outside the sciences to assist tuition in the Arts. It also represents the first system built and tested in an African context across over thirty-five countries across the continent. This paper first explores the design and implementation of AutoGrad. AutoGrad employs APIs to download the assignments from the course platform, performs static and dynamic analysis on the assignment to evaluate the graphical output of the program, and returns the grade and feedback to the student. It then evaluates AutoGrad by analyzing data collected from the two online cohorts of 1000+ students of our SuaCode smartphone-based course. From the analysis and students' feedback, AutoGrad is shown to be adequate for automatic assessment, feedback provision to students, and easy integration for both cloud and standalone usage by reducing the time and effort required in grading the 4 assignments required to complete the course.",2021-07-26T14:46:13Z,2021-07-26T14:46:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12244v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12244v1,cs.HC
LQP: The Dynamic Logic of Quantum Information,"Alexandru Baltag, Sonja Smets","The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a dynamic logic formalism for reasoning about information flow in composite quantum systems. This builds on our previous work on a complete quantum dynamic logic for single systems. Here we extend that work to a sound (but not necessarily complete) logic for composite systems, which brings together ideas from the quantum logic tradition with concepts from (dynamic) modal logic and from quantum computation. This Logic of Quantum Programs (LQP) is capable of expressing important features of quantum measurements and unitary evolutions of multi-partite states, as well as giving logical characterisations to various forms of entanglement (for example, the Bell states, the GHZ states etc.). We present a finitary syntax, a relational semantics and a sound proof system for this logic. As applications, we use our system to give formal correctness proofs for the Teleportation protocol and for a standard Quantum Secret Sharing protocol; a whole range of other quantum circuits and programs, including other well-known protocols (for example, superdense coding, entanglement swapping, logic-gate teleportation etc.), can be similarly verified using our logic.",2021-10-04T12:20:23Z,2021-10-04T12:20:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01361v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01361v1,"quant-ph, cs.LO, 03G12, 68Q60, 03B45, 81P10, F.3.1; F.3.0; F.4.1"

Understanding Biology in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"Elsa Lawrence, Adham El-Shazly, Srijit Seal, Chaitanya K Joshi, Pietro Liò, Shantanu Singh, Andreas Bender, Pietro Sormanni, Matthew Greenig","Modern life sciences research is increasingly relying on artificial intelligence approaches to model biological systems, primarily centered around the use of machine learning (ML) models. Although ML is undeniably useful for identifying patterns in large, complex data sets, its widespread application in biological sciences represents a significant deviation from traditional methods of scientific inquiry. As such, the interplay between these models and scientific understanding in biology is a topic with important implications for the future of scientific research, yet it is a subject that has received little attention. Here, we draw from an epistemological toolkit to contextualize recent applications of ML in biological sciences under modern philosophical theories of understanding, identifying general principles that can guide the design and application of ML systems to model biological phenomena and advance scientific knowledge. We propose that conceptions of scientific understanding as information compression, qualitative intelligibility, and dependency relation modelling provide a useful framework for interpreting ML-mediated understanding of biological systems. Through a detailed analysis of two key application areas of ML in modern biological research - protein structure prediction and single cell RNA-sequencing - we explore how these features have thus far enabled ML systems to advance scientific understanding of their target phenomena, how they may guide the development of future ML models, and the key obstacles that remain in preventing ML from achieving its potential as a tool for biological discovery.

Formal Definition and Implementation of Reproducibility Tenets for   Computational Workflows,"Nicholas J.

The slowly resolving reproducibility crisis presents both a sobering warning and an opportunity to iterate on what science and data processing entails. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the world's largest radio telescope, is among the most extensive scientific projects underway and presents grand scientific collaboration and data-processing challenges. In this work, we aim to improve the ability of workflow management systems to facilitate reproducible, high-quality science. This work presents a scale and system-agnostic computational workflow model and extends five well-known reproducibility concepts into seven well-defined tenets for this workflow model. Additionally, we present a method to construct workflow execution signatures using cryptographic primitives in amortized constant time. We combine these three concepts and provide a concrete implementation in Data Activated Flow Graph Engine (DALiuGE), a workflow management system for the SKA to embed specific provenance information into workflow signatures, demonstrating the possibility of facilitating automatic formal verification of scientific quality in amortized constant time. We validate our approach with a simple yet representative astronomical processing task: filtering a noisy signal with a lowpass filter using CPU and GPU methods. This example shows the practicality and efficacy of combining formal tenet definitions with a workflow signature generation mechanism. Our framework, spanning formal UML specification, principled provenance information collection based on reproducibility tenets, and finally, a concrete example implementation in DALiuGE illuminates otherwise obscure scientific discrepancies and similarities between principally identical workflow executions.",2024-06-03T09:38:31Z,2024-12-23T04:48:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01146v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01146v2,cs.DC

Speed and stability issues on traditional hardware preclude routine AIMD simulations for larger systems and longer timescales. We postulate that any practically useful AIMD simulation must generate a trajectory of a minimum 1000 MD steps a day on a moderate cloud resource. In this work, we implement a computing workflow that enables routine calculations at this throughput and demonstrate results for several non-trivial atomistic dynamical systems. In particular, we have employed the GPU implementation of the Quantum ESPRESSO code which we will show increases AIMD productivity compared to the CPU version. In order to take advantage of transient servers (which are more cost and energy effective compared to the stable servers), we have implemented automatic restart/continuation of the AIMD runs within the Schr\""odinger Materials Science Suite. Finally, to reduce simulation size and thus reduce compute time when modeling surfaces, we have implemented a wall potential constraint.

The computational power of a human society: a new model of social   evolution,"David H. Wolpert, Kyle Harper","Social evolutionary theory seeks to explain increases in the scale and complexity of human societies, from origins to present. Over the course of the twentieth century, social evolutionary theory largely fell out of favor as a way of investigating human history, just as advances in complex systems science and computer science saw the emergence of powerful new conceptions of complex systems, and in particular new methods of measuring complexity. We propose that these advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science should be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that end, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with their biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment are computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems using the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here. For simplicity, we construe a society as a set of interacting occupations and technologies. Similarly, under such a model, a biotic environment is a set of interacting distinct ecological and climatic processes. This provides novel ways to characterize social complexity, which we hope will cast new light on the archaeological and historical records. Our framework also provides a natural way to formalize both the energetic (thermodynamic) costs required by a society as it runs, and the ways it can extract thermodynamic resources from the environment in order to pay for those costs -- and perhaps to grow with any left-over resources.",2024-08-16T17:42:28Z,2024-08-16T17:42:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08861v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08861v1,"cs.MA, econ.GN, physics.soc-ph, q-fin.EC"

The error in the stress field that the compliance introduces for finite systems is shown to decay with size as a power law.

Macroscopic signature of protected spins in a dense frustrated magnet,"S. Ghosh, T. F. Rosenbaum, G. Aeppli","The inability of systems of interacting objects to satisfy all constraints simultaneously leads to frustration. A particularly important consequence of frustration is the ability to access certain protected parts of a system without disturbing the others.

Since HRSs include \lambda-abstraction but STRSs do not, we restructure the static dependency pair method to allow \lambda-abstraction, and show that the static dependency pair method also works well on HRSs without new restrictions.",2011-09-26T07:50:07Z,2011-09-26T07:50:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.5468v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.5468v1,cs.LO

Constraint-Based Monitoring of Hyperproperties,"Christopher Hahn, Marvin Stenger, Leander Tentrup","Verifying hyperproperties at runtime is a challenging problem as hyperproperties, such as non-interference and observational determinism, relate multiple computation traces with each other.

Furthermore, the new incoming trace poses requirements on future traces. In our monitoring approach, we focus on those requirements by rewriting a hyperproperty in the temporal logic HyperLTL to a Boolean constraint system. A hyperproperty is then violated by multiple runs of the system if the constraint system becomes unsatisfiable.

The vector algebra war: a historical perspective,"James M. Chappell, Azhar Iqbal, John G. Hartnett, Derek Abbott","There are a wide variety of different vector formalisms currently utilized in engineering and physics. For example, Gibbs' three-vectors, Minkowski four-vectors, complex spinors in quantum mechanics, quaternions used to describe rigid body rotations and vectors defined in Clifford geometric algebra. With such a range of vector formalisms in use, it thus appears that there is as yet no general agreement on a vector formalism suitable for science as a whole. This is surprising, in that, one of the primary goals of nineteenth century science was to suitably describe vectors in three-dimensional space. This situation has also had the unfortunate consequence of fragmenting knowledge across many disciplines, and requiring a significant amount of time and effort in learning the various formalisms. We thus historically review the development of our various vector systems and conclude that Clifford's multivectors best fulfills the goal of describing vectorial quantities in three dimensions and providing a unified vector system for science.",2015-08-29T09:22:13Z,2016-04-22T02:44:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00501v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00501v2,physics.hist-ph
Automating the Verification of Realtime Observers using Probes and the   Modal mu-calculus,"Silvano Dal Zilio, Bernard Berthomieu","A classical method for model-checking timed properties-such as those expressed using timed extensions of temporal logic-is to rely on the use of observers. In this context, a major problem is to prove the correctness of observers. Essentially, this boils down to proving that: (1) every trace that contradicts a property can be detected by the observer; but also that (2) the observer is innocuous, meaning that it cannot interfere with the system under observation. In this paper, we describe a method for automatically testing the correctness of realtime observers. This method is obtained by automating an approach often referred to as visual verification, in which the correctness of a system is performed by inspecting a graphical representation of its state space. Our approach has been implemented on the tool Tina, a model-checking toolbox for Time Petri Net.",2015-09-22T08:41:17Z,2015-09-22T08:41:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06507v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06507v1,cs.LO

It has been demonstrated that the originality issue such conceived leads to the criterion of a substantial aesthetics whose applicability is not restricted to the fine arts domain only covering also physics, biology, cosmology and other fields construed in the complex systems terms. Moreover, it is about a truth criterion related to the traditional personality conception revealing the ontological context transcendent to the gnoseological dualism of subjective and objective reality that is characteristic of modern science and humanities.

Traditional formal verification techniques are well suited to analyse the temporal evolution of programs; however, properties of space are typically not taken into account explicitly. We present a topology-based approach to formal verification of spatial properties depending upon physical space. We define an appropriate logic, stemming from the tradition of topological interpretations of modal logics, dating back to earlier logicians such as Tarski, where modalities describe neighbourhood. We lift the topological definitions to the more general setting of closure spaces, also encompassing discrete, graph-based structures. We extend the framework with a spatial surrounded operator, a propagation operator and with some collective operators.

Solar-Sail Deep Space Trajectory Optimization Using Successive Convex   Programming,"Yu Song, Shengping Gong","This paper presents a novel methodology for solving the time-optimal trajectory optimization problem for interplanetary solar-sail missions using successive convex programming. Based on the non-convex problem, different convexification technologies, such as change of variables, successive linearization, trust regions and virtual control, are discussed to convert the original problem into the formulation of successive convex programming. Because of the free final-time, successive linearization is performed iteratively for the nonconvex terminal state constraints. After the convexification process, each of problems becomes a convex problem, which can be solved effectively.

A Fourth-Generation High-Dimensional Neural Network Potential with   Accurate Electrostatics Including Non-local Charge Transfer,"Tsz Wai Ko, Jonas A. Finkler, Stefan Goedecker, Jörg Behler","Machine learning potentials have become an important tool for atomistic simulations in many fields, from chemistry via molecular biology to materials science. Most of the established methods, however, rely on local properties and are thus unable to take global changes in the electronic structure into account, which result from long-range charge transfer or different charge states. In this work we overcome this limitation by introducing a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential that combines a charge equilibration scheme employing environment-dependent atomic electronegativities with accurate atomic energies. The method, which is able to correctly describe global charge distributions in arbitrary systems, yields much improved energies and substantially extends the applicability of modern machine learning potentials. This is demonstrated for a series of systems representing typical scenarios in chemistry and materials science that are incorrectly described by current methods, while the fourth-generation neural network potential is in excellent agreement with electronic structure calculations.",2020-09-14T14:43:31Z,2020-09-14T14:43:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06484v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06484v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.chem-ph, physics.comp-ph"
Entropic dynamics yields reciprocal relations,Pedro Pessoa,"Entropic dynamics is a framework for defining dynamical systems that is aligned with the principles of information theory. In an entropic dynamics model for motion on a statistical manifold, we find that the rate of changes for expected values is linear to the gradient of entropy with reciprocal (symmetric) coefficients. Reciprocity principles have been useful in physics since Onsager. Here we show how the entropic dynamics reciprocity is a consequence of the information geometric structure of the exponential family, hence it is a general property that can be extended to a broader class of dynamical models.",2021-04-26T14:42:57Z,2021-04-26T14:42:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12621v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12621v1,"math.DS, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.data-an"
Combining human and machine learning for morphological analysis of   galaxy images,"Evan Kuminski, Joe George, John Wallin, Lior Shamir","The increasing importance of digital sky surveys collecting many millions of galaxy images has reinforced the need for robust methods that can perform morphological analysis of large galaxy image databases. Citizen science initiatives such as Galaxy Zoo showed that large datasets of galaxy images can be analyzed effectively by non-scientist volunteers, but since databases generated by robotic telescopes grow much faster than the processing power of any group of citizen scientists, it is clear that computer analysis is required. Here we propose to use citizen science data for training machine learning systems, and show experimental results demonstrating that machine learning systems can be trained with citizen science data. Our findings show that the performance of machine learning depends on the quality of the data, which can be improved by using samples that have a high degree of agreement between the citizen scientists.

When Human-Computer Interaction Meets Community Citizen Science,"Yen-Chia Hsu, Illah Nourbakhsh","Human-computer interaction (HCI) studies the design and use of interfaces and interactive systems. HCI has been adopted successfully in modern commercial products. Recently, its use for promoting social good and pursuing sustainability, known as sustainable HCI, has begun to receive wide attention. Conventionally, scientists and decision-makers apply top-down approaches to lead research activities that engage lay people in facilitating sustainability, such as saving energy. We introduce an alternative framework, Community Citizen Science (CCS), to closely connect research and social issues by empowering communities to produce scientific knowledge, represent their needs, address their concerns, and advocate for impact. CCS advances the current science-oriented concept to a deeper level that aims to sustain community engagement when researchers are no longer involved after the intervention of interactive systems.",2019-07-25T18:11:23Z,2019-07-25T18:11:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11260v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11260v1,cs.HC

They showed that the problem is decidable and EXPTIME-complete in the adversarial setting, and posed as an open problem the stochastic setting, where the agent is represented by a Markov decision process. In this paper, we show that the stochastic control problem is decidable.

Volume Conductor: Interactive Visibility Management for Crowded Volumes,"Žiga Lesar, Ruwayda Alharbi, Ciril Bohak, Ondřej Strnad, Christoph Heinzl, Matija Marolt, Ivan Viola","We present a novel smart visibility system for visualizing crowded volumetric data containing many object instances. The presented approach allows users to form groups of objects through membership predicates and to individually control the visibility of the instances in each group. Unlike previous smart visibility approaches, our approach controls the visibility on a per-instance basis and decides which instances are displayed or hidden based on the membership predicates and the current view. Thus, cluttered and dense volumes that are notoriously difficult to explore effectively are automatically sparsified so that the essential information is extracted and presented to the user. The proposed system is generic and can be easily integrated into existing volume rendering applications and applied to many different domains. We demonstrate the use of the volume conductor for visualizing fiber-reinforced polymers and intracellular organelle structures.",2022-06-15T08:55:33Z,2022-06-15T08:55:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07392v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07392v1,cs.GR

MaRe: a MapReduce-Oriented Framework for Processing Big Data with   Application Containers,"Marco Capuccini, Martin Dahlö, Salman Toor, Ola Spjuth","Background. Life science is increasingly driven by Big Data analytics, and the MapReduce programming model has been proven successful for data-intensive analyses. However, current MapReduce frameworks offer poor support for reusing existing processing tools in bioinformatics pipelines. Further, these frameworks do not have native support for application containers, which are becoming popular in scientific data processing.   Results. Here we present MaRe, a programming model with an associated open-source implementation, which introduces support for application containers in MapReduce. MaRe is based on Apache Spark and Docker, the MapReduce framework and container engine that have collected the largest open source community, thus providing interoperability with the cutting-edge software ecosystem. We demonstrate MaRe on two data-intensive applications in life science, showing ease of use and scalability.   Conclusions. MaRe enables scalable data-intensive processing in life science with MapReduce and application containers. When compared with current best practices, that involve the use of workflow systems, MaRe has the advantage of providing data locality, ingestion from heterogeneous storage systems and interactive processing.

Magnetic field driven quantum criticality in antiferromagnetic CePtIn4,"Debarchan Das, Daniel Gnida, Piotr Wiśniewski, Dariusz Kaczorowski","Physics of quantum critical point is one of the most perplexing topics in current condensed-matter physics. Its conclusive understanding is forestalled by the scarcity of experimental systems displaying novel aspects of quantum criticality. We present a comprehensive experimental evidence of a magnetic field tuned tricritical point separating paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic phases in novel compound CePtIn$_4$. Analyzing field variations of its magnetic susceptibility, magnetoresistance and specific heat at very low temperatures, we trace modifications of antiferromagnetic structure of the compound. Upon applying magnetic field of increasing strength, the system undergoes metamagnetic transitions which persist down to the lowest temperature investigated, exhibiting first-order-like boundaries separating magnetic phases. This yields a unique phase diagram where the second-order phase transition line terminates at a tricritical point followed by two first-order lines reaching quantum critical end points as $T\to$~0.

ALGAMES: A Fast Solver for Constrained Dynamic Games,"Simon Le Cleac'h, Mac Schwager, Zachary Manchester","Dynamic games are an effective paradigm for dealing with the control of multiple interacting actors. This paper introduces ALGAMES (Augmented Lagrangian GAME-theoretic Solver), a solver that handles trajectory optimization problems with multiple actors and general nonlinear state and input constraints. Its novelty resides in satisfying the first order optimality conditions with a quasi-Newton root-finding algorithm and rigorously enforcing constraints using an augmented Lagrangian formulation. We evaluate our solver in the context of autonomous driving on scenarios with a strong level of interactions between the vehicles. We assess the robustness of the solver using Monte Carlo simulations. It is able to reliably solve complex problems like ramp merging with three vehicles three times faster than a state-of-the-art DDP-based approach.

Cluster-based network modeling -- automated robust modeling of complex   dynamical systems,"Daniel Fernex, Bernd R.

Complex nonlinear dynamics govern many fields of science and engineering. Data-driven dynamic modeling often assumes a low-dimensional subspace or manifold for the state. We liberate ourselves from this assumption by proposing cluster-based network modeling (CNM) bridging machine learning, network science, and statistical physics. CNM only assumes smoothness of the dynamics in the state space, robustly describes short- and long-term behavior and is fully automatable as it does not rely on application-specific knowledge. CNM is demonstrated for the Lorenz attractor, ECG heartbeat signals, Kolmogorov flow, and a high-dimensional actuated turbulent boundary layer. Even the notoriously difficult modeling benchmark of rare events in the Kolmogorov flow is solved.

In the context of biological robots, we explore changes across concepts and previously distinct fields that are driven by recent advances in materials, information, and life sciences. Herein, each author provides their own perspective on the subject, framed by their own disciplinary training. We argue that as with computation, certain aspects of developmental biology and robotics are not tied to specific materials; rather, the consilience of these fields can help to shed light on issues of multi-scale control, self-assembly, and relationships between form and function.

Guide star centroids from these windows can be used to correct for vibrations and flexure. Another potential use for these windows is to perform localized resets at high cadence to prevent saturation and to minimize persistence from bright sources.

A Cyberpunk 2077 perspective on the prediction and understanding of   future technology,"Miguel Bordallo López, Constantino Álvarez Casado","Science fiction and video games have long served as valuable tools for envisioning and inspiring future technological advancements. This position paper investigates the potential of Cyberpunk 2077, a popular science fiction video game, to shed light on the future of technology, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence, edge computing, augmented humans, and biotechnology. By analyzing the game's portrayal of these technologies and their implications, we aim to understand the possibilities and challenges that lie ahead. We discuss key themes such as neurolink and brain-computer interfaces, multimodal recording systems, virtual and simulated reality, digital representation of the physical world, augmented and AI-based home appliances, smart clothing, and autonomous vehicles.

Algebraic Connectivity Characterization of Ensemble Random Hypergraphs,Shih-Yu Chang,"Random hypergraph is a broad concept used to describe probability distributions over hypergraphs, which are mathematical structures with applications in various fields, e.g., complex systems in physics, computer science, social sciences, and network science. Ensemble methods, on the other hand, are crucial both in physics and machine learning. In physics, ensemble theory helps bridge the gap between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, providing a statistical framework for understanding systems with a vast number of particles. In machine learning, ensemble methods are valuable because they improve predictive accuracy, reduce overfitting, lower prediction variance, mitigate bias, and capture complex relationships in data. However, there is limited research on applying ensemble methods to a set of random hypergraphs. This work aims to study the connectivity behavior of an ensemble of random hypergraphs. Specifically, it focuses on quantifying the random behavior of the algebraic connectivity of these ensembles through tail bounds. We utilize Laplacian tensors to represent these ensemble random hypergraphs and establish mathematical theorems, such as Courant-Fischer and Lieb-Seiringer theorems for tensors, to derive tail bounds for the algebraic connectivity. We derive three different tail bounds, i.e., Chernoff, Bennett, and Bernstein bounds, for the algebraic connectivity of ensemble hypergraphs with respect to different random hypergraphs assumptions.",2023-10-12T20:07:21Z,2023-10-12T20:07:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08700v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08700v1,"math.PR, math.CO"
What Large-Scale Publication and Citation Data Tell Us About   International Research Collaboration in Europe: Changing National Patterns in   Global Contexts,Marek Kwiek,"This study analyzes the unprecedented growth of international research collaboration (IRC) in Europe during the period 2009-2018 in terms of coauthorship and citation distribution of globally indexed publications. The results reveal the dynamics of this change, as growing IRC moves European systems away from institutional collaboration, with stable and strong national collaboration. Domestic output has remained flat. The growth in publications in major European systems is almost entirely attributable to internationally coauthored papers. A comparison of trends within the four complementary collaboration modes clearly reveals that the growth of European science is driven solely by internationally co-authored papers. With the emergence of global network science, which diminishes the role of national policies in IRC and foregrounds the role of scientists, the individual scientists willingness to collaborate internationally is central to advancing IRC in Europe. Scientists collaborate internationally when it enhances their academic prestige, scientific recognition, and access to research funding, as indicated by the credibility cycle, prestige maximization, and global science models.

Potential Pitfalls in Visual Models of Tipping Points -- And How to Fix   Them,"Jonathan Dechert, Svetlana Gurevich, Stefan Heusler","Visual models play a crucial role in both science and science communication. However, the distinction between mere analogies and mathematically sound graphical representations is not easy and can be misunderstood not only by laypeople but also within academic literature itself. Moreover, even when the graphical representation exactly corresponds to the mathematical model, its interpretation is often far from obvious. In this paper we discuss the ""potential landscape"" visualization commonly used for tipping points in the context of nonlinear dynamics and reveal potential pitfalls, in particular when distinguishing bifurcation induced tipping (B-tipping) from noise-induced tipping (N-tipping). We propose new visualization techniques for tipping dynamics, carefully distinguishing between B- and N-tipping as well as between single systems and ensembles of systems. Explicitly, we apply these visualizations both to molecular cell biology and to climate science in order to reveal the crucial differences in the interpretation of the visual models. We find that it is crucial to explicitly discuss the assumptions made within the visual model and to be aware of the risk of misinterpretation. Based on these findings, we propose as a next step to investigate individual mental models induced by these visualizations in the framework of empirical research.",2024-10-29T16:09:32Z,2024-10-29T16:09:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22171v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22171v1,physics.ed-ph

Political Actor Agent: Simulating Legislative System for Roll Call Votes   Prediction with Large Language Models,"Hao Li, Ruoyuan Gong, Hao Jiang","Predicting roll call votes through modeling political actors has emerged as a focus in quantitative political science and computer science. Widely used embedding-based methods generate vectors for legislators from diverse data sets to predict legislative behaviors. However, these methods often contend with challenges such as the need for manually predefined features, reliance on extensive training data, and a lack of interpretability. Achieving more interpretable predictions under flexible conditions remains an unresolved issue. This paper introduces the Political Actor Agent (PAA), a novel agent-based framework that utilizes Large Language Models to overcome these limitations. By employing role-playing architectures and simulating legislative system, PAA provides a scalable and interpretable paradigm for predicting roll-call votes. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also offers multi-view, human-understandable decision reasoning, providing new insights into political actor behaviors. We conducted comprehensive experiments using voting records from the 117-118th U.S. House of Representatives, validating the superior performance and interpretability of PAA.

Reliability and Safety Modeling of a Digital Feed Water Control System,"Shawkat S. Khairullah, Ahmed A. Mostfa",Much digital instrumentation and control systems embedded in the critical medical healthcare equipment aerospace devices and nuclear industry have obvious consequence of different failure modes. These failures can affect the behavior of the overall safety critical digital system and its ability to deliver its dependability attributes if any defected area that could be a hardware component or software code embedded inside the digital system is not detected and repaired appropriately. The safety and reliability analysis of safety critical systems can be accomplished with Markov modeling techniques which could express the dynamic and regenerative behavior of the digital control system. Certain states in the system represent system failure while others represent fault free behavior or correct operation in the presence of faults. This paper presents the development of a safety and reliability modeling of a digital feedwater control system using Markov based chain models. All the Markov states and the transitions between these states were assumed and calculated from the control logic for the digital control system. Finally based on the simulation results of modeling the digital feedwater control system the system does meet its reliability requirement with the probability of being in fully operational states is 0.99 over a 6 months time.,2019-09-12T21:20:12Z,2020-07-20T21:52:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07210v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07210v2,"eess.SY, cs.SY, eess.SP"
COSTARICA estimator for rollback-less systems handling in iterative   co-simulation algorithms,"Yohan Eguillon, Bruno Lacabanne, Damien Tromeur-Dervout","Co-simulation is widely used in the industry due to the emergence of modular dynamical models made up of interconnected, black-boxed systems. Several co-simulation algorithms have been developed, each with different properties and different levels of accuracy and robustness. Among them, the most accurate and reliable ones are the iterative ones, although they have a main drawback in common: the involved systems are required to be capable of rollback. The latter denotes the ability of a system to integrate over a co-simulation time step that has already been simulated. Non-rollback-capable system can only go forward in time and every integrated step is definitive. In practice, the industrial modelling and simulation platforms rarely produce rollback-capable systems. This paper proposes a solution that slightly changes the co-simulation methodology and that enables to use iterative co-simulation methods on a modular model which contains non-rollback-capable systems in case the latter represent ordinary differential equations. The idea is to replace such a system by a simplified version, which is used to estimate the results of the integrations instead of integrating the real system. Once the co-simulation method's surrogate iterations on these estimators predict the convergence on the co-simulation step, the non-rollback-capable systems genuinely integrate the step using the estimated solution on the other systems before moving forward, transforming the iterative co-simulation method into a non-iterative one.",2022-03-22T14:07:03Z,2022-10-19T14:19:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11752v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11752v3,"eess.SY, cs.CE, cs.NA, cs.SY, math.DS, math.NA, 65, 65L05, 68U20"

Quantum Decoherence from Adiabatic Entanglement,"C. P. Sun, D. L. Zhou, S. Yu, X. F.

In the adiabatic limit, it is shown that the wave function of the total system formed by the quantum system plus the large system can be factorized as an entangled state with correlation between adiabatic quantum states and quasi-classical motion configurations of the large system. In association with a novel viewpoint about quantum measurement, which has been directly verified by most recent experiments [e.g, S. Durr et.al, Nature 33, 359 (1998)], it is shown that the adiabatic entanglement is indeed responsible for the quantum decoherence and thus it can be regarded as a ""clean"" quantum measurement when the large system behaves as a classical object. The large system being taken respectively to be a macroscopically distinguishable spatial variable, a high spin system and a harmonic oscillator with a coherent initial state, three illustrations are present with their explicit solutions in this paper.",2000-01-19T09:03:45Z,2000-01-19T09:03:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0001068v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0001068v1,quant-ph

"Optimizing Scrip Systems: Efficiency, Crashes, Hoarders, and Altruists","Ian A. Kash, Eric J. Friedman, Joseph Y. Halpern","We discuss the design of efficient scrip systems and develop tools for empirically analyzing them. For those interested in the empirical study of scrip systems, we demonstrate how characteristics of agents in a system can be inferred from the equilibrium distribution of money. From the perspective of a system designer, we examine the effect of the money supply on social welfare and show that social welfare is maximized by increasing the money supply up to the point that the system experiences a ``monetary crash,'' where money is sufficiently devalued that no agent is willing to perform a service. We also examine the implications of the presence of altruists and hoarders on the performance of the system. While a small number of altruists may improve social welfare, too many can also cause the system to experience a monetary crash, which may be bad for social welfare. Hoarders generally decrease social welfare but, surprisingly, they also promote system stability by helping prevent monetary crashes. In addition, we provide new technical tools for analyzing and computing equilibria by showing that our model exhibits strategic complementarities, which implies that there exist equilibria in pure strategies that can be computed efficiently.",2007-05-28T21:14:04Z,2007-05-28T21:14:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4110v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.4110v1,cs.GT
Integrated Design and Implementation of Embedded Control Systems with   Scilab,"Longhua Ma, Feng Xia, Zhe Peng","Embedded systems are playing an increasingly important role in control engineering. Despite their popularity, embedded systems are generally subject to resource constraints and it is therefore difficult to build complex control systems on embedded platforms. Traditionally, the design and implementation of control systems are often separated, which causes the development of embedded control systems to be highly time-consuming and costly. To address these problems, this paper presents a low-cost, reusable, reconfigurable platform that enables integrated design and implementation of embedded control systems. To minimize the cost, free and open source software packages such as Linux and Scilab are used. Scilab is ported to the embedded ARM-Linux system. The drivers for interfacing Scilab with several communication protocols including serial, Ethernet, and Modbus are developed. Experiments are conducted to test the developed embedded platform. The use of Scilab enables implementation of complex control algorithms on embedded platforms.

Structured Operational Semantics for Graph Rewriting,"Andrei Dorman, Tobias Heindel","Process calculi and graph transformation systems provide models of reactive systems with labelled transition semantics. While the semantics for process calculi is compositional, this is not the case for graph transformation systems, in general. Hence, the goal of this article is to obtain a compositional semantics for graph transformation system in analogy to the structural operational semantics (SOS) for Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS).   The paper introduces an SOS style axiomatization of the standard labelled transition semantics for graph transformation systems. The first result is its equivalence with the so-called Borrowed Context technique. Unfortunately, the axiomatization is not compositional in the expected manner as no rule captures ""internal"" communication of sub-systems. The main result states that such a rule is derivable if the given graph transformation system enjoys a certain property, which we call ""complementarity of actions"". Archetypal examples of such systems are interaction nets. We also discuss problems that arise if ""complementarity of actions"" is violated.",2011-08-02T02:27:13Z,2011-08-02T02:27:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0465v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.0465v1,"cs.LO, cs.DC"
SMT-based Induction Methods for Timed Systems,"Roland Kindermann, Tommi Junttila, Ilkka Niemelä","Modeling time related aspects is important in many applications of verification methods. For precise results, it is necessary to interpret time as a dense domain, e.g. using timed automata as a formalism, even though the system's resulting infinite state space is challenging for verification methods. Furthermore, fully symbolic treatment of both timing related and non-timing related elements of the state space seems to offer an attractive approach to model checking timed systems with a large amount of non-determinism. This paper presents an SMT-based timed system extension to the IC3 algorithm, a SAT-based novel, highly efficient, complete verification method for untimed systems. Handling of the infinite state spaces of timed system in the extended IC3 algorithm is based on suitably adapting the well-known region abstraction for timed systems. Additionally, $k$-induction, another symbolic verification method for discrete time systems, is extended in a similar fashion to support timed systems.

Such a system is a multi-valued function f that assigns to an (admissible) input u:R{\to}{0,1}^{m} a set f(u) of (possible) states x:R{\to}{0,1}^{n}. When this assignment is defined by making use of a so-called generator function {\Phi}:{0,1}^{n}{\times}{0,1}^{m}{\to}{0,1}^{n}, then the asynchronous system f is called regular. The generator function {\Phi} acts in this asynchronous framework similarly with the next state function from a synchronous framework.

After describing how the adaptive traffic signal system can efficiently be used and showing its advantages over traffic signals with predetermined periods, we have shown how we can transform this scenario into Finite State Machine (FSM). Once the system is transformed into a FSM, we have verified the specifications specified in Computational Tree Logic(CTL) using NuSMV as a model checking tool. Simulation results obtained from NuSMV showed us whether the system satisfied the specifications or not. It has also showed us the state where the system specification does not hold.

Solar System Moons as Analogs for Compact Exoplanetary Systems,"Stephen R. Kane, Natalie R. Hinkel, Sean N. Raymond","The field of exoplanetary science has experienced a recent surge of new systems that is largely due to the precision photometry provided by the Kepler mission. The latest discoveries have included compact planetary systems in which the orbits of the planets all lie relatively close to the host star, which presents interesting challenges in terms of formation and dynamical evolution. The compact exoplanetary systems are analogous to the moons orbiting the giant planets in our Solar System, in terms of their relative sizes and semi-major axes. We present a study that quantifies the scaled sizes and separations of the Solar System moons with respect to their hosts. We perform a similar study for a large sample of confirmed Kepler planets in multi-planet systems. We show that a comparison between the two samples leads to a similar correlation between their scaled sizes and separation distributions. The different gradients of the correlations may be indicative of differences in the formation and/or long-term dynamics of moon and planetary systems.",2013-09-05T20:00:01Z,2013-09-05T20:00:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1467v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1467v1,astro-ph.EP
Multivalued Logic Circuit Design for Binary Logic Interface,"Hitesh Gupta, Dr. S. C. Jain","Binary logic and devices have been in used since inception with advancement and technology and millennium gate design era. The development in binary logic has become tedious and cumbersome. Multivalued logic enables significant more information to be packed within a single digit. The design and development of logic circuit becomes very compact and easier. Attempts are being made to fabricate multivalued logic based devices. Since present devices can be implemented only in binary system,it is necessary to evolve a system that can built the circuit in multivalued logic system and convert in binary logic system. In multivalued logic system logic gates differ in different logic system, a quaternary has become mature in terms of logic algebra and gates. Hence logic design based on above system can be done using standard procedure. In this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on multivalued logic system has been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in multivalued system and output as binary valued circuit.

Comprehensive Analysis and Measurement of Frequency-Tuned and   Impedance-Tuned Wireless Non-Radiative Power Transfer Systems,"Jason D. Heebl, Erin M. Thomas, Robert P. Penno, Anthony Grbic","This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates frequency-tuned and impedance-tuned wireless non-radiative power transfer (WNPT) systems. Closed-form expressions for the efficiencies of both systems, as a function of frequency and system (circuit) parameters, are presented. In the frequency-tuned system, the operating frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in mutual inductance that occur for variations of transmitter and receiver loop positions. Frequency-tuning is employed for a range of distances over which the loops are strongly coupled. In contrast, the impedance-tuned system employs varactor-based matching networks to compensate for changes in mutual inductance and achieve a simultaneous conjugate impedance match over a range of distances. The frequency-tuned system is simpler to implement, while the impedance-tuned system is more complex but can achieve higher efficiencies. Both of the experimental WNPT systems studied employ resonant shielded loops as transmitting and receiving devices.",2014-01-14T20:37:27Z,2014-01-14T20:37:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3324v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3324v1,cs.OH

Rantakyrö, Stephen J. Goodsell","The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is an ""extreme"" adaptive optics coronagraph system that is now on the Gemini South telescope in Chile. This instrument is composed of three different systems that historically have been separate instruments. These systems are the extreme Adaptive Optics system, with deformable mirrors, including a high-order 64x64 element MEMS system; the Science Instrument, which is a near-infrared integral field spectrograph; and the Calibration system, a precision IR wavefront sensor that also holds key coronagraph components. Each system coordinates actions that require precise timing. The observatory is responsible for starting these actions and has typically done this asynchronously across independent systems.

Improving Observability of Stochastic Complex Networks under the   Supervision of Cognitive Dynamic Systems,"Mehdi Fatemi, Peyman Setoodeh, Simon Haykin","Much has been said about observability in system theory and control; however, it has been recently that observability in complex networks has seriously attracted the attention of researchers. This paper examines the state-of-the-art and discusses some issues raised due to ""complexity"" and ""stochasticity"". These unresolved issues call for a new practical methodology. For stochastic systems, a degree of observability may be defined and the observability problem is not a binary (i.e., yes-no) question anymore. Here, we propose to employ a goal-seeking system to play a supervisory role in the network. Hence, improving the degree of observability would be a valid objective for the supervisory system. Towards this goal, the supervisor dynamically optimizes the observation process by reconfiguring the sensory parts in the network. A cognitive dynamic system is suggested as a proper choice for the supervisory system. In this framework, the network itself is viewed as the environment with which the cognitive dynamic system interacts. Computer experiments confirm the potential of the proposed approach for addressing some of the issues raised in networks due to complexity and stochasticity.",2014-11-07T20:17:09Z,2014-11-07T20:17:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6162v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6162v1,"cs.SY, math.OC"
Distributed Analysis for Diagnosability in Concurrent Systems,"Hernán Ponce de León, Gonzalo Bonigo, Laura Brandán Briones","Complex systems often exhibit unexpected faults that are difficult to handle. Such systems are desirable to be diagnosable, i.e. faults can be automatically detected as they occur (or shortly afterwards), enabling the system to handle the fault or recover. A system is diagnosable if it is possible to detect every fault, in a finite time after they occurred, by only observing the available information from the system. Complex systems are usually built from simpler components running concurrently. We study how to infer the diagnosability property of a complex system (distributed and with multiple faults) from a parallelized analysis of the diagnosability of each of its components synchronizing with fault free versions of the others.   In this paper we make the following contributions: (1) we address the diagnosability problem of concurrent systems with arbitrary faults occurring freely in each component. (2) We distribute the diagnosability analysis and illustrate our approach with examples. Moreover, (3) we present a prototype tool that implements our techniques showing promising results.",2015-02-26T08:30:41Z,2015-02-26T08:30:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07466v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07466v1,"cs.SE, cs.LO"
Call Graph Profiling for Multi Agent Systems,"Dinh Doan Van Bien, David Lillis, Rem W. Collier","The design, implementation and testing of Multi Agent Systems is typically a very complex task. While a number of specialist agent programming languages and toolkits have been created to aid in the development of such systems, the provision of associated development tools still lags behind those available for other programming paradigms. This includes tools such as debuggers and profilers to help analyse system behaviour, performance and efficiency. AgentSpotter is a profiling tool designed specifically to operate on the concepts of agent-oriented programming.

Proceedings Workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems,"Rob van Glabbeek, Jan Friso Groote, Peter Höfner","This volume contains the proceedings of MARS 2015, the first workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems, held on November 23, 2015 in Suva, Fiji, as an affiliated workshop of LPAR 2015, the 20th International Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning.   The workshop emphasises modelling over verification. It aims at discussing the lessons learned from making formal methods for the verification and analysis of realistic systems. Examples are:   (1) Which formalism is chosen, and why?   (2) Which abstractions have to be made and why?   (3) How are important characteristics of the system modelled?   (4) Were there any complications while modelling the system?   (5) Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?   We invited papers that present full models of real systems, which may lay the basis for future comparison and analysis. An aim of the workshop is to present different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them. Alternative formal descriptions of the systems presented at this workshop are encouraged, which should foster the development of improved specification formalisms.",2015-11-08T21:12:17Z,2015-11-08T21:12:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02528v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02528v1,"cs.LO, cs.CR, cs.OS, cs.SY"
Uniqueness of Normal Forms for Shallow Term Rewrite Systems,"Nicholas Radcliffe, Luis Moraes, Rakesh Verma","Uniqueness of normal forms ($UN^=$) is an important property of term rewrite systems. $UN^=$ is decidable for ground (i.e., variable-free) systems and undecidable in general. Recently it was shown to be decidable for linear, shallow systems. We generalize this previous result and show that this property is decidable for shallow rewrite systems, in contrast to confluence, reachability and other properties, which are all undecidable for flat systems. Our result is also optimal in some sense, since we prove that the $UN^=$ property is undecidable for two classes of linear rewrite systems: left-flat systems in which right-hand sides are of depth at most two and right-flat systems in which left-hand sides are of depth at most two.",2016-07-01T23:00:39Z,2016-07-01T23:00:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00431v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00431v1,"cs.LO, cs.FL"
Conditional symmetries and exact solutions of nonlinear   reaction-diffusion systems with non-constant diffusivities,"Roman Cherniha, Vasyl' Davydovych","Q-conditional symmetries (nonclassical symmetries) for the general class of two-component reaction-diffusion systems with non-constant diffusivities are studied. Using the recently introduced notion of Q-conditional symmetries of the first type, an exhausted list of reaction-diffusion systems admitting such symmetry is derived. The results obtained for the reaction-diffusion systems are compared with those for the scalar reaction-diffusion equations. The symmetries found for reducing reaction-diffusion systems to two-dimensional dynamical systems, i.e., ODE systems, and finding exact solutions are applied. As result, multiparameter families of exact solutions in the explicit form for a nonlinear reaction-diffusion system with an arbitrary diffusivity are constructed. Finally, the application of the exact solutions for solving a biologically and physically motivated system is presented.",2016-09-30T06:04:18Z,2016-09-30T06:04:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09607v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09607v1,"math-ph, math.MP"

More precisely, we show that every weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting system can be converted to an equivalent weakly-left-linear and ultra-weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting system and prove that the SR transformation is sound for weakly-left-linear and ultra-weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting systems.

Optimal Control of Hybrid Optomechanical Systems for Generating   Non-Classical States of Mechanical Motion,"Ville Bergholm, Witlef Wieczorek, Thomas Schulte-Herbrueggen, Michael Keyl","Cavity optomechanical systems are one of the leading experimental platforms for controlling mechanical motion in the quantum regime. We exemplify that the control over cavity optomechanical systems greatly increases by coupling the cavity also to a two-level system, thereby creating a hybrid optomechanical system. If the two-level system can be driven largely independently of the cavity, we show that the non-linearity thus introduced enables us to steer the extended system to non-classical target states of the mechanical oscillator with Wigner functions exhibiting significant negative regions. We illustrate how to use optimal control techniques beyond the linear regime to drive the hybrid system from the near ground state into a Fock target state of the mechanical oscillator. We base our numerical optimization on realistic experimental parameters for exemplifying how optimal control enables the preparation of decidedly non-classical target states, where naive control schemes fail. Our results thus pave the way for applying the toolbox of optimal control in hybrid optomechanical systems for generating non-classical mechanical states.",2018-12-14T17:32:24Z,2019-05-04T09:36:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06042v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06042v2,quant-ph
A re-formulization of the transfer matrix method for calculating   wave-functions in higher dimensional disordered open systems,"Liang Chen, Cheng Lv, Xunya Jiang","We present a numerically stable re-formulization of the transfer matrix method (TMM). The iteration form of the traditional TMM is transformed into solving a set of linear equations. Our method gains the new ability of calculating accurate wave-functions of higher dimensional disordered systems. It also shows higher efficiency than the traditional TMM when treating finite systems. In contrast to the diagonalization method, our method not only provides a new route for calculating the wave-function corresponding to the boundary conditions of open systems in realistic transport experiments, but also has advantages that the calculating wave energy/frequency can be tuned continuously and the efficiency is much higher. Our new method is further used to identify the necklace state in the two dimensional disordered Anderson model, where it shows advantage in cooperating the wave-functions with the continuous transmission spectrum of open systems. The new formulization is very simple to implement and can be readily generalized to various systems such as spin-orbit coupling systems or optical systems.",2019-12-25T14:05:00Z,2019-12-25T14:05:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11672v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11672v1,"physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.CE"

Comparative Analysis of Power System Model Reduction,"Mohammad Khatibi, Fatemeh Rahmani, Tanushree Agarwal","This paper presents the modal truncation and singular value decomposition (SVD) technique as two main algorithms for dynamic model reduction of the power system. The significance and accuracy of the proposed methods are investigated with their detailed formulation derived for a constrained linear system. The full linearized model of the original nonlinear system is determined and used as the input of the dynamic reduction technique. Therefore, the variables of a synchronous machine in a multi-machine system is studied and replaced with a much simpler dynamic model. This equivalent dynamic model should behave similarly to what is observed from the system under study. The capability of each technique in keeping dominant oscillation modes after dynamic reduction is utilized as the comparison criteria.

A Deontic Logic Analysis of Autonomous Systems' Safety,"Colin Shea-Blymyer, Houssam Abbas","We consider the pressing question of how to model, verify, and ensure that autonomous systems meet certain \textit{obligations} (like the obligation to respect traffic laws), and refrain from impermissible behavior (like recklessly changing lanes). Temporal logics are heavily used in autonomous system design; however, as we illustrate here, temporal (alethic) logics alone are inappropriate for reasoning about obligations of autonomous systems. This paper proposes the use of Dominance Act Utilitarianism (DAU), a deontic logic of agency, to encode and reason about obligations of autonomous systems. We use DAU to analyze Intel's Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) proposal as a real-world case study. We demonstrate that DAU can express well-posed RSS rules, formally derive undesirable consequences of these rules, illustrate how DAU could help design systems that have specific obligations, and how to model-check DAU obligations.",2020-09-01T22:56:15Z,2020-09-01T22:56:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00738v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00738v1,"cs.LO, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Sensor Placement for Online Fault Diagnosis,"Dhananjay Raju, Georgios Bakirtzis, Ufuk Topcu","Fault diagnosis is the problem of determining a set of faulty system components that explain discrepancies between observed and expected behavior. Due to the intrinsic relation between observations and sensors placed on a system, sensors' fault diagnosis and placement are mutually dependent. Consequently, it is imperative to solve the fault diagnosis and sensor placement problems jointly. One approach to modeling systems for fault diagnosis uses answer set programming (ASP). We present a model-based approach to sensor placement for active diagnosis using ASP, where the secondary objective is to reduce the number of sensors used. The proposed method finds locations for system sensors with around 500 components in a few minutes. To address larger systems, we propose a notion of modularity such that it is possible to treat each module as a separate system and solve the sensor placement problem for each module independently. Additionally, we provide a fixpoint algorithm for determining the modules of a system.",2022-11-21T18:58:49Z,2022-11-21T18:58:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11741v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11741v1,"eess.SY, cs.LO, cs.SY"
EPTL - A temporal logic for weakly consistent systems,"Mathias Weber, Annette Bieniusa, Arnd Poetzsch-Heffter","The high availability and scalability of weakly-consistent systems attracts system designers. Yet, writing correct application code for this type of systems is difficult; even how to specify the intended behavior of such systems is still an open question. There has not been established any standard method to specify the intended dynamic behavior of a weakly consistent system. There exist specifications of various consistency models for distributed and concurrent systems; and the semantics of replicated datatypes like CRDTs have been specified in axiomatic and operational models based on visibility relations.   In this paper, we present a temporal logic, EPTL, that is tailored to specify properties of weakly consistent systems. In contrast to LTL and CTL, EPTL takes into account that operations of weakly consistent systems are in many cases not serializable and have to be treated respectively to capture the behavior.

Classification of topological phases in one dimensional interacting   non-Hermitian systems and emergent unitarity,"Wenjie Xi, Zhi-Hao Zhang, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Wei-Qiang Chen","Topological phases in non-Hermitian systems have become fascinating subjects recently. In this paper, we attempt to classify topological phases in 1D interacting non-Hermitian systems. We begin with the non-Hermitian generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and discuss its many-body topological Berry phase, which is well defined for all interacting quasi-Hermitian systems (non-Hermitian systems that have real energy spectrum). We then demonstrate that the classification of topological phases for quasi-Hermitian systems is exactly the same as their Hermitian counterparts. Finally, we construct the fixed point partition function for generic 1D interacting non-Hermitian local systems and find that the fixed point partition function still has a one-to-one correspondence to their Hermitian counterparts. Thus, we conclude that the classification of topological phases for generic 1D interacting non-Hermitian systems is still exactly the same as Hermitian systems.",2019-11-05T03:15:20Z,2021-05-17T04:25:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01590v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01590v6,cond-mat.str-el
Controller Synthesis of Wind Turbine Generator and Energy Storage System   with Stochastic Wind Variations under Temporal Logic Specifications,"Zhe Xu, Agung Julius, Ufuk Topcu, Joe H.

The MTL specifications are requirements for the grid frequency deviations, WTG rotor speed variations and the power flow constraints at different lines. We present the stochastic control bisimulation function, which bounds the divergence of the trajectories of a switched stochastic control system and the switched nominal control system in a probabilistic fashion.We first design a feedforward controller by solving an optimization problem for the nominal trajectory of the deterministic control system with robustness against initial state variations and stochastic uncertainties. Then we generate a feedback control law from the data of the simulated trajectories.

A Distributed Scheme for Stability Assessment in Large-Scale   Structure-Preserving Models via Singular Perturbation,"Amin Gholami, Xu Andy Sun","Assessing small-signal stability of power systems composed of thousands of interacting generators is a computationally challenging task. To reduce the computational burden, this paper introduces a novel condition to assess and certify small-signal stability. Using this certificate, we can see the impact of network topology and system parameters (generators' damping and inertia) on the eigenvalues of the system. The proposed certificate is derived from rigorous analysis of the classical structure-preserving swing equation model and has a physically insightful interpretation related to the generators' parameters and reactive power. To develop the certificate, we use singular perturbation techniques, and in the process, we establish the relationship between the structure-preserving model and its singular perturbation counterpart. As the proposed method is fully distributed and uses only local measurements, its computational cost does not increase with the size of the system. The effectiveness of the scheme is numerically illustrated on the WSCC system.",2021-03-29T05:01:52Z,2021-03-29T05:01:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15333v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15333v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.DS"
Wigner-Smith Time Delay Matrix for Electromagnetics: Systems with   Material Dispersion and Losses,"Yiqian Mao, Utkarsh R.

For systems composed of nondispersive and lossless materials, the WS time delay matrix previously was shown to consist of volume integrals of energy-like densities plus correction terms that account for the guiding, scattering, or radiating characteristics of the system. This study extends the use of the WS time delay matrix to systems composed of dispersive and lossy materials. Specifically, it shows that such systems' WS time delay matrix can be expressed by augmenting the previously derived expressions with terms that account for the dispersive and lossy nature of the system, followed by a transformation that disentangles effects of losses from time delays. Analytical and numerical examples demonstrate the new formulation once again allows for the construction of frequency stable WS modes that experience well-defined group delays upon interacting with a system.",2022-06-03T06:23:21Z,2022-06-03T06:23:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01403v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01403v1,"physics.comp-ph, cs.CE"

Ours is the first cyclic proof system for a higher-order logic, to our knowledge. Due to the presence of higher-order predicates and alternating fixed-points, our cyclic proof system requires a more delicate global condition on cyclic proofs than the original system of Brotherston and Simpson. We prove the decidability of checking the global condition and soundness of this system, and also prove a restricted form of standard completeness for an infinitary variant of our cyclic proof system. A potential application of our cyclic proof system is semi-automated verification of higher-order programs, based on Kobayashi et al.'s recent work on reductions from program verification to HFLN validity checking.",2020-10-28T11:19:53Z,2021-08-12T07:22:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14891v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14891v3,"cs.LO, cs.CL, 03B70"
TEMPEST -- Synthesis Tool for Reactive Systems and Shields in   Probabilistic Environments,"Stefan Pranger, Bettina Könighofer, Lukas Posch, Roderick Bloem","We present Tempest, a synthesis tool to automatically create correct-by-construction reactive systems and shields from qualitative or quantitative specifications in probabilistic environments. A shield is a special type of reactive system used for run-time enforcement; i.e., a shield enforces a given qualitative or quantitative specification of a running system while interfering with its operation as little as possible. Shields that enforce a qualitative or quantitative specification are called safety-shields or optimal-shields, respectively. Safety-shields can be implemented as pre-shields or as post-shields, optimal-shields are implemented as post-shields. Pre-shields are placed before the system and restrict the choices of the system. Post-shields are implemented after the system and are able to overwrite the system's output. Tempest is based on the probabilistic model checker Storm, adding model checking algorithms for stochastic games with safety and mean-payoff objectives. To the best of our knowledge, Tempest is the only synthesis tool able to solve 2-1/2-player games with mean-payoff objectives without restrictions on the state space. Furthermore, Tempest adds the functionality to synthesize safe and optimal strategies that implement reactive systems and shields",2021-05-26T14:43:29Z,2021-05-26T14:43:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12588v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12588v1,cs.LO
Architecture and Its Vulnerabilities in Smart-Lighting Systems,"Florian Hofer, Barbara Russo","Industry 4.0 embodies one of the significant technological changes of this decade. Cyber-physical systems and the Internet Of Things are two central technologies in this change that embed or connect with sensors and actuators and interact with the physical environment. However, such systems-of-systems undergo additional restrictions in an endeavor to maintain reliability and security when building and interconnecting components to a heterogeneous, multi-domain \textit{Smart-*} systems architecture. This paper presents an application-specific, layer-based approach to an offline security analysis inspired by design science that merges preceding expertise from relevant domains.

Automatic Repair and Deadlock Detection for Parameterized Systems,"Swen Jacobs, Mouhammad Sakr, Marcus Völp","We present an algorithm for the repair of parameterized systems. The repair problem is, for a given process implementation, to find a refinement such that a given safety property is satisfied by the resulting parameterized system, and deadlocks are avoided. Our algorithm uses a parameterized model checker to determine the correctness of candidate solutions and employs a constraint system to rule out candidates. We apply this algorithm on systems that can be represented as well-structured transition systems (WSTS), including disjunctive systems, pairwise rendezvous systems, and broadcast protocols. Moreover, we show that parameterized deadlock detection can be decided in EXPTIME for disjunctive systems, and that deadlock detection is in general undecidable for broadcast protocols.",2021-11-05T08:46:22Z,2022-07-28T13:49:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03322v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03322v3,cs.LO
Terrestrial planet formation from lost inner solar system material,"Christoph Burkhardt, Fridolin Spitzer, Alessandro Morbidelli, Gerrit Budde, Jan H. Render, Thomas S. Kruijer, Thorsten Kleine","Two fundamentally different processes of rocky planet formation exist, but it is unclear which one built the terrestrial planets of the solar system. Either they formed by collisions among planetary embryos from the inner solar system, or by accreting sunward-drifting millimeter-sized 'pebbles' from the outer solar system. We show that the isotopic compositions of Earth and Mars are governed by two-component mixing among inner solar system materials, including material from the innermost disk unsampled by meteorites, whereas the contribution of outer solar system material is limited to a few percent by mass. This refutes a pebble accretion origin of the terrestrial planets, but is consistent with collisional growth from inner solar system embryos. The low fraction of outer solar system material in Earth and Mars indicates the presence of a persistent dust-drift barrier in the disk, highlighting the specific pathway of rocky planet formation in the solar system.",2022-01-20T09:44:53Z,2022-01-20T09:44:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08092v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08092v1,astro-ph.EP
On the solvability of weakly linear systems of fuzzy relation equations,"Stefan Stanimirovic, Ivana Micic","Systems of fuzzy relation equations and inequalities in which an unknown fuzzy relation is on the one side of the equation or inequality are linear systems. They are the most studied ones, and a vast literature on linear systems focuses on finding solutions and solvability criteria for such systems. The situation is quite different with the so-called weakly linear systems, in which an unknown fuzzy relation is on both sides of the equation or inequality. Precisely, the scholars have only given the characterization of the set of exact solutions to such systems. This paper describes the set of fuzzy relations that solve weakly linear systems to a certain degree and provides ways to compute them. We pay special attention to developing the algorithms for computing fuzzy preorders and fuzzy equivalences that are solutions to some extent to weakly linear systems. We establish additional properties for the set of such approximate solutions over some particular types of complete residuated lattices. We demonstrate the advantage of this approach via many examples that arise from the problem of aggregation of fuzzy networks.",2022-05-25T16:59:48Z,2022-05-25T16:59:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15292v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15292v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LO"
Network structural origin of instabilities in large complex systems,"Chao Duan, Takashi Nishikawa, Deniz Eroglu, Adilson E. Motter","A central issue in the study of large complex network systems, such as power grids, financial networks, and ecological systems, is to understand their response to dynamical perturbations. Recent studies recognize that many real networks show nonnormality and that nonnormality can give rise to reactivity--the capacity of a linearly stable system to amplify its response to perturbations, oftentimes exciting nonlinear instabilities. Here, we identify network structural properties underlying the pervasiveness of nonnormality and reactivity in real directed networks, which we establish using the most extensive data set of such networks studied in this context to date. The identified properties are imbalances between incoming and outgoing network links and paths at each node. Based on this characterization, we develop a theory that quantitatively predicts nonnormality and reactivity and explains the observed pervasiveness. We suggest that these results can be used to design, upgrade, control, and manage networks to avoid or promote network instabilities.",2022-07-15T18:02:26Z,2022-07-19T16:03:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07680v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07680v2,"nlin.AO, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.DS, q-bio.MN"
Bayesian Formal Synthesis of Unknown Systems via Robust Simulation   Relations,"Oliver Schön, Birgit van Huijgevoort, Sofie Haesaert, Sadegh Soudjani","This paper addresses the problem of data-driven computation of controllers that are correct by design for safety-critical systems and can provably satisfy (complex) functional requirements. With a focus on continuous-space stochastic systems with parametric uncertainty, we propose a two-stage approach that decomposes the problem into a learning stage and a robust formal controller synthesis stage. The first stage utilizes available Bayesian regression results to compute robust credible sets for the true parameters of the system. For the second stage, we introduce methods for systems subject to both stochastic and parametric uncertainties. We provide simulation relations for enabling correct-by-design control refinement that are founded on coupling uncertainties of stochastic systems via sub-probability measures. The presented relations are essential for constructing abstract models that are related to not only one model but to a set of parameterized models. The results are demonstrated on three case studies, including a nonlinear and a high-dimensional system.",2023-04-14T23:29:04Z,2024-02-12T11:12:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07428v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07428v2,"eess.SY, cs.LO, cs.SY"
Logipedia: a multi-system encyclopedia of formal proofs,"Gilles Dowek, François Thiré","Libraries of formal proofs are an important part of our mathematical heritage, but their usability and sustainability is poor. Indeed, each library is specific to a proof system, sometimes even to some version of this system. Thus, a library developed in one system cannot, in general, be used in another and when the system is no more maintained, the library may be lost. This impossibility of using a proof developed in one system in another has been noted for long and a remediation has been proposed: as we have empirical evidence that most of the formal proofs developed in one of these systems can also be developed in another, we can develop a standard language, in which these proofs can be translated, and then used in all systems supporting this standard. Logipedia is an attempt to build such a multi-system online encyclopedia of formal proofs expressed in such as standard language. It is based on two main ideas: the use of a logical framework and of reverse mathematics.",2023-04-06T15:28:13Z,2023-04-06T15:28:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00064v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00064v1,cs.LO
Game-Theoretical Analysis of Reviewer Rewards in Peer-Review Journal   Systems: Analysis and Experimental Evaluation using Deep Reinforcement   Learning,Minhyeok Lee,"In this paper, we navigate the intricate domain of reviewer rewards in open-access academic publishing, leveraging the precision of mathematics and the strategic acumen of game theory. We conceptualize the prevailing voucher-based reviewer reward system as a two-player game, subsequently identifying potential shortcomings that may incline reviewers towards binary decisions. To address this issue, we propose and mathematically formalize an alternative reward system with the objective of mitigating this bias and promoting more comprehensive reviews. We engage in a detailed investigation of the properties and outcomes of both systems, employing rigorous game-theoretical analysis and deep reinforcement learning simulations. Our results underscore a noteworthy divergence between the two systems, with our proposed system demonstrating a more balanced decision distribution and enhanced stability. This research not only augments the mathematical understanding of reviewer reward systems, but it also provides valuable insights for the formulation of policies within journal review system. Our contribution to the mathematical community lies in providing a game-theoretical perspective to a real-world problem and in the application of deep reinforcement learning to simulate and understand this complex system.",2023-05-20T04:13:35Z,2023-05-20T04:13:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12088v1,"cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.LG, econ.TH"
CrystalGPT: Enhancing system-to-system transferability in   crystallization prediction and control using time-series-transformers,"Niranjan Sitapure, Joseph S. Kwon","For prediction and real-time control tasks, machine-learning (ML)-based digital twins are frequently employed. However, while these models are typically accurate, they are custom-designed for individual systems, making system-to-system (S2S) transferability difficult. This occurs even when substantial similarities exist in the process dynamics across different chemical systems. To address this challenge, we developed a novel time-series-transformer (TST) framework that exploits the powerful transfer learning capabilities inherent in transformer algorithms. This was demonstrated using readily available process data obtained from different crystallizers operating under various operational scenarios. Using this extensive dataset, we trained a TST model (CrystalGPT) to exhibit remarkable S2S transferability not only across all pre-established systems, but also to an unencountered system. CrystalGPT achieved a cumulative error across all systems, which is eight times superior to that of existing ML models. Additionally, we coupled CrystalGPT with a predictive controller to reduce the variance in setpoint tracking to just 1%.",2023-05-31T12:34:16Z,2023-05-31T12:34:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03099v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03099v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG, J.2; I.6.5; I.2.6"

Information content and maximum entropy of compartmental systems in   equilibrium,"Holger Metzler, Carlos A. Sierra","Although compartmental dynamical systems are used in many different areas of science, model selection based on the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) is challenging because of the lack of methods for quantifying the entropy for this type of systems. Here, we take advantage of the interpretation of compartmental systems as continuous-time Markov chains to obtain entropy measures that quantify model information content. In particular, we quantify the uncertainty of a single particle's path as it travels through the system as described by path entropy and entropy rates. Path entropy measures the uncertainty of the entire path of a traveling particle from its entry into the system until its exit, whereas entropy rates measure the average uncertainty of the instantaneous future of a particle while it is in the system. We derive explicit formulas for these two types of entropy for compartmental systems in equilibrium based on Shannon information entropy and show how they can be used to solve equifinality problems in the process of model selection by means of MaxEnt.",2023-08-21T18:02:18Z,2023-08-21T18:02:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10956v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10956v1,"cs.IT, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.DS, math.IT"
A Reliable Replication Strategy for VoD System using Markov Chain,"R. Ashok Kumar, K. Ganesan","In this paper we have investigated on the reliability of streams for a VoD system.

Hence, we proposed a new data replication technique to optimally store the videos in the peers. The new data replication technique generates more number of replicas than the existing techniques such as random, minimum request and maximize hit. We have also investigated by applying the CTMC model for the reliability of replications during the peer failures. Our result shows that the mean lifetime of replicas are more under various circumstances.

Computing the speed of convergence of ergodic averages and pseudorandom   points in computable dynamical systems,"Stefano Galatolo, Mathieu Hoyrup, Cristóbal Rojas","A pseudorandom point in an ergodic dynamical system over a computable metric space is a point which is computable but its dynamics has the same statistical behavior as a typical point of the system.   It was proved in [Avigad et al. 2010, Local stability of ergodic averages] that in a system whose dynamics is computable the ergodic averages of computable observables converge effectively. We give an alternative, simpler proof of this result.   This implies that if also the invariant measure is computable then the pseudorandom points are a set which is dense (hence nonempty) on the support of the invariant measure.",2010-06-02T14:29:58Z,2010-06-02T14:29:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0392v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.0392v1,"cs.NA, cs.CE, cs.LO, G.0; G.3"
Modularity of Convergence and Strong Convergence in Infinitary Rewriting,Stefan Michael Kahrs,"Properties of Term Rewriting Systems are called modular iff they are preserved under (and reflected by) disjoint union, i.e. when combining two Term Rewriting Systems with disjoint signatures.

Strong Convergence requires in addition that redex positions in a reduction sequence move arbitrarily deep.

Towards the Development of a Simulator for Investigating the Impact of   People Management Practices on Retail Performance,"Peer-Olaf Siebers, Uwe Aickelin, Helen Celia, Chris Clegg","Often models for understanding the impact of management practices on retail performance are developed under the assumption of stability, equilibrium and linearity, whereas retail operations are considered in reality to be dynamic, non-linear and complex. Alternatively, discrete event and agent-based modelling are approaches that allow the development of simulation models of heterogeneous non-equilibrium systems for testing out different scenarios. When developing simulation models one has to abstract and simplify from the real world, which means that one has to try and capture the 'essence' of the system required for developing a representation of the mechanisms that drive the progression in the real system. Simulation models can be developed at different levels of abstraction. To know the appropriate level of abstraction for a specific application is often more of an art than a science.

In the usual semantics of process algebras for modelling biological systems actions are instantaneous. When different scale levels of biological systems are considered in a single model, one should take into account that actions at a level may take much more time than actions at a lower level. Moreover, it might happen that while a component is involved in one long lasting high level action, it is involved also in several faster lower level actions. Hence, we propose a process algebra with operations and with a semantics aimed at dealing with these aspects of multiscale modelling.

Symbolic and Asynchronous Semantics via Normalized Coalgebras,"Filippo Bonchi, Ugo Montanari","The operational semantics of interactive systems is usually described by labeled transition systems. Abstract semantics (that is defined in terms of bisimilarity) is characterized by the final morphism in some category of coalgebras. Since the behaviour of interactive systems is for many reasons infinite, symbolic semantics were introduced as a mean to define smaller, possibly finite, transition systems, by employing symbolic actions and avoiding some sources of infiniteness. Unfortunately, symbolic bisimilarity has a different shape with respect to ordinary bisimilarity, and thus the standard coalgebraic characterization does not work. In this paper, we introduce its coalgebraic models. We will use as motivating examples two asynchronous formalisms: open Petri nets and asynchronous pi-calculus. Indeed, as we have shown in a previous paper, asynchronous bisimilarity can be seen as an instance of symbolic bisimilarity.",2011-03-02T14:19:42Z,2011-05-13T10:58:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0437v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.0437v2,"cs.LO, F.3.2"

Central to the discussion is the formulation of a class of invariant measures supported on the survivor set over which we take the supremum to measure the pressure. Upper bounds for escape rates are proved for general diffeomorphisms of manifolds, possibly with singularities, for arbitrary holes and natural initial distributions including Lebesgue and SRB measures. Lower bounds do not hold in such generality, but for systems admitting Markov tower extensions with spectral gaps, we prove the equality of the escape rate with the absolute value of the pressure and the existence of an invariant measure realizing the escape rate, i.e. we prove a full variational principle.

So, it is indispensable to develop techniques of verifying and debugging quantum cryptographic systems. Model-checking has proved to be effective in the verification of classical cryptographic protocols, but an essential difficulty arises when it is applied to quantum systems: the state space of a quantum system is always a continuum even when its dimension is finite. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel notion of quantum Markov chain, specially suited to model quantum cryptographic protocols, in which quantum effects are entirely encoded into super-operators labelling transitions, leaving the location information (nodes) being classical.

"Complex Systems Science: Dreams of Universality, Reality of   Interdisciplinarity","Sebastian Grauwin, Guillaume Beslon, Eric Fleury, Sara Franceschelli, Céline Robardet, Jean-Baptiste Rouquier, Pablo Jensen","Using a large database (~ 215 000 records) of relevant articles, we empirically study the ""complex systems"" field and its claims to find universal principles applying to systems in general. The study of references shared by the papers allows us to obtain a global point of view on the structure of this highly interdisciplinary field. We show that its overall coherence does not arise from a universal theory but instead from computational techniques and fruitful adaptations of the idea of self-organization to specific systems. We also find that communication between different disciplines goes through specific ""trading zones"", ie sub-communities that create an interface around specific tools (a DNA microchip) or concepts (a network).",2012-06-11T14:20:32Z,2012-06-11T14:20:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2216v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2216v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.DL"
A Complete Axiom System for Propositional Interval Temporal Logic with   Infinite Time,Ben Moszkowski,"Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) is an established temporal formalism for reasoning about time periods. For over 25 years, it has been applied in a number of ways and several ITL variants, axiom systems and tools have been investigated. We solve the longstanding open problem of finding a complete axiom system for basic quantifier-free propositional ITL (PITL) with infinite time for analysing nonterminating computational systems. Our completeness proof uses a reduction to completeness for PITL with finite time and conventional propositional linear-time temporal logic. Unlike completeness proofs of equally expressive logics with nonelementary computational complexity, our semantic approach does not use tableaux, subformula closures or explicit deductions involving encodings of omega automata and nontrivial techniques for complementing them. We believe that our result also provides evidence of the naturalness of interval-based reasoning.",2012-07-16T20:25:50Z,2012-08-10T09:46:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3816v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.3816v2,"cs.LO, F.4.1, F.3.1"
A Provenance Tracking Model for Data Updates,"Gabriel Ciobanu, Ross Horne","For data-centric systems, provenance tracking is particularly important when the system is open and decentralised, such as the Web of Linked Data. In this paper, a concise but expressive calculus which models data updates is presented. The calculus is used to provide an operational semantics for a system where data and updates interact concurrently. The operational semantics of the calculus also tracks the provenance of data with respect to updates. This provides a new formal semantics extending provenance diagrams which takes into account the execution of processes in a concurrent setting. Moreover, a sound and complete model for the calculus based on ideals of series-parallel DAGs is provided. The notion of provenance introduced can be used as a subjective indicator of the quality of data in concurrent interacting systems.",2012-08-22T22:00:51Z,2012-08-22T22:00:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4634v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.4634v1,"cs.DC, cs.DB, F.1.2"

Gaia's primary science goal is to determine the kinematics, chemical structure and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy. In addition to this core science goal, the Gaia space mission is expected to discover thousands of Solar System Objects. Because of orbital constraints Gaia will only have a limited opportunity for astrometric follow-up of these discoveries. In 2010, the Gaia consortium DPAC initiated a program to identify ground-based optical telescopes for a Gaia follow-up network for Solar System Objects to perform the following critical tasks: confirmation of discovery, identification of body, object tracking to constrain orbits. To date this network comprises 37 observing sites (representing 53 instruments). The Zadko Telescope, located in Western Australia, was highlighted as an important network node because of its southern location, longitude and automated scheduling system.

Generic Regular Decompositions for Generic Zero-Dimensional Systems,"Xiaoxian Tang, Zhenghong Chen, Bican Xia","Two new concepts, generic regular decomposition and regular-decomposition-unstable (RDU) variety for generic zero-dimensional systems, are introduced in this paper and an algorithm is proposed for computing a generic regular decomposition and the associated RDU variety of a given generic zero-dimensional system simultaneously. The solutions of the given system can be expressed by finitely many zero-dimensional regular chains if the parameter value is not on the RDU variety.   The so called weakly relatively simplicial decomposition plays a crucial role in the algorithm, which is based on the theories of subresultant chains. Furthermore, the algorithm can be naturally adopted to compute a non-redundant Wu's decomposition and the decomposition is stable at any parameter value that is not on the RDU variety. The algorithm has been implemented with Maple 15 and experimented with a number of benchmarks from the literature. Empirical results are also presented to show the good performance of the algorithm.",2012-08-30T08:43:38Z,2013-01-16T03:16:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6112v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.6112v4,cs.SC
Model Checking the Quantitative mu-Calculus on Linear Hybrid Systems,"Diana Fischer, Lukasz Kaiser","We study the model-checking problem for a quantitative extension of the modal mu-calculus on a class of hybrid systems. Qualitative model checking has been proved decidable and implemented for several classes of systems, but this is not the case for quantitative questions that arise naturally in this context. Recently, quantitative formalisms that subsume classical temporal logics and allow the measurement of interesting quantitative phenomena were introduced. We show how a powerful quantitative logic, the quantitative mu-calculus, can be model checked with arbitrary precision on initialised linear hybrid systems. To this end, we develop new techniques for the discretisation of continuous state spaces based on a special class of strategies in model-checking games and present a reduction to a class of counter parity games.",2012-09-08T18:22:30Z,2012-09-19T09:08:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1738v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.1738v2,"cs.LO, D.2.4, F.4.1"
A Data Warehouse Design for a Typical University Information System,Youssef Bassil,"Presently, large enterprises rely on database systems to manage their data and information. These databases are useful for conducting daily business transactions. However, the tight competition in the marketplace has led to the concept of data mining in which data are analyzed to derive effective business strategies and discover better ways in carrying out business. In order to perform data mining, regular databases must be converted into what so called informational databases also known as data warehouse. This paper presents a design model for building data warehouse for a typical university information system. It is based on transforming an operational database into an informational warehouse useful for decision makers to conduct data analysis, predication, and forecasting. The proposed model is based on four stages of data migration: Data extraction, data cleansing, data transforming, and data indexing and loading. The complete system is implemented under MS Access 2010 and is meant to serve as a repository of data for data mining operations.",2012-12-10T14:09:03Z,2012-12-10T14:09:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2071v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.2071v1,cs.DB

Our measurements of the collective spin evolution reveal signatures of many-body dynamics, including beyond-mean-field effects. We derive a many-body Hamiltonian that describes the experimental observation of severely distorted lineshapes, atomic spin coherence decay, density-dependent frequency shifts, and correlated quantum spin noise.

Formation of Regular Satellites from Ancient Massive Rings in the Solar   System,"A. Crida, S. Charnoz","When a planetary tidal disk -like Saturn's rings- spreads beyond the Roche radius (inside which planetary tides prevent aggregation), satellites form and migrate away. Here, we show that most regular satellites in the solar system probably formed in this way. According to our analytical model, when the spreading is slow, a retinue of satellites appear with masses increasing with distance to the Roche radius, in excellent agreement with Saturn's, Uranus', and Neptune's satellite systems. This suggests that Uranus and Neptune used to have massive rings that disappeared to give birth to most of their regular satellites. When the spreading is fast, only one large satellite forms, as was the case for Pluto and Earth.

Parallelization in Scientific Workflow Management Systems,"Marc Bux, Ulf Leser","Over the last two decades, scientific workflow management systems (SWfMS) have emerged as a means to facilitate the design, execution, and monitoring of reusable scientific data processing pipelines. At the same time, the amounts of data generated in various areas of science outpaced enhancements in computational power and storage capabilities. This is especially true for the life sciences, where new technologies increased the sequencing throughput from kilobytes to terabytes per day. This trend requires current SWfMS to adapt: Native support for parallel workflow execution must be provided to increase performance; dynamically scalable ""pay-per-use"" compute infrastructures have to be integrated to diminish hardware costs; adaptive scheduling of workflows in distributed compute environments is required to optimize resource utilization. In this survey we give an overview of parallelization techniques for SWfMS, both in theory and in their realization in concrete systems.

Towards 3-Dimensional Rewriting Theory,Samuel Mimram,"String rewriting systems have proved very useful to study monoids. In good cases, they give finite presentations of monoids, allowing computations on those and their manipulation by a computer. Even better, when the presentation is confluent and terminating, they provide one with a notion of canonical representative of the elements of the presented monoid. Polygraphs are a higher-dimensional generalization of this notion of presentation, from the setting of monoids to the much more general setting of n-categories. One of the main purposes of this article is to give a progressive introduction to the notion of higher-dimensional rewriting system provided by polygraphs, and describe its links with classical rewriting theory, string and term rewriting systems in particular. After introducing the general setting, we will be interested in proving local confluence for polygraphs presenting 2-categories and introduce a framework in which a finite 3-dimensional rewriting system admits a finite number of critical pairs.",2014-03-17T13:50:03Z,2014-04-02T20:31:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4094v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4094v2,cs.LO

On Reachability for Unidirectional Channel Systems Extended with Regular   Tests,"Jancar Petr, Prateek Karandikar, Philippe Schnoebelen","""Unidirectional channel systems"" (Chambart & Schnoebelen, CONCUR 2008) are finite-state systems where one-way communication from a Sender to a Receiver goes via one reliable and one unreliable unbounded fifo channel. While reachability is decidable for these systems, equipping them with the possibility of testing regular properties on the contents of channels makes it undecidable.

Synthesis from Probabilistic Components,"Sumit Nain, Yoad Lustig, Moshe Y Vardi","Synthesis is the automatic construction of a system from its specification. In classical synthesis algorithms, it is always assumed that the system is ""constructed from scratch"" rather than composed from reusable components. This, of course, rarely happens in real life, where almost every non-trivial commercial software system relies heavily on using libraries of reusable components. Furthermore, other contexts, such as web-service orchestration, can be modeled as synthesis of a system from a library of components. Recently, Lustig and Vardi introduced dataflow and control-flow synthesis from libraries of reusable components. They proved that dataflow synthesis is undecidable, while control-flow synthesis is decidable. In this work, we consider the problem of control-flow synthesis from libraries of probabilistic components . We show that this more general problem is also decidable.",2014-07-07T11:10:16Z,2014-07-09T12:52:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1667v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1667v2,cs.LO
A type assignment for lambda-calculus complete both for FPTIME and   strong normalization,"Erika De Benedetti, Simona Ronchi Della Rocca","One of the aims of Implicit Computational Complexity is the design of programming languages with bounded computational complexity; indeed, guaranteeing and certifying a limited resources usage is of central importance for various aspects of computer science. One of the more promising approaches to this aim is based on the use of lambda-calculus as paradigmatic programming language and the design of type assignment systems for lambda-terms, where types guarantee both the functional correctness and the complexity bound. Here we propose a system of stratified types, inspired by intersection types, where intersection is a non-associative operator. The system, called STR, is correct and complete for polynomial time computations; moreover, all the strongly normalizing terms are typed in it, thus increasing the typing power with respect to the previous proposals. Moreover, STR enjoys a stronger expressivity with respect to the previous system STA, since it allows to type a restricted version of iteration.",2014-10-23T09:19:36Z,2014-10-23T09:19:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6298v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6298v1,"cs.LO, cs.CC, 03D15, F.4; F.4.1"

This is especially important given that the potential culinary space is practically infinite because of possible number of ingredient combinations as recipes. Such studies also provide a means to compare and contrast cuisines and to unearth their therapeutic value.

How to prove it in Natural Deduction: A Tactical Approach,"Favio E. Miranda-Perea, P.

We aim at capturing some of these tactics into a system of ND for minimal logic. Our goal is twofold: formal and didactic. The former delivers a formal system with its underlying heuristics to build proofs, which in turn serves our latter purpose, that of making an ideal system for the teaching of ND at an undergraduate level in a computer science program.",2015-07-14T00:51:53Z,2015-07-14T00:51:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03678v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03678v1,"cs.CY, cs.LO"

Constrained basin stability for studying transient phenomena in   dynamical systems,"Adrian van Kan, Jannes Jegminat, Jonathan Donges, Jürgen Kurths","Transient dynamics are of large interest in many areas of science. Here, a generalization of basin stability (BS) is presented: constrained basin stability (CBS) that is sensitive to various different types of transients arising from finite size perturbations. CBS is applied to the paradigmatic Lorenz system for uncovering nonlinear precursory phenomena of a boundary crisis bifurcation. Further, CBS is used in a model of the Earth's carbon cycle as a return time-dependent stability measure of the system's global attractor. Both case studies illustrate how CBS's sensitivity to transients complements BS in its function as an early warning signal and as a stability measure. CBS is broadly applicable in systems where transients matter, from physics and engineering to sustainability science. Thus, CBS complements stability analysis with BS as well as classical linear stability analysis and will be a useful tool for many applications.",2016-01-09T22:54:18Z,2016-03-19T14:41:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02162v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02162v2,nlin.CD
Question Answering via Integer Programming over Semi-Structured   Knowledge,"Daniel Khashabi, Tushar Khot, Ashish Sabharwal, Peter Clark, Oren Etzioni, Dan Roth","Answering science questions posed in natural language is an important AI challenge. Answering such questions often requires non-trivial inference and knowledge that goes beyond factoid retrieval. Yet, most systems for this task are based on relatively shallow Information Retrieval (IR) and statistical correlation techniques operating on large unstructured corpora. We propose a structured inference system for this task, formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), that answers natural language questions using a semi-structured knowledge base derived from text, including questions requiring multi-step inference and a combination of multiple facts. On a dataset of real, unseen science questions, our system significantly outperforms (+14%) the best previous attempt at structured reasoning for this task, which used Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). It also improves upon a previous ILP formulation by 17.7%. When combined with unstructured inference methods, the ILP system significantly boosts overall performance (+10%). Finally, we show our approach is substantially more robust to a simple answer perturbation compared to statistical correlation methods.",2016-04-20T19:48:07Z,2016-04-20T19:48:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06076v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06076v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"

On linear rewriting systems for Boolean logic and some applications to   proof theory,"Anupam Das, Lutz Straßburger","Linear rules have played an increasing role in structural proof theory in recent years. It has been observed that the set of all sound linear inference rules in Boolean logic is already coNP-complete, i.e. that every Boolean tautology can be written as a (left- and right-)linear rewrite rule. In this paper we study properties of systems consisting only of linear inferences. Our main result is that the length of any 'nontrivial' derivation in such a system is bound by a polynomial. As a consequence there is no polynomial-time decidable sound and complete system of linear inferences, unless coNP=NP. We draw tools and concepts from term rewriting, Boolean function theory and graph theory in order to access some required intermediate results. At the same time we make several connections between these areas that, to our knowledge, have not yet been presented and constitute a rich theoretical framework for reasoning about linear TRSs for Boolean logic.",2016-10-27T13:35:54Z,2016-12-27T20:55:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08772v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08772v4,"cs.LO, F.4.1; I.2.3"

In this paper we establish the feasible interpolation technique for all resolution-based QBF systems, whether modelling CDCL or expansion-based solving. This both provides the first general lower bound method for QBF proof systems as well as largely extends the scope of classical feasible interpolation. We apply our technique to obtain new exponential lower bounds to all resolution-based QBF systems for a new class of QBF formulas based on the clique problem.

Stochastic Climate Theory,"Georg A. Gottwald, Daan T. Crommelin, Christian L. E. Franzke","In this chapter we review stochastic modelling methods in climate science. First we provide a conceptual framework for stochastic modelling of deterministic dynamical systems based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. The Mori-Zwanzig equations contain a Markov term, a memory term and a term suggestive of stochastic noise. Within this framework we express standard model reduction methods such as averaging and homogenization which eliminate the memory term. We further discuss ways to deal with the memory term and how the type of noise depends on the underlying deterministic chaotic system. Secondly, we review current approaches in stochastic data-driven models. We discuss how the drift and diffusion coefficients of models in the form of stochastic differential equations can be estimated from observational data. We pay attention to situations where the data stems from multi scale systems, a relevant topic in the context of data from the climate system. Furthermore, we discuss the use of discrete stochastic processes (Markov chains) for e.g. stochastic subgrid-scale modeling and other topics in climate science.",2016-12-22T08:00:30Z,2016-12-22T08:00:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07474v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07474v1,"physics.ao-ph, nlin.CD"
A Compact and Lightweight Fibered Photometer for the PicSat Mission,"Mathias Nowak, Sylvestre Lacour, Vicent Lapeyrère, Lester David, Antoine Crouzier, Guillaume Schworer, Philippe Perrot, Sanaa Rayane","PicSat is a nanosatellite developed to observe the transit of the giant planet beta Pictoris b, expected in late 2017. Its science objectives are: the observation of the transit of the giant planet's Hill sphere, the detection of exocomets in the system, and the fine monitoring of the circumstellar disk inhomogeneities. To answer these objectives without exceeding the possibilities of a 3-unit Cubesat in terms of mass and power budget, a small but ambitious 2 kg opto-mechanical payload was designed. The instrument, specifically made for high precision photometry, uses a 3.5 cm effective aperture telescope which injects the light in a single-mode optical fiber linked to an avalanche photodiode. To ensure the stability of the light injection in the fiber, a fine pointing system based on a two-axis piezoelectric actuation system, is used.

A Collaborative Approach to Computational Reproducibility,"Fernando Chirigati, Rebecca Capone, Dennis Shasha, Remi Rampin, Juliana Freire","Although a standard in natural science, reproducibility has been only episodically applied in experimental computer science. Scientific papers often present a large number of tables, plots and pictures that summarize the obtained results, but then loosely describe the steps taken to derive them. Not only can the methods and the implementation be complex, but also their configuration may require setting many parameters and/or depend on particular system configurations. While many researchers recognize the importance of reproducibility, the challenge of making it happen often outweigh the benefits. Fortunately, a plethora of reproducibility solutions have been recently designed and implemented by the community. In particular, packaging tools (e.g., ReproZip) and virtualization tools (e.g., Docker) are promising solutions towards facilitating reproducibility for both authors and reviewers. To address the incentive problem, we have implemented a new publication model for the Reproducibility Section of Information Systems Journal. In this section, authors submit a reproducibility paper that explains in detail the computational assets from a previous published manuscript in Information Systems.",2017-08-09T20:33:45Z,2017-08-09T20:33:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01154v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01154v1,cs.DL
Decision Support System for Urbanization of the Northern Part of the   Volga-Akhtuba Floodplain (Russia) on the Basis of Interdisciplinary Computer   Modeling,"Alexander Voronin, Inessa Isaeva, Alexander Khoperskov, Sergey Grebenjuk","There is a computer decision support system (CDSS) for urbanization of the northern part of the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain. This system includes subsystems of cognitive and game-theoretic analysis, geoinformation and hydrodynamic simulations. The paper presents the cognitive graph, two-level and three-level models of hierarchical games for the cases of uncontrolled and controlled development of the problem situation. We described the quantitative analysis of the effects of different strategies for the spatial distribution of the urbanized territories. For this reason we conducted the territory zoning according to the level of negative consequences of urbanization for various agents. In addition, we found an analytical solution for games with the linear dependence of the average flooded area on the urbanized area. We numerically computed a game equilibrium for dependences derived from the imitational geoinformation and hydrodynamic modeling of flooding. As the result, we showed that the transition to the three-level management system and the implementation of an optimal urbanization strategy minimize its negative consequences.",2017-09-09T07:27:09Z,2017-09-09T07:27:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04120v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04120v1,cs.CY
A whirling plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A challenges   cold dark matter cosmology,"Oliver Müller, Marcel S.

Cosmological simulations predict that most satellite galaxy systems are close to isotropic with random motions, so those two well-studied systems are often interpreted as rare statistical outliers. We test this assumption using the kinematics of satellite galaxies around the Centaurus A galaxy. Our statistical analysis reveals evidence for corotation in a narrow plane: of the 16 Centaurus A's satellites with kinematic data, 14 follow a coherent velocity pattern aligned with the long axis of their spatial distribution. In standard cosmology simulations, < 0.5% of Centaurus A-like systems show such behavior.

In this study we will measure the dispersion of research performance within and between universities in the Italian university system, typically non-competitive. We will also investigate the level of correlation that occurs between performance in research and its dispersion in universities.

Reachability in Vector Addition Systems is Primitive-Recursive in Fixed   Dimension,"Jérôme Leroux, Sylvain Schmitz","The reachability problem in vector addition systems is a central question, not only for the static verification of these systems, but also for many inter-reducible decision problems occurring in various fields. The currently best known upper bound on this problem is not primitive-recursive, even when considering systems of fixed dimension. We provide significant refinements to the classical decomposition algorithm of Mayr, Kosaraju, and Lambert and to its termination proof, which yield an ACKERMANN upper bound in the general case, and primitive-recursive upper bounds in fixed dimension.

The proposed MPC approach can predict and optimize the future behaviors using multiorder derivatives of control input as decision variables.

A general framework for scientifically inspired explanations in AI,"David Tuckey, Alessandra Russo, Krysia Broda","Explainability in AI is gaining attention in the computer science community in response to the increasing success of deep learning and the important need of justifying how such systems make predictions in life-critical applications. The focus of explainability in AI has predominantly been on trying to gain insights into how machine learning systems function by exploring relationships between input data and predicted outcomes or by extracting simpler interpretable models. Through literature surveys of philosophy and social science, authors have highlighted the sharp difference between these generated explanations and human-made explanations and claimed that current explanations in AI do not take into account the complexity of human interaction to allow for effective information passing to not-expert users. In this paper we instantiate the concept of structure of scientific explanation as the theoretical underpinning for a general framework in which explanations for AI systems can be implemented. This framework aims to provide the tools to build a ""mental-model"" of any AI system so that the interaction with the user can provide information on demand and be closer to the nature of human-made explanations.

Mechanical properties of graphene oxide: the impact of functional groups,"Mahdi Tavakol, Abbas Montazeri, S. Hamed Aboutalebi, Reza Asgari","In the current study, mechanical characteristics of graphene oxide (GO) as a promising substitute of graphene are systematically studied through molecular dynamics simulation. For this purpose, several GO samples having different concentrations of epoxide and hydroxyl functional groups are considered. The results reveal that increasing the epoxide coverage causes a noticeable deterioration in the mechanical characteristics of GO systems. This change is correlated with the increase of the formation of ripples in the structure upon increasing the epoxide coverage. Moreover, investigating the bond lengths in the system, it is concluded that the higher epoxide percentage leads to an increase in the length of single and hybrid resonance bonds leading to an overall deterioration of the mechanical properties of GO samples. Additionally, our results demonstrate that high concentration of functional groups can lead to a negative Poisson ratio. Increasing the amount of hydroxyl groups shows the same declining effect on the Young modulus. In a graphene system containing both epoxide and hydroxyl groups, it is deduced that a higher percentage of the former can result in a higher residual strain because of the formation of more ripples within the system.",2020-05-02T05:42:39Z,2020-05-02T05:42:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00712v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00712v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall"

The reachability problem for vector addition systems is central since many other problems reduce to that question. The problem is decidable and it was recently proved that the dimension of the vector addition system is an important parameter of the complexity. In fixed dimensions larger than two, the complexity is not known (with huge complexity gaps). In dimension two, the reachability problem was shown to be PSPACE-complete by Blondin et al. in 2015. We consider an extension of this model, called 2-TVASS, where the first counter can be tested for zero. This model naturally extends the classical model of one counter automata (OCA). We show that reachability is still solvable in polynomial space for 2-TVASS.

INSPIRED: Toward Sociable Recommendation Dialog Systems,"Shirley Anugrah Hayati, Dongyeop Kang, Qingxiaoyang Zhu, Weiyan Shi, Zhou Yu","In recommendation dialogs, humans commonly disclose their preference and make recommendations in a friendly manner. However, this is a challenge when developing a sociable recommendation dialog system, due to the lack of dialog dataset annotated with such sociable strategies. Therefore, we present INSPIRED, a new dataset of 1,001 human-human dialogs for movie recommendation with measures for successful recommendations. To better understand how humans make recommendations in communication, we design an annotation scheme related to recommendation strategies based on social science theories and annotate these dialogs. Our analysis shows that sociable recommendation strategies, such as sharing personal opinions or communicating with encouragement, more frequently lead to successful recommendations. Based on our dataset, we train end-to-end recommendation dialog systems with and without our strategy labels. In both automatic and human evaluation, our model with strategy incorporation outperforms the baseline model.

We obtain two main characterizations of these sequences. The first one is concerned with $r$-block substitutions where $r$ morphisms are applied periodically. In particular, we provide examples of such sequences that are not morphic.

Efficient Local Computation of Differential Bisimulations via Coupling   and Up-to Methods,"Giorgio Bacci, Giovanni Bacci, Kim G. Larsen, Mirco Tribastone, Max Tschaikowski, Andrea Vandin","We introduce polynomial couplings, a generalization of probabilistic couplings, to develop an algorithm for the computation of equivalence relations which can be interpreted as a lifting of probabilistic bisimulation to polynomial differential equations, a ubiquitous model of dynamical systems across science and engineering. The algorithm enjoys polynomial time complexity and complements classical partition-refinement approaches because: (a) it implements a local exploration of the system, possibly yielding equivalences that do not necessarily involve the inspection of the whole system of differential equations; (b) it can be enhanced by up-to techniques; and (c) it allows the specification of pairs which ought not to be included in the output. Using a prototype, these advantages are demonstrated on case studies from systems biology for applications to model reduction and comparison. Notably, we report four orders of magnitude smaller runtimes than partition-refinement approaches when disproving equivalences between Markov chains.",2021-04-27T13:08:59Z,2021-04-27T13:08:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13160v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13160v1,cs.LO
Typability and Type Inference in Atomic Polymorphism,"M. Clarence Protin, Gilda Ferreira","It is well-known that typability, type inhabitation and type inference are undecidable in the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic system F. It has recently been proven that type inhabitation remains undecidable even in the predicative fragment of system F in which all universal instantiations have an atomic witness (system Fat). In this paper we analyze typability and type inference in Curry style variants of system Fat and show that typability is decidable and that there is an algorithm for type inference which is capable of dealing with non-redundancy constraints.",2021-04-28T09:54:38Z,2022-08-11T14:05:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13675v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13675v5,"cs.LO, math.LO, 03B15, 03B20, 03B40, 03B70, 03F03, F.4.1"
Double-bowl State in photonic Dirac nodal line semimetal,"Mengying Hu, Ye Zhang, Xi Jiang, Tong Qiao, Qiang Wang, Shining Zhu, Meng Xiao, Hui Liu","The past decade has seen a proliferation of topological materials for both insulators and semimetals in electronic systems and classical waves. Topological semimetals exhibit topologically protected band degeneracies, such as nodal points and nodal lines. Dirac nodal line semimetals (DNLS), which own four-fold line degeneracy, have drawn particular attention. DNLSs have been studied in electronic systems but there is no photonic DNLS. Here in this work, we provide a new mechanism which is unique for photonic systems to investigate a stringent photonic DNLS. When truncated, the photonic DNLS exhibits double-bowl states (DBS), which comprises two sets of perpendicularly polarized surface states. In sharp contrast to nondegenerate surface states in other photonic systems, here the two sets of surface states are almost degenerate over the whole spectrum range. The DBS and the bulk Dirac nodal ring (DNR) dispersion along the relevant directions, are experimentally resolved.",2021-08-10T08:42:59Z,2021-08-20T06:41:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04516v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04516v2,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
"A novel, Fourier series based method of control optimization and its   application to a discontinuous capsule drive model","Sandra Zarychta, Tomasz Sagan, Marek Balcerzak, Artur Dabrowski, Andrzej Stefanski, Tomasz Kapitaniak","This paper presents a novel, Fourier series based numerical method of open-loop control optimization. Due to its flexible assumptions, it can be applied in a large variety of systems, including discontinuous ones or even so-called black boxes, whose equations are not fully known. This aspect is particularly important in mechanical systems, where friction or impact induced discontinuities are common. The paper includes a mathematical background of the new method, a detailed discussion of the algorithm and a numerical example, in which control function of a discontinuous capsule drive is optimized. It is expected that the proposed method can facilitate research in all areas where control of non-smooth, discontinuous or black box systems is crucial.

A simulation framework for statistical inference on the alerting   capabilities of smartphone-based earthquake early warning systems. With a   case study on the Earthquake Network system in Haiti,"Francesco Finazzi, Frank Yannick Massoda Tchoussi","Smartphone-based earthquake early warning systems implemented by citizen science initiatives are characterized by a significant variability in their smartphone network geometry. This has an direct impact on the earthquake detection capability and performance of the system. Here, a simulation framework based on the Monte Carlo method is implemented for making inference on relevant quantities of the earthquake detection such as the detection distance from the epicentre, the detection delay and the warning time for people exposed to high ground shaking levels. The framework is applied to Haiti, which has experienced deadly earthquakes in the past decades, and to the network of the Earthquake Network citizen science initiative, which is popular in the country. It is discovered that relatively low penetrations of the initiative among the population allow to offer a robust early warning service, with warning times up to 12 second for people exposed to intensities between 7.5 and 8.5 of the modified Mercalli scale.",2022-11-02T14:35:52Z,2022-11-02T14:35:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01158v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01158v1,"stat.AP, physics.geo-ph"

Priority Based Pre-emptive Task Scheduling for Android Operating System,"Deepali Kayande, Urmila Shrawankar","Android mobile operating system which is based on Linux Kernel 2.6, has open source license and adaptability to user driven applications. As all other operating systems it has all the basic features like process scheduling, memory management, process management etc associated with it. Any mobile platform works smoothly when the process scheduling is performed in a proper way. Ideal platform is that in which no resource conflict occurs. Thus scheduling in every manner is essential for the operating system to adapt itself with the requirement of a particular application. In this paper, priority based pre-emptive task scheduling is proposed for the SMS application. The idea is to define High priority to required contacts, for ex. Contact numbers of parents or teachers will be given High priority. If in case, any SMS from these High priority contacts is received, the application would flash the SMS on the active screen and redirect this High priority SMS to the Priority Inbox.",2013-04-30T06:00:42Z,2013-04-30T06:00:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7889v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7889v1,cs.OH
A Formal Methods Approach to Pattern Synthesis in Reaction Diffusion   Systems,"Ebru Aydin Gol, Ezio Bartocci, Calin Belta","We propose a technique to detect and generate patterns in a network of locally interacting dynamical systems. Central to our approach is a novel spatial superposition logic, whose semantics is defined over the quad-tree of a partitioned image. We show that formulas in this logic can be efficiently learned from positive and negative examples of several types of patterns. We also demonstrate that pattern detection, which is implemented as a model checking algorithm, performs very well for test data sets different from the learning sets. We define a quantitative semantics for the logic and integrate the model checking algorithm with particle swarm optimization in a computational framework for synthesis of parameters leading to desired patterns in reaction-diffusion systems.",2014-09-12T05:21:06Z,2014-09-12T05:21:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5671v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5671v1,"cs.AI, cs.CE, cs.LG, cs.LO, cs.SY"
Toward a Distributed Knowledge Discovery system for Grid systems,"Nhien-An Le-Khac, Lamine Aouad, M-Tahar Kechadi","During the last decade or so, we have had a deluge of data from not only science fields but also industry and commerce fields. Although the amount of data available to us is constantly increasing, our ability to process it becomes more and more difficult. Efficient discovery of useful knowledge from these datasets is therefore becoming a challenge and a massive economic need. This led to the need of developing large-scale data mining (DM) techniques to deal with these huge datasets either from science or economic applications. In this chapter, we present a new DDM system combining dataset-driven and architecture-driven strategies. Data-driven strategies will consider the size and heterogeneity of the data, while architecture driven will focus on the distribution of the datasets. This system is based on a Grid middleware tools that integrate appropriate large data manipulation operations.

Physics-Informed Echo State Networks for Chaotic Systems Forecasting,"Nguyen Anh Khoa Doan, Wolfgang Polifke, Luca Magri","We propose a physics-informed Echo State Network (ESN) to predict the evolution of chaotic systems. Compared to conventional ESNs, the physics-informed ESNs are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while ensuring that their predictions do not violate physical laws. This is achieved by introducing an additional loss function during the training of the ESNs, which penalizes non-physical predictions without the need of any additional training data. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system, where the physics-informed ESNs improve the predictability horizon by about two Lyapunov times as compared to conventional ESNs. The proposed framework shows the potential of using machine learning combined with prior physical knowledge to improve the time-accurate prediction of chaotic dynamical systems.",2019-04-09T10:01:56Z,2019-04-09T10:01:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11122v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11122v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.ET, cs.LG, cs.NE, stat.ML"

Progress and Challenges in Ab Initio Simulations of Quantum Nuclei in   Weakly Bonded Systems,Mariana Rossi,"Atomistic simulations based on the first-principles of quantum mechanics are reaching unprecedented length scales. This progress is due to the growth in computational power allied with the development of new methodologies that allow the treatment of electrons and nuclei as quantum particles. In the realm of materials science, where the quest for desirable emergent properties relies increasingly on soft weakly-bonded materials, such methods have become indispensable. In this perspective, an overview of simulation methods that are applicable for large system sizes and that can capture the quantum nature of electrons and nuclei in the adiabatic approximation is given. In addition, the remaining challenges are discussed, especially regarding the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQE) beyond a harmonic or perturbative treatment, the impact of NQE on electronic properties of weakly-bonded systems, and how different first-principles potential energy surfaces can change the impact of NQE on the atomic structure and dynamics of weakly bonded systems.",2021-03-06T22:59:20Z,2021-03-06T22:59:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04206v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04206v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.chem-ph"
Synthesis from Weighted Specifications with Partial Domains over Finite   Words,"Emmanuel Filiot, Christof Löding, Sarah Winter","In this paper, we investigate the synthesis problem of terminating reactive systems from quantitative specifications. Such systems are modeled as finite transducers whose executions are represented as finite words in $(I\times O)^*$, where $I,O$ are finite sets of input and output symbols, respectively. A weighted specification $S$ assigns a rational value (or $-\infty$) to words in $(I\times O)^*$, and we consider three kinds of objectives for synthesis, namely threshold objectives where the system's executions are required to be above some given threshold, best-value and approximate objectives where the system is required to perform as best as it can by providing output symbols that yield the best value and $\varepsilon$-best value respectively w.r.t. $S$. We establish a landscape of decidability results for these three objectives and weighted specifications with partial domain over finite words given by deterministic weighted automata equipped with sum, discounted-sum and average measures. The resulting objectives are not regular in general and we develop an infinite game framework to solve the corresponding synthesis problems, namely the class of (weighted) critical prefix games.",2021-03-09T16:57:12Z,2021-03-09T16:57:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05550v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05550v1,"cs.FL, cs.GT, cs.LO"

Transforming Outermost into Context-Sensitive Rewriting,"Joerg Endrullis, Dimitri Hendriks","We define two transformations from term rewriting systems (TRSs) to context-sensitive TRSs in such a way that termination of the target system implies outermost termination of the original system.

This transformation turns out to be complete for the class of left-linear TRSs. The second transformation is called `dynamic labeling' and results in smaller sized context-sensitive TRSs. Here each modeled step is adjoined with a small number of auxiliary steps. As a result state-of-the-art termination methods for context-sensitive rewriting become available for proving termination of outermost rewriting. Both transformations have been implemented in Jambox, making it the most successful tool in the category of outermost rewriting of the last edition of the annual termination competition.",2010-05-31T09:57:45Z,2010-06-29T12:54:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5648v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.5648v2,"cs.LO, D.1.1, D.3.1, F.4.1, F.4.2, I.1.1, I.1.3"

Such analogies give promise of a unified and universal theory for describing the complex responses of those systems. There are, however, very few attempts to simultaneously characterize the most fundamental seismic laws in such systems. Here we present a complete description of the Gutenberg-Richter law, the recurrence times, Omori's law, the productivity law, and Bath's law for the acoustic emissions that happen in the relaxation process of uncrumpling thin plastic sheets. Our results show that these laws also appear in this phenomenon, but (for most cases) with different parameters from those reported for earthquakes and fracture experiments. This study thus contributes to elucidate the parallel between seismic laws and cracking noises in uncrumpling processes, revealing striking qualitative similarities but also showing that these processes display unique features.",2016-06-06T10:09:51Z,2016-06-06T10:09:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01678v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01678v1,"physics.geo-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.data-an"

We show coverability decidable for monotone transition systems that only require the absence of infinite antichains and call well behaved transitions systems (WBTS) the new strict superclass of the class of WSTS that arises. By contrast, we confirm that boundedness and termination are undecidable for WBTS under the usual hypotheses, and show that stronger monotonicity conditions can enforce decidability. Proofs are similar or even identical to existing proofs but the surprising message is that a hypothesis implicitely assumed minimal for twenty years in the theory of WSTS can meaningfully be relaxed, allowing more orderings to be handled in an abstract way.",2016-08-08T22:02:29Z,2017-09-12T15:14:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02636v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02636v3,"cs.LO, F.1.1; F.3.1"

Dynamical observations following driving suffice to infer physical connectivity even if they are temporally disordered, are acquired at large sampling intervals, and stem from different experiments.

Science with a ngVLA: Imaging planetary systems in the act of forming   with the ngVLA,"Luca Ricci, Andrea Isella, Shang-Fei Liu, Hui Li","The discovery of thousands of exoplanets has shown that the birth of planets is a very efficient process in nature. Several physical mechanisms have been proposed to describe the assembly of planets in disks surrounding young stars. However, observational constraints have been sparse on account of insufficient sensitivity and resolution, especially for imaging the inner $10 - 20$ au from the star, where most of planets are observed. Thanks to its unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity at wavelengths where the emission from the circumstellar material is optically thin, the ngVLA has the potential to transform our understanding of planet formation. In this chapter, we present state-of-the-art theoretical models of planetary systems in the act of forming that demonstrate ngVLA capabilities of imaging and follow the temporal evolution of young solar system analogues up to the distance of the Orion Nebula.

For both methods we discuss the importance of using multiple hypothesis test correction. Specific applications of statistically validated networks are discussed.

This approach allowed us to explore the dynamic evolution of electron beam-induced processes in a silicon-doped graphene system, but it can be also applied for a much broader range of atomic-scale and mesoscopic phenomena to introduce the bottom-up order parameters and explore their dynamics with time and in response to external stimuli.",2020-06-18T04:17:46Z,2021-04-13T06:09:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10267v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10267v2,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
High-dimensional inference: a statistical mechanics perspective,Jean Barbier,"Statistical inference is the science of drawing conclusions about some system from data. In modern signal processing and machine learning, inference is done in very high dimension: very many unknown characteristics about the system have to be deduced from a lot of high-dimensional noisy data. This ""high-dimensional regime"" is reminiscent of statistical mechanics, which aims at describing the macroscopic behavior of a complex system based on the knowledge of its microscopic interactions. It is by now clear that there are many connections between inference and statistical physics. This article aims at emphasizing some of the deep links connecting these apparently separated disciplines through the description of paradigmatic models of high-dimensional inference in the language of statistical mechanics.

An Analytic Propositional Proof System on Graphs,"Matteo Acclavio, Ross Horne, Lutz Straßburger","In this paper we present a proof system that operates on graphs instead of formulas. Starting from the well-known relationship between formulas and cographs, we drop the cograph-conditions and look at arbitrary undirected) graphs. This means that we lose the tree structure of the formulas corresponding to the cographs, and we can no longer use standard proof theoretical methods that depend on that tree structure. In order to overcome this difficulty, we use a modular decomposition of graphs and some techniques from deep inference where inference rules do not rely on the main connective of a formula. For our proof system we show the admissibility of cut and a generalisation of the splitting property. Finally, we show that our system is a conservative extension of multiplicative linear logic with mix, and we argue that our graphs form a notion of generalised connective.",2020-12-02T11:39:57Z,2022-10-20T09:37:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01102v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01102v6,cs.LO
Effects of Magnetic And Aharanov-Bohm (AB) Fields on the Energy Spectra   of the Yukawa Potential,Collins Edet,"In this article, the Yukawa potential is scrutinized taking into consideration the effects of magnetic and AB flux fields within the non-relativistic regime using the factorization method. The energy equation and wave function of the system are obtained in close form. We find that the all-encompassing effects result in a strongly attractive system and consequently there is a significant upward shift in the bound state energy of the system. We also find that to achieve a low-energy medium for the Yukawa potential, weak magnetic field is required, however the AB flux field can be used as a controller. The magnetic and AB fields eliminates the degeneracy from the spectra. From our findings, it could be concluded that to manipulate the energy spectra of this system, the AB-flux and magnetic field will do so greatly. The results from this study can be applied in condensed matter physics, atomic and molecular physics.",2020-12-15T22:02:29Z,2020-12-15T22:02:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08644v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08644v1,quant-ph

Wang, Alexios A. Michailidis, Nishad Maskara, Wen Wei Ho, Soonwon Choi, Maksym Serbyn, Markus Greiner, Vladan Vuletic, Mikhail D. Lukin","Controlling non-equilibrium quantum dynamics in many-body systems is an outstanding challenge as interactions typically lead to thermalization and a chaotic spreading throughout Hilbert space. We experimentally investigate non-equilibrium dynamics following rapid quenches in a many-body system composed of 3 to 200 strongly interacting qubits in one and two spatial dimensions. Using a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays, we probe coherent revivals corresponding to quantum many-body scars. Remarkably, we discover that scar revivals can be stabilized by periodic driving, which generates a robust subharmonic response akin to discrete time-crystalline order. We map Hilbert space dynamics, geometry dependence, phase diagrams, and system-size dependence of this emergent phenomenon, demonstrating novel ways to steer entanglement dynamics in many-body systems and enabling potential applications in quantum information science.",2020-12-22T19:00:02Z,2020-12-22T19:00:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12276v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12276v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, physics.atom-ph"
Confluence up to Garbage in Graph Transformation,"Graham Campbell, Detlef Plump","The transformation of graphs and graph-like structures is ubiquitous in computer science. When a system is described by graph-transformation rules, it is often desirable that the rules are both terminating and confluent so that rule applications in an arbitrary order produce unique resulting graphs. However, there are application scenarios where the rules are not globally confluent but confluent on a subclass of graphs that are of interest. In other words, non-resolvable conflicts can only occur on graphs that are considered as ""garbage"". In this paper, we introduce the notion of confluence up to garbage and generalise Plump's critical pair lemma for double-pushout graph transformation, providing a sufficient condition for confluence up to garbage by non-garbage critical pair analysis. We apply our results in two case studies about efficient language recognition: we present backtracking-free graph reduction systems which recognise a class of flow diagrams and a class of labelled series-parallel graphs, respectively. Both systems are non-confluent but confluent up to garbage. We also give a critical pair condition for subcommutativity up to garbage which, together with closedness, implies confluence up to garbage even in non-terminating systems.",2021-01-06T01:26:49Z,2021-01-06T01:26:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01842v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01842v1,cs.LO
Flow stability for dynamic community detection,"Alexandre Bovet, Jean-Charles Delvenne, Renaud Lambiotte","Many systems exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the presence of different processes taking place simultaneously. An important task in such systems is to extract a simplified view of their time-dependent network of interactions. Community detection in temporal networks usually relies on aggregation over time windows or consider sequences of different stationary epochs. For dynamics-based methods, attempts to generalize static-network methodologies also face the fundamental difficulty that a stationary state of the dynamics does not always exist. Here, we derive a method based on a dynamical process evolving on the temporal network. Our method allows dynamics that do not reach a steady state and uncovers two sets of communities for a given time interval that accounts for the ordering of edges in forward and backward time. We show that our method provides a natural way to disentangle the different dynamical scales present in a system with synthetic and real-world examples.",2021-01-15T14:23:58Z,2022-05-20T13:27:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06131v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06131v3,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI, math.DS, physics.data-an"
Analog Raychaudhuri equation in mechanics,"Rajendra Prasad Bhatt, Anushree Roy, Sayan Kar","Usually, in mechanics, we obtain the trajectory of a particle in a given force field by solving Newton's second law with chosen initial conditions. In contrast, through our work here, we first demonstrate how one may analyse the behaviour of a suitably defined family of trajectories of a given mechanical system. Such an approach leads us to develop a mechanics analog following the well-known Raychaudhuri equation largely studied in Riemannian geometry and general relativity. The idea of geodesic focusing, which is more familiar to a relativist, appears to be analogous to the meeting of trajectories of a mechanical system within a finite time. Applying our general results to the case of simple pendula, we obtain relevant quantitative consequences. Thereafter, we set up and perform a straightforward experiment based on a system with two pendula. The experimental results on this system are found to tally well with our proposed theoretical model. In summary, the simple theory, as well as the related experiment, provides us with a way to understand the essence of a fairly involved concept in advanced physics from an elementary standpoint.",2021-05-11T09:18:58Z,2022-05-19T05:16:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04887v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04887v2,gr-qc
Towards Physical Hybrid Systems,"Katherine Cordwell, André Platzer","Some hybrid systems models are unsafe for mathematically correct but physically unrealistic reasons. For example, mathematical models can classify a system as being unsafe on a set that is too small to have physical importance. In particular, differences in measure zero sets in models of cyber-physical systems (CPS) have significant mathematical impact on the mathematical safety of these models even though differences on measure zero sets have no tangible physical effect in a real system. We develop the concept of ""physical hybrid systems"" (PHS) to help reunite mathematical models with physical reality. We modify a hybrid systems logic (differential temporal dynamic logic) by adding a first-class operator to elide distinctions on measure zero sets of time within CPS models. This approach facilitates modeling since it admits the verification of a wider class of models, including some physically realistic models that would otherwise be classified as mathematically unsafe. We also develop a proof calculus to help with the verification of PHS.",2019-05-23T08:00:17Z,2019-09-14T14:35:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09520v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09520v2,"cs.LO, cs.SY, 03B70, 34A38, F.4.1; F.3.1"
(Co)inductive Proof Systems for Compositional Proofs in Reachability   Logic,"Vlad Rusu, David Nowak","Reachability Logic is a formalism that can be used, among others, for expressing partial-correctness properties of transition systems. In this paper we present three proof systems for this formalism, all of which are sound and complete and inherit the coinductive nature of the logic. The proof systems differ, however, in several aspects. First, they use induction and coinduction in different proportions. The second aspect regards compositionality, broadly meaning their ability to prove simpler formulas on smaller systems, and to reuse those formulas as lemmas for more complex formulas on larger systems. The third aspect is the difficulty of their soundness proofs. We show that the more induction a proof system uses, and the more specialised is its use of coinduction (with respect to our problem domain), the more compositional the proof system is, but the more difficult its soundness proof becomes. We also briefly present mechanisations of these results in the Isabelle/HOL and Coq proof assistants.",2019-09-04T12:48:35Z,2019-09-04T12:48:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01744v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01744v1,cs.LO
Foundations of Explainable Knowledge-Enabled Systems,"Shruthi Chari, Daniel M. Gruen, Oshani Seneviratne, Deborah L.

However, many of these approaches were tightly coupled with the capabilities of the artificial intelligence systems at the time. With the proliferation of AI-enabled systems in sometimes critical settings, there is a need for them to be explainable to end-users and decision-makers. We present a historical overview of explainable artificial intelligence systems, with a focus on knowledge-enabled systems, spanning the expert systems, cognitive assistants, semantic applications, and machine learning domains. Additionally, borrowing from the strengths of past approaches and identifying gaps needed to make explanations user- and context-focused, we propose new definitions for explanations and explainable knowledge-enabled systems.",2020-03-17T04:18:48Z,2020-03-17T04:18:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07520v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07520v1,"cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.LO"

In this paper we develop a theory of approximation for systems of fixpoint equations in the style of abstract interpretation: a system over some concrete domain is abstracted to a system in a suitable abstract domain, with conditions ensuring that the abstract solution represents a sound/complete overapproximation of the concrete solution.   Interestingly, up-to techniques, a classical approach used in coinductive settings to obtain easier or feasible proofs, can be interpreted as abstractions in a way that they naturally fit in our framework and extend to systems of equations.   Additionally, relying on the approximation theory, we can provide a characterisation of the solution of systems of fixpoint equations over complete lattices in terms of a suitable parity game, generalising some recent work that was restricted to continuous lattices.   The game view opens the way to the development of on-the-fly algorithms for characterising the solution of such equation systems.",2020-03-19T15:56:03Z,2021-06-18T09:20:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08877v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08877v2,cs.LO

To find this possible solution is used a novel numerical method valid for one and several variables, which using the fractional derivative, allows us to find solutions for some nonlinear systems in the complex space using real initial conditions, this method is also valid for linear systems.

Moment-Based Ensemble Control,"Vignesh Narayanan, Wei Zhang, Jr-Shin Li","Controlling a large population, in the limit, a continuum, of structurally identical dynamical systems with parametric variations is a pervasive task in diverse applications in science and engineering. However, the severely underactuated nature and the inability to avail comprehensive state feedback information of such ensemble systems raise significant challenges in analysis and design of ensemble systems. In this paper, we propose a moment-based ensemble control framework, which incorporates and expands the method of moments in probability theory to control theory. In particular, we establish an equivalence between ensemble systems and their moment systems in terms of control and their controllability properties by extending the Hausdorff moment problem from the perspectives of differential geometry and dynamical systems. The developments enable the design of moment-feedback control laws for closing the loop in ensemble systems using the aggregated type of measurements.

Combinatorics-Based Approaches to Controllability Characterization for   Bilinear Systems,"Gong Cheng, Wei Zhang, Jr-Shin Li","The control of bilinear systems has attracted considerable attention in the field of systems and control for decades, owing to their prevalence in diverse applications across science and engineering disciplines. Although much work has been conducted on analyzing controllability properties, the mostly used tool remains the Lie algebra rank condition. In this paper, we develop alternative approaches based on theory and techniques in combinatorics to study controllability of bilinear systems. The core idea of our methodology is to represent vector fields of a bilinear system by permutations or graphs, so that Lie brackets are represented by permutation multiplications or graph operations, respectively. Following these representations, we derive combinatorial characterization of controllability for bilinear systems, which consequently provides novel applications of symmetric group and graph theory to control theory. Moreover, the developed combinatorial approaches are compatible with Lie algebra decompositions, including the Cartan and non-intertwining decomposition. This compatibility enables the exploitation of representation theory for analyzing controllability, which allows us to characterize controllability properties of bilinear systems governed by semisimple and reductive Lie algebras.",2020-09-07T21:18:22Z,2020-09-07T21:18:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03430v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03430v1,"math.OC, 93B05, 93A15, 93C10, 34K35"
Hybrid coupling optomechanically assisted nonreciprocal photon blockade,"Yong-Pan Gao, Chuan Wang","The properties of open quantum system in quantum information science is now extensively investigated more generally by the research community as a fundamental issue for a variety of applications. Usually, the states of the open quantum system might be disturbed by the decoherence which will reduce the fidelity in the quantum information processing. So it is better to eliminate the influence of the environment. However, as part of the composite system, rational use of the environment system could be beneficial to quantum information processing. Here we theoretically studied the environment induced quantum nonlinearity and energy spectrum tuning method in the optomechanical system. And we found that the dissipation coupling of the hybrid dissipation and dispersion optomechanical system can induce the coupling between the environment and system in the cross- Kerr interaction form. When the symmetry is broken with a directional pumping environment, the system exhibits the non-reciprocal behavior during the photon excitation and photon blockade for the clockwise and counterclockwise modes of the whispering-gallery mode microcavity. Furthermore, we believe that the cross-Kerr coupling can also be used in a more widely region in quantum information processing and quantum simulation.",2020-11-30T00:40:28Z,2020-11-30T00:40:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14480v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14480v1,"quant-ph, physics.optics"

Industry, research and individuals face the challenging task of collaborating and networking over long distances. While video and teleconferencing are already widespread, collaboration systems in augmented, virtual, and mixed reality are still a niche technology. We provide an overview of recent developments of synchronous remote collaboration systems and create a taxonomy by dividing them into three main components that form such systems: Environment, Avatars, and Interaction. A thorough overview of existing systems is given, categorising their main contributions in order to help researchers working in different fields by providing concise information about specific topics such as avatars, virtual environment, visualisation styles and interaction.

System identification using Bayesian neural networks with nonparametric   noise models,"Christos Merkatas, Simo Särkkä","System identification is of special interest in science and engineering. This article is concerned with a system identification problem arising in stochastic dynamic systems, where the aim is to estimate the parameters of a system along with its unknown noise processes. In particular, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach for system identification in discrete time nonlinear random dynamical systems assuming only the order of the Markov process is known. The proposed method replaces the assumption of Gaussian distributed error components with a highly flexible family of probability density functions based on Bayesian nonparametric priors. Additionally, the functional form of the system is estimated by leveraging Bayesian neural networks which also leads to flexible uncertainty quantification. Asymptotically on the number of hidden neurons, the proposed model converges to full nonparametric Bayesian regression model.

Conformal Prediction for STL Runtime Verification,"Lars Lindemann, Xin Qin, Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh, George J.

Particularly, we consider stochastic systems and signal temporal logic specifications, and we want to calculate the probability that the current system trajectory violates the specification. The paper presents two predictive runtime verification algorithms that predict future system states from the current observed system trajectory. As these predictions may not be accurate, we construct prediction regions that quantify prediction uncertainty by using conformal prediction, a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. Our first algorithm directly constructs a prediction region for the satisfaction measure of the specification so that we can predict specification violations with a desired confidence. The second algorithm constructs prediction regions for future system states first, and uses these to obtain a prediction region for the satisfaction measure. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first formal guarantees for a predictive runtime verification algorithm that applies to widely used trajectory predictors such as RNNs and LSTMs, while being computationally simple and making no assumptions on the underlying distribution.

Learning and Designing Stochastic Processes from Logical Constraints,"Luca Bortolussi, Guido Sanguinetti","Stochastic processes offer a flexible mathematical formalism to model and reason about systems. Most analysis tools, however, start from the premises that models are fully specified, so that any parameters controlling the system's dynamics must be known exactly. As this is seldom the case, many methods have been devised over the last decade to infer (learn) such parameters from observations of the state of the system. In this paper, we depart from this approach by assuming that our observations are {\it qualitative} properties encoded as satisfaction of linear temporal logic formulae, as opposed to quantitative observations of the state of the system. An important feature of this approach is that it unifies naturally the system identification and the system design problems, where the properties, instead of observations, represent requirements to be satisfied. We develop a principled statistical estimation procedure based on maximising the likelihood of the system's parameters, using recent ideas from statistical machine learning.

Incentive Mechanisms to Prevent Efficiency Loss of Non-Profit Utilities,"Carlos Barreto, Eduardo Mojica-Nava, Nicanor Quijano","The modernization of the power system introduces technologies that may improve the system's efficiency by enhancing the capabilities of users. Despite their potential benefits, such technologies can have a negative impact. This subject has widely analyzed, mostly considering for-profit electric utilities. However, the literature has a gap regarding the impact of new technologies on non-profit utilities.   In this work, we quantify the price of anarchy of non-profit utilities, that is, the cost caused by lack of coordination of users. We find that users, in the worst case, can consume up to twice the optimal demand, obtaining a small fraction of the optimal surplus. For this reason, we leverage the theory of mechanism design to design an incentive scheme that reduces the inefficiencies of the system, which preserves the privacy of users.

From Observability to Significance in Distributed Information Systems,Mark Burgess,"To understand and explain process behaviour we need to be able to see it, and decide its significance, i.e. be able to tell a story about its behaviours. This paper describes a few of the modelling challenges that underlie monitoring and observation of processes in IT, by human or by software. The topic of the observability of systems has been elevated recently in connection with computer monitoring and tracing of processes for debugging and forensics. It raises the issue of well-known principles of measurement, in bounded contexts, but these issues have been left implicit in the Computer Science literature. This paper aims to remedy this omission, by laying out a simple promise theoretic model, summarizing a long standing trail of work on the observation of distributed systems, based on elementary distinguishability of observations, and classical causality, with history. Three distinct views of a system are sought, across a number of scales, that described how information is transmitted (and lost) as it moves around the system, aggregated into journals and logs.",2019-07-12T09:11:59Z,2019-07-25T12:46:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05636v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05636v2,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.DC, cs.SY, eess.SY, I.2.8; I.2.11; C.2.3; C.2.4; H.1.1"
Multi-Agent Safety Verification using Symmetry Transformations,"Hussein Sibai, Navid Mokhlesi, Chuchu Fan, Sayan Mitra","We show that symmetry transformations and caching can enable scalable, and possibly unbounded, verification of multi-agent systems. Symmetry transformations map solutions and to other solutions. We show that this property can be used to transform cached reachsets to compute new reachsets, for hybrid and multi-agent models. We develop a notion of virtual system which define symmetry transformations for a broad class of agent models that visit waypoint sequences. Using this notion of virtual system, we present a prototype tool CacheReach that builds a cache of reachtubes for this system, in a way that is agnostic of the representation of the reachsets and the reachability analysis subroutine used. Our experimental evaluation of CacheReach shows up to 66% savings in safety verification computation time on multi-agent systems with 3-dimensional linear and 4-dimensional nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft models following sequences of waypoints.

Priority Quality Attributes for Engineering AI-enabled Systems,"Lena Pons, Ipek Ozkaya","Deploying successful software-reliant systems that address their mission goals and user needs within cost, resource, and expected quality constraints require design trade-offs. These trade-offs dictate how systems are structured and how they behave and consequently can effectively be evolved and sustained. Software engineering practices address this challenge by centering system design and evolution around delivering key quality attributes, such as security, privacy, data centricity, sustainability, and explainability. These concerns are more urgent requirements for software-reliant systems that also include AI components due to the uncertainty introduced by data elements. Moreover, systems employed by the public sector exhibit unique design time and runtime challenges due to the regulatory nature of the domains. We assert that the quality attributes of security, privacy, data centricity, sustainability, and explainability pose new challenges to AI engineering and will drive the success of AI-enabled systems in the public sector.

Diagrammatic Formalism for Complex Systems: More than One Way to   Eventize a Railcar System,Sabah Al-Fedaghi,"This paper is in the intersection of software engineering and system engineering, two intimately intertwined disciplines. A dominating theme in this paper is the integral conceptualization of systems at large, as well as an underlying concern with software systems. In the software development life cycle, challenges still exist in translating requirements into a design artifact and then into an implementation (e.g., coding), then validating the results. From our perspective, software engineering requires an integrating paradigm toward a unified modeling orientation. Many methodologies, languages, and tools exist for facilitating system development processes. This paper is a venture into project development. To focus the materials, we concentrate on Harel s novel (and classic) development environment, which integrates a scenario-based engineering object orientation and statecharts through developing a railcar system.

Exploring Blockchain for The Coordination of Distributed Energy   Resources,"Qing Yang, Hao Wang","The fast growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed renewables (e.g., rooftop PV panels), energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and controllable appliances, drives the power system toward a decentralized system with bidirectional power flow. The coordination of DERs through an aggregator, such as a utility, system operator, or a third-party coordinator, emerges as a promising paradigm. However, it is not well understood how to enable trust between the aggregator and DERs to integrate DERs efficiently. In this paper, we develop a trustable and distributed coordination system for DERs using blockchain technology. We model various DERs and formulate a cost minimization problem for DERs to optimize their energy trading, scheduling, and demand response. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. To implement the distributed algorithm in a trustable way, we design a smart contract to update multipliers and communicate with DERs in a blockchain network. We validate our design by experiments using real-world data, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",2021-03-10T13:32:33Z,2021-03-10T13:32:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06046v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06046v1,"cs.DC, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Methods for constructing parameter-dependent flat band lattices,"Toshitaka Ogata, Mitsuaki Kawamura, Taisuke Ozaki","We present two methods for constructing a flat band (FB) system having a flat energy dispersion over the entire Brillouin zone within tight-binding model, where the resulting Hamiltonian may not be easily obtained by existing methods based on a bipartite graph and line graph techniques. In the first method, we derive a set of conditions equivalent to the appearance of FBs for a given graph structure. This method allows parameter to be tuned so that systems with a small number of sites per unit cell has a FB. In the second method, we show that FB systems can be obtained by removing or adding sites to an existing FB system under specific rules. In particular, the site addition method enables us to construct multiple FB systems stemming from a single FB system. The FB system obtained by the second method has the characteristics that the component ratios in the FB eigenstate are partially common to the original system. We illustrate how lattices having a FB can be constructed by applying the latter method starting from an existing lattice such as a kagome lattice, demonstrating that a wide variety of lattices can possess a FB in the band structure.",2021-03-18T04:50:17Z,2021-03-18T04:50:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10019v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10019v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Wigner-Smith Time Delay Matrix for Electromagnetics: Guiding and   Periodic Systems with Evanescent Modes,"Yiqian Mao, Utkarsh R. Patel, Eric Michielssen","The Wigner-Smith (WS) time delay matrix relates an electromagnetic system's scattering matrix and its frequency derivative. Previous work showed that the entries of WS time delay matrices of systems excited by propagating waves consist of volume integrals of energy-like field quantities. This paper introduces a generalized WS relationship that applies to systems excited by mixtures of propagating and evanescent fields. Just like its predecessor, the generalized WS relationship allows for the identification of so-called WS modes that interact with the system with well-defined time delays. Furthermore, a technique is developed to compute the WS time delay matrix of a composite system from the WS time delay matrices of its subsystems. Numerical examples demonstrate the usefulness of the generalized WS method when characterizing time delays experienced by fields interacting with guiding and periodic structures that have ports supporting evanescent modes.",2022-06-03T06:23:03Z,2022-06-03T06:23:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02571v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02571v1,"eess.SY, cs.CE, cs.SY, physics.comp-ph"
"About Digital Twins, agents, and multiagent systems: a   cross-fertilisation journey","Stefano Mariani, Marco Picone, Alessandro Ricci","Digital Twins (DTs) are rapidly emerging as a fundamental brick of engineering cyber-physical systems, but their notion is still mostly bound to specific business domains (e.g. manufacturing), goals (e.g. product design), or application domains (e.g. the Internet of Things). As such, their value as general purpose engineering abstractions is yet to be fully revealed. In this paper, we relate DTs with agents and multiagent systems, as the latter are arguably the most rich abstractions available for the engineering of complex socio-technical and cyber-physical systems, and the former could both fill in some gaps in agent-oriented engineering and benefit from an agent-oriented interpretation -- in a cross-fertilisation journey.",2022-06-07T13:08:46Z,2022-06-07T13:08:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03253v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03253v1,"cs.MA, I.2.11; D.2.10; D.2.11"

Self-Similarity Breeds Resilience,"Sanjiva Prasad, Lenore D. Zuck","Self-similarity is the property of a system being similar to a part of itself. We posit that a special class of behaviourally self-similar systems exhibits a degree of resilience to adversarial behaviour. We formalise the notions of system, adversary and resilience in operational terms, based on transition systems and observations. While the general problem of proving systems to be behaviourally self-similar is undecidable, we show, by casting them in the framework of well-structured transition systems, that there is an interesting class of systems for which the problem is decidable. We illustrate our prescriptive framework for resilience with some small examples, e.g., systems robust to failures in a fail-stop model, and those avoiding side-channel attacks.",2016-08-10T11:10:49Z,2016-08-10T11:10:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03127v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03127v1,"cs.PL, cs.LO, cs.SE"
DG-Embedded Radial Distribution System Planning Using Binary-Selective   PSO,"Ahvand Jalali, S K. Mohammadi, H. Sangrody, A.

On the other hand, the increasing penetration of renewable distributed generation (DG) resources into the distribution systems and the necessity of optimally place them in the network can dramatically change the problem of distribution system planning and design. In this paper, the problem of optimal distribution system planning including conductor sizing, DG placement, alongside with placement and sizing of shunt capacitors is studied. A new Binary-Selective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach which is capable of handling all types of continuous, binary and selective variables, simultaneously, is proposed to solve the optimization problem of distribution system planning.

Solving Constrained Horn Clauses Using Dependence-Disjoint Expansions,"Qi Zhou, David Heath, William Harris","Recursion-free Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are logic-programming problems that can model safety properties of programs with bounded iteration and recursion. In addition, many CHC solvers reduce recursive systems to a series of recursion-free CHC systems that can each be solved efficiently.   In this paper, we define a novel class of recursion-free systems, named Clause-Dependence Disjoint (CDD), that generalizes classes defined in previous work. The advantage of this class is that many CDD systems are smaller than systems which express the same constraints but are part of a different class. This advantage in size allows CDD systems to be solved more efficiently than their counterparts in other classes. We implemented a CHC solver named Shara. Shara solves arbitrary CHC systems by reducing the input to a series of CDD systems. Our evaluation indicates that Shara outperforms state-of-the-art implementations in many practical cases.",2017-05-09T03:42:57Z,2018-09-14T21:29:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03167v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03167v2,cs.LO

In this paper we study the expressiveness (w.r.t. bisimulations) of models for quantitative computations such as weighted labelled transition systems (WLTSs), uniform labelled transition systems (ULTraSs), and state-to-function transition systems (FuTSs). We prove that there is a trade-off between labels and weights: at one extreme lays the class of (unlabelled) weighted transition systems where information is presented using weights only; at the other lays the class of labelled transition systems (LTSs) where information is shifted on labels. These categories of systems cannot be further reduced in any significant way and subsume all the aforementioned models.",2017-05-18T07:01:42Z,2017-05-18T07:01:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06439v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06439v1,"cs.LO, F.1.2; F.3.2"

We parametrically extend, with the notion of interface role and interface connection, the syntax of global-type formalisms. Semantically, global types with interface roles denote open systems of communicating finite state machines connected by means of gateways obtained from compatible interfaces.

Formal structure of periodic system of elements,"Wilmer Leal, Guillermo Restrepo","For more than 150 years the structure of the periodic system of the chemical elements has intensively motivated research in different areas of chemistry and physics.

Herein, based on the relations of order and similarity, we report a formal mathematical structure for the periodic system, which corresponds to an ordered hypergraph. It is shown that the current periodic system of chemical elements is an instance of the general structure. The definition is used to devise a tailored periodic system of polarizability of single covalent bonds, where order relationships are quantified within subsets of similar bonds and among these classes.

Their computation is not at all evident, especially in multi-parameter families. In this paper, we consider a four-parameter family of semitoric systems with two focus-focus singularities.

Traction chain networks: Insights beyond force chain networks for   non-spherical particle systems,Daniel N. Wilke,"Force chain networks are generally applied in granular materials to gain insight into inter-particle granular contact. For conservative spherical particle systems, i.e. frictionless and undamped, force chains are information complete due to symmetries resulting from isotropy and constant curvature of a sphere. In fact, for conservative spherical particle systems, given the geometry and material, the force chain network uniquely defines the contact state that includes elastic forces, penetration distance, overlap volume, contact areas and contact pressures in a particle system. This is, however, not the case for conservative non-spherical particle systems. The reason is that a force chain network is not sufficient to uniquely define the contact state in a conservative non-spherical particle system. Additional information is required to define the contact state of non-spherical granular systems. Traction chain networks are proposed to complement force chain networks for the improved quantification of the state of contact of a granular system.",2021-06-07T16:33:39Z,2021-06-07T16:33:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03771v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03771v1,"cond-mat.soft, cs.CE, physics.comp-ph, 70-10, 37M05, J.2; I.6.6; I.6.4"
Lagrangian Neural Network with Differentiable Symmetries and Relational   Inductive Bias,"Ravinder Bhattoo, Sayan Ranu, N. M. Anoop Krishnan","Realistic models of physical world rely on differentiable symmetries that, in turn, correspond to conservation laws. Recent works on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian neural networks show that the underlying symmetries of a system can be easily learned by a neural network when provided with an appropriate inductive bias. However, these models still suffer from issues such as inability to generalize to arbitrary system sizes, poor interpretability, and most importantly, inability to learn translational and rotational symmetries, which lead to the conservation laws of linear and angular momentum, respectively. Here, we present a momentum conserving Lagrangian neural network (MCLNN) that learns the Lagrangian of a system, while also preserving the translational and rotational symmetries. We test our approach on linear and non-linear spring systems, and a gravitational system, demonstrating the energy and momentum conservation. We also show that the model developed can generalize to systems of any arbitrary size.

An Energy Management System Approach for Power System Cyber-Physical   Resilience,Katherine Davis,"Power systems are large scale cyber-physical critical infrastructure that form the basis of modern society.

Mapping these threats to their grid resilience impacts to stop them early requires a timely and detailed view of the entire cyber-physical system.

Although the test generation problem is critical in the development of safe systems, it often fails because of the spatial and temporal complexity of the system descriptions. This paper presents a compositional test generation method to address the complexity issue. We regard a test case as a counterexample in safety verification, and represent a test generation process as a deductive proof tree built with dedicated inference rules; we conduct both spatial- and temporal-compositional reasoning along with a modular system structure. A proof tree is generated using our semi-automated scheme involving manual effort on contract generation and automatic processes for counterexample search with SMT solvers.

Here, we develop a theory of topological metals based on the system's spectral localizer and associated Clifford pseudospectrum, which can both determine whether a system exhibits boundary-localized states despite the presence of degenerate bulk bands and provide a measure of these states' topological protection even in the absence of a bulk band gap. We demonstrate the generality of this method across symmetry classes in two lattice systems, a Chern metal and a higher-order topological metal, and prove the topology of these systems is robust to relatively strong perturbations. The ability to define invariants for metallic and gapless systems allows for the possibility of finding topological phenomena in a broad range of natural, photonic, and other artificial materials that could not be previously explored.",2021-12-16T04:55:27Z,2022-05-26T16:30:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08623v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08623v2,"cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, math-ph, math.MP, physics.optics"
Self-Modifying Code in Open-Ended Evolutionary Systems,Patrik Christen,"Having a model and being able to implement open-ended evolutionary systems is important for advancing our understanding of open-endedness. Complex systems science and newest generation high-level programming languages provide intriguing possibilities to do so.

Then, the so-called allagmatic method is introduced that describes, models, implements, and allows interpretation of complex systems. After highlighting some current modelling and implementation challenges, model building blocks of open-ended evolutionary systems are identified, a system metamodel of open-ended evolution is formalised in the allagmatic method, an implementation self-modifying code prototype with a high-level programming language is provided, and guidance from the allagmatic method to create code blocks is described. The proposed prototype allows modifying code at runtime in a controlled way within a system metamodel. Since the allagmatic method has been built based on metaphysical concepts borrowed from Gilbert Simondon and Alfred N.

An automaton model is also presented for encoding arbitrary computational processes, and an algorithm is presented to generate an automaton representation of a closed-loop system. Using the automaton model, the problem of timing-agnostic verification of closed-loop systems against a desired behavioural specification, encoded as the similarity of closed-loop systems in terms of the set of computations performed, is shown to be decidable.

Learning Linear Representations of Nonlinear Dynamics Using Deep   Learning,"Akhil Ahmed, Ehecatl Antonio del Rio-Chanona, Mehmet Mercangoz","The vast majority of systems of practical interest are characterised by nonlinear dynamics. This renders the control and optimization of such systems a complex task due to their nonlinear behaviour. Additionally, standard methods such as linearizing around a fixed point may not be an effective strategy for many systems, thus requiring an alternative approach. For this reason, we propose a new deep learning framework to discover a transformation of a nonlinear dynamical system to an equivalent higher dimensional linear representation. We demonstrate that the resulting learned linear representation accurately captures the dynamics of the original system for a wider range of conditions than standard linearization. As a result of this, we show that the learned linear model can subsequently be used for the successful control of the original system. We demonstrate this by applying the proposed framework to two examples; one from the literature and a more complex example in the form of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR).",2022-04-03T12:49:11Z,2022-04-03T12:49:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01064v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01064v1,"eess.SY, cs.CE, cs.SY"
Quantum Computing and Preconditioners for Hydrological Linear Systems,"John Golden, Daniel O'Malley, Hari Viswanathan","Modeling hydrological fracture networks is a hallmark challenge in computational earth sciences. Accurately predicting critical features of fracture systems, e.g. percolation, can require solving large linear systems far beyond current or future high performance capabilities. Quantum computers can theoretically bypass the memory and speed constraints faced by classical approaches, however several technical issues must first be addressed. Chief amongst these difficulties is that such systems are often ill-conditioned, i.e. small changes in the system can produce large changes in the solution, which can slow down the performance of linear solving algorithms. We test several existing quantum techniques to improve the condition number, but find they are insufficient.

Structural Inference of Networked Dynamical Systems with Universal   Differential Equations,"James Koch, Zhao Chen, Aaron Tuor, Jan Drgona, Draguna Vrabie","Networked dynamical systems are common throughout science in engineering; e.g., biological networks, reaction networks, power systems, and the like. For many such systems, nonlinearity drives populations of identical (or near-identical) units to exhibit a wide range of nontrivial behaviors, such as the emergence of coherent structures (e.g., waves and patterns) or otherwise notable dynamics (e.g., synchrony and chaos). In this work, we seek to infer (i) the intrinsic physics of a base unit of a population, (ii) the underlying graphical structure shared between units, and (iii) the coupling physics of a given networked dynamical system given observations of nodal states. These tasks are formulated around the notion of the Universal Differential Equation, whereby unknown dynamical systems can be approximated with neural networks, mathematical terms known a priori (albeit with unknown parameterizations), or combinations of the two. We demonstrate the value of these inference tasks by investigating not only future state predictions but also the inference of system behavior on varied network topologies. The effectiveness and utility of these methods is shown with their application to canonical networked nonlinear coupled oscillators.",2022-07-11T15:40:53Z,2022-07-11T15:40:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04962v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04962v1,"math.DS, cs.LG"
P versus B: P Systems as a Formal Framework for Controllability of   Boolean Networks,"Artiom Alhazov, Rudolf Freund, Sergiu Ivanov","Membrane computing and P systems are a paradigm of massively parallel natural computing introduced by Gheorghe P\u{a}un in 1999, inspired by the structure of the living cell and by its biochemical reactions. In spite of this explicit biological motivation, P systems have not been extensively used in modelling real-world systems. To confirm this intuition, we establish a state of the art investigation comparing the use of P systems to that of Boolean networks in this line of research. We then propose to use P systems as a tool for setting up formal frameworks to reason about other formalisms, and we introduce Boolean P systems, specifically tailored for capturing sequential controllability of Boolean networks. We show how to tackle some technical challenges and prove that sequential controllability properly embeds in the framework of Boolean P systems.",2022-08-31T09:29:03Z,2022-08-31T09:29:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14723v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14723v1,cs.FL
A Generic Type System for Higher-Order $Ψ$-calculi,"Alex Rønning Bendixen, Bjarke Bredow Bojesen, Hans Hüttel, Stian Lybech","The Higher-Order $\Psi$-calculus framework (HO$\Psi$) is a generalisation of many first- and higher-order extensions of the $\pi$-calculus. It was proposed by Parrow et al. who showed that higher-order calculi such as HO$\pi$ and CHOCS can be expressed as HO$\Psi$-calculi. In this paper we present a generic type system for HO$\Psi$-calculi which extends previous work by H\""uttel on a generic type system for first-order $\Psi$-calculi. Our generic type system satisfies the usual property of subject reduction and can be instantiated to yield type systems for variants of HO{\pi}, including the type system for termination due to Demangeon et al. Moreover, we derive a type system for the $\rho$-calculus, a reflective higher-order calculus proposed by Meredith and Radestock. This establishes that our generic type system is richer than its predecessor, as the $\rho$-calculus cannot be encoded in the $\pi$-calculus in a way that satisfies standard criteria of encodability.",2022-09-06T10:38:39Z,2022-09-06T10:38:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02354v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02354v1,"cs.LO, cs.PL"
Physics-Guided Adversarial Machine Learning for Aircraft Systems   Simulation,"Houssem Ben Braiek, Thomas Reid, Foutse Khomh","In the context of aircraft system performance assessment, deep learning technologies allow to quickly infer models from experimental measurements, with less detailed system knowledge than usually required by physics-based modeling. However, this inexpensive model development also comes with new challenges regarding model trustworthiness. This work presents a novel approach, physics-guided adversarial machine learning (ML), that improves the confidence over the physics consistency of the model. The approach performs, first, a physics-guided adversarial testing phase to search for test inputs revealing behavioral system inconsistencies, while still falling within the range of foreseeable operational conditions. Then, it proceeds with physics-informed adversarial training to teach the model the system-related physics domain foreknowledge through iteratively reducing the unwanted output deviations on the previously-uncovered counterexamples. Empirical evaluation on two aircraft system performance models shows the effectiveness of our adversarial ML approach in exposing physical inconsistencies of both models and in improving their propensity to be consistent with physics domain knowledge.",2022-09-07T19:23:45Z,2022-09-07T19:23:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03431v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03431v1,"cs.LG, cs.CE, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Bayesian Identification of Nonseparable Hamiltonian Systems Using   Stochastic Dynamic Models,"Harsh Sharma, Nicholas Galioto, Alex A.

Nonseparable Hamiltonian systems arise in models from diverse science and engineering applications such as astrophysics, robotics, vortex dynamics, charged particle dynamics, and quantum mechanics. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method recovers dynamical systems with higher accuracy and reduced predictive uncertainty compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The results further show that accurate predictions far outside the training time interval in the presence of sparse and noisy measurements are possible, which lends robustness and generalizability to the proposed approach. A quantitative benefit is prediction accuracy with less than 10% relative error for more than 12 times longer than a comparable least-squares-based method on a benchmark problem.",2022-09-15T23:11:11Z,2022-09-15T23:11:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07646v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07646v1,"math.DS, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an"
Squeezing stationary distributions of stochastic chemical reaction   systems,"Yuji Hirono, Ryo Hanai","Stochastic modeling of chemical reaction systems based on master equations has been an indispensable tool in physical sciences. In the long-time limit, the properties of these systems are characterized by stationary distributions of chemical master equations. In this paper, we describe a novel method for computing stationary distributions analytically, based on a parallel formalism between stochastic chemical reaction systems and second quantization. Anderson, Craciun, and Kurtz showed that, when the rate equation for a reaction network admits a complex-balanced steady-state solution, the corresponding stochastic reaction system has a stationary distribution of a product form of Poisson distributions. In a formulation of stochastic reaction systems using the language of second quantization initiated by Doi, product-form Poisson distributions correspond to coherent states. Pursuing this analogy further, we study the counterpart of squeezed states in stochastic reaction systems. Under the action of a squeeze operator, the time-evolution operator of the chemical master equation is transformed, and the resulting system describes a different reaction network, which does not admit a complex-balanced steady state. A squeezed coherent state gives the stationary distribution of the transformed network, for which analytic expression is obtained.",2022-09-19T06:34:21Z,2022-09-19T06:34:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08787v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08787v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.MN, quant-ph"
Solving Quantified Modal Logic Problems by Translation to Classical   Logics,"Alexander Steen, Geoff Sutcliffe, Christoph Benzmüller","This article describes an evaluation of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) systems on problems taken from the QMLTP library of first-order modal logic problems.

Additionally, the results from native modal logic ATP systems are considered, and compared with the results from the embedding approach. The findings are that the embedding process is reliable and successful when state-of-the-art ATP systems are used as backend reasoners, The first-order and higher-order embeddings perform similarly, native modal logic ATP systems have comparable performance to classical systems using the embedding for proving theorems, native modal logic ATP systems are outperformed by the embedding approach for disproving conjectures, and the embedding approach can cope with a wider range of modal logics than the native modal systems considered.",2022-12-19T16:02:14Z,2024-04-29T13:40:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09570v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09570v3,"cs.LO, cs.AI, F.4.1; I.2.3"

Exploring Optimization Techniques for Parameter Estimation in Nonlinear   System Modeling,Kaushal Kumar,"Optimization techniques play a crucial role in estimating parameters and state information for nonlinear systems. However, some critical aspects of these problems have received little attention in previous research. In this paper, we address this gap by exploring optimization techniques for parameter estimation in nonlinear system modeling, with a focus on chaotic dynamical systems. We introduce three optimization methods - a gradient-based iterative algorithm, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and the Nelder-Mead simplex method - that transfer the complex nonlinear optimization problem into a simpler linear or nonlinear one. We apply these methods to determine the parameters of nonlinear systems, presenting a numerical example to demonstrate their effectiveness. Our results show that the Nelder-Mead simplex method is particularly effective in estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems and has the potential to be a valuable tool in various fields that require nonlinear system modeling. Overall, our study contributes to the understanding and improvement of optimization techniques for parameter estimation in nonlinear system modeling, which has implications for a wide range of applications in science and engineering.",2023-04-29T22:20:03Z,2023-04-29T22:20:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00351v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00351v1,"math.OC, nlin.CD"
Polynomial Identity Testing and the Ideal Proof System: PIT is in NP if   and only if IPS can be p-simulated by a Cook-Reckhow proof system,Joshua A. Grochow,"The Ideal Proof System (IPS) of Grochow & Pitassi (FOCS 2014, J. ACM, 2018) is an algebraic proof system that uses algebraic circuits to refute the solvability of unsatisfiable systems of polynomial equations. One potential drawback of IPS is that verifying an IPS proof is only known to be doable using Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT), which is solvable by a randomized algorithm, but whose derandomization, even into NSUBEXP, is equivalent to strong lower bounds. However, the circuits that are used in IPS proofs are not arbitrary, and it is conceivable that one could get around general PIT by leveraging some structure in these circuits. This proposal may be even more tempting when IPS is used as a proof system for Boolean Unsatisfiability, where the equations themselves have additional structure.   Our main result is that, on the contrary, one cannot get around PIT as above: we show that IPS, even as a proof system for Boolean Unsatisfiability, can be p-simulated by a deterministically verifiable (Cook-Reckhow) proof system if and only if PIT is in NP.

This research aims to address this limitation by developing a mapping scheme between the two systems and using it to understand whether there are differences in the assignment of contribution by authors under the two systems. We use all research articles published in PLoS ONE between 2012 to 2020, divided into two five-year publication windows centered by the shift of the classification systems in 2016. Our results show that most tasks (except for writing- and resource-related tasks) are used similarly under the two systems. Moreover, notable differences between how researchers used the two systems are also examined and discussed.

"Observability for Nonlinear Systems: Connecting Variational Dynamics,   Lyapunov Exponents, and Empirical Gramians","Mohamad H. Kazma, Ahmad F. Taha","Observability quantification is a key problem in dynamic network sciences. While it has been thoroughly studied for linear systems, observability quantification for nonlinear networks is less intuitive and more cumbersome. One common approach to quantify observability for nonlinear systems is via the Empirical Gramian (Empr-Gram) -- a generalized form of the Gramian of linear systems. In this paper, we produce three new results. First, we establish that a variational form of discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems (computed via perturbing initial conditions) yields a so-called Variational Gramian (Var-Gram) that is equivalent to the classic Empr-Gram; the former being easier to compute than the latter. Via Lyapunov exponents derived from Lyapunov's direct method, the paper's second result derives connections between existing observability measures and Var-Gram. The third result demonstrates the applicability of these new notions for sensor selection/placement in nonlinear systems. Numerical case studies demonstrate these three developments and their merits.",2024-02-22T17:11:41Z,2025-01-16T14:35:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14711v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14711v4,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback   Control,"Kim Hammar, Rolf Stadler","We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.",2024-04-02T09:00:45Z,2024-06-05T06:50:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01741v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01741v5,"cs.DC, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.GT, cs.SY, eess.SY"

While efforts to ensure fairness during development are crucial, they leave deployed ML systems vulnerable to potentially exhibiting discrimination during their operations. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for on-the-fly tracking and correction of discrimination in deployed ML systems. Leveraging counterfactual explanations, the framework continuously monitors the predictions made by an ML system and flags discriminatory outcomes. When flagged, post-hoc explanations related to the original prediction and the counterfactual alternatives are presented to a human reviewer for real-time intervention. This human-in-the-loop approach empowers reviewers to accept or override the ML system decision, enabling fair and responsible ML operation under dynamic settings.

User-Creator Feature Polarization in Recommender Systems with Dual   Influence,"Tao Lin, Kun Jin, Andrew Estornell, Xiaoying Zhang, Yiling Chen, Yang Liu","Recommender systems serve the dual purpose of presenting relevant content to users and helping content creators reach their target audience. The dual nature of these systems naturally influences both users and creators: users' preferences are affected by the items they are recommended, while creators may be incentivized to alter their content to attract more users. We define a model, called user-creator feature dynamics, to capture the dual influence of recommender systems. We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to polarize, causing diversity loss in the system. We then investigate, both theoretically and empirically, approaches for mitigating polarization and promoting diversity in recommender systems. Unexpectedly, we find that common diversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence, while relevancy-optimizing methods like top-$k$ truncation can prevent polarization and improve diversity of the system.",2024-07-19T07:58:26Z,2024-10-31T21:26:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14094v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14094v2,"cs.IR, cs.CY, cs.GT, cs.LG"
Observability of complex systems via conserved quantities,"Bhargav Karamched, Jack Schmidt, David Murrugarra","Many systems in biology, physics, and engineering are modeled by nonlinear dynamical systems where the states are usually unknown and only a subset of the state variables can be physically measured. Can we understand the full system from what we measure? In the mathematics literature, this question is framed as the observability problem. It has to do with recovering information about the state variables from the observed states (the measurements). In this paper, we relate the observability problem to another structural feature of many models relevant in the physical and biological sciences: the conserved quantity. For models based on systems of differential equations, conserved quantities offer desirable properties such as dimension reduction which simplifies model analysis. Here, we use differential embeddings to show that conserved quantities involving a set of special variables provide more flexibility in what can be measured to address the observability problem for systems of interest in biology. Specifically, we provide conditions under which a collection of conserved quantities make the system observable. We apply our methods to provide alternate measurable variables in models where conserved quantities have been used for model analysis historically in biological contexts.",2024-07-31T20:02:57Z,2024-07-31T20:02:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00143v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00143v1,"math.DS, math.OC"

We provide such a treatment in the framework of universal coalgebra, in which the type of a system (nondeterministic, probabilistic, weighted, game-based etc.) is abstracted as a set functor: We introduce relational connectors among set functors, which induce notions of heterogeneous (bi)simulation among coalgebras of the respective types. We give a number of constructions on relational connectors. In particular, we identify composition and converse operations on relational connectors; we construct corresponding identity relational connectors, showing that the latter generalize the standard Barr extension of weak-pullback-preserving functors; and we introduce a Kantorovich construction in which relational connectors are induced from relations between modalities. For Kantorovich relational connectors, one has a notion of dual-purpose modal logic interpreted over both system types, and we prove a corresponding Hennessy-Milner-type theorem stating that generalized (bi)similarity coincides with theory inclusion on finitely-branching systems.

Adaptive Network Intervention for Complex Systems: A Hierarchical Graph   Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Qiliang Chen, Babak Heydari","Effective governance and steering of behavior in complex multi-agent systems (MAS) are essential for managing system-wide outcomes, particularly in environments where interactions are structured by dynamic networks. In many applications, the goal is to promote pro-social behavior among agents, where network structure plays a pivotal role in shaping these interactions.

Operating within the constraints of limited managerial authority, the HGRL framework demonstrates superior performance across a range of environmental conditions, outperforming established baseline methods. Our findings highlight the critical influence of agent-to-agent learning (social learning) on system behavior: under low social learning, the HGRL manager preserves cooperation, forming robust core-periphery networks dominated by cooperators. In contrast, high social learning accelerates defection, leading to sparser, chain-like networks. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of the system manager's authority level in preventing system-wide failures, such as agent rebellion or collapse, positioning HGRL as a powerful tool for dynamic network-based governance.",2024-10-30T18:59:02Z,2024-10-30T18:59:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23396v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23396v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.MA"

Many scientists' research increasingly depends on the quality and availability of software upon which their works are built. To highlight some of these issues and share experiences, the First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE1) was held in November 2013 in conjunction with the SC13 Conference. The workshop featured keynote presentations and a large number (54) of solicited extended abstracts that were grouped into three themes and presented via panels. A set of collaborative notes of the presentations and discussion was taken during the workshop.   Unique perspectives were captured about issues such as comprehensive documentation, development and deployment practices, software licenses and career paths for developers. Attribution systems that account for evidence of software contribution and impact were also discussed. These include mechanisms such as Digital Object Identifiers, publication of ""software papers"", and the use of online systems, for example source code repositories like GitHub.   This paper summarizes the issues and shared experiences that were discussed, including cross-cutting issues and use cases. It joins a nascent literature seeking to understand what drives software work in science, and how it is impacted by the reward systems of science. These incentives can determine the extent to which developers are motivated to build software for the long-term, for the use of others, and whether to work collaboratively or separately. It also explores community building, leadership, and dynamics in relation to successful scientific software.",2014-04-29T16:04:40Z,2014-06-12T13:31:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7414v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.7414v2,cs.SE

One of the main objectives of the Science Working Group (SWG) inside iALMA, the Work Package 1, is to develop the Italian contribution to the Science Case for the ALMA Band 2 or Band 2+3 receiver. ALMA Band 2 receiver spans from ~67 GHz (bounded by an opaque line complex of ozone lines) up to 90 GHz which overlaps with the lower frequency end of ALMA Band 3. Receiver technology has advanced since the original definition of the ALMA frequency bands. It is now feasible to produce a single receiver which could cover the whole frequency range from 67 GHz to 116 GHz, encompassing Band 2 and Band 3 in a single receiver cartridge, a so called Band 2+3 system. In addition, upgrades of the ALMA system are now foreseen that should double the bandwidth to 16 GHz. The science drivers discussed below therefore also discuss the advantages of these two enhancements over the originally foreseen Band 2 system.",2015-09-09T10:01:40Z,2015-09-11T07:50:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02702v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02702v2,astro-ph.IM

This can only be achieved with coordinated multi-point observations with high temporal resolution as they have the scientific potential to track the whole dynamics of the system (from small to large scales), and they constitute the next generation of Mars' exploration as it happened at Earth few decades ago. This White Paper discusses the key science questions that are still open at Mars and how they could be addressed with coordinated multipoint missions. The main science questions are: (i) How does solar wind driving impact on magnetospheric and ionospheric dynamics? (ii) What is the structure and nature of the tail of Mars' magnetosphere at all scales? (iii) How does the lower atmosphere couple to the upper atmosphere? (iv) Why should we have a permanent in-situ Space Weather monitor at Mars?

This will cause that the far-field image can not correctly reflect the phase information, resulting in the performance degradation of image-based intelligent algorithms. In this paper, we make a theoretical analysis on phase ambiguity. To the best of our knowledge, we give the number and descriptions of all solutions of the phase ambiguity problem in above system for the first time. A method to solve phase ambiguity is proposed, which requires no additional optical devices. We designed simulations to verify our conclusions and methods. We believe that our work solves the phase ambiguity problem in theory and is conducive to improving the performance of image-based algorithms.

Enhanced Frequency noise suppression for LISA by combining cavity and   arm locking control systems,"Jobin Thomas Valliyakalayil, Andrew J. H. Sutton, Robert E. Spero, Daniel A. Shaddock, Kirk McKenzie","This paper presents a novel method for laser frequency stabilisation in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by locking a laser to two stable length references - the arms of the interferometer and an on-board optical cavity. The two references are digitally fused using carefully designed control systems, attempting minimal or no changes to the baseline LISA mission hardware. The interferometer arm(s) provides the most stable reference available in the LISA science band (0.1 mHz - 1 Hz), while the cavity sensor's wide-band and linear readout enables additional control system gain below and above the LISA band. The main technical issue with this dual sensor approach is the undesirable slow laser frequency pulling which couples into the control system with the imperfect knowledge of the Doppler shift of the light due to relative spacecraft motion along the LISA arm. This paper outlines requirements on the Doppler shift knowledge to maintain the cavity well within the resonance when activating the fused control system. Two Doppler shift estimation methods are presented that use the already on-board measurements, the inter-spacecraft interferometer link (the main science measurement), and the absolute inter-spacecraft laser ranging system. Both methods reach the required precision after a few thousand seconds of measurement integration. The paper demonstrates an approach to initialise and engage the proposed laser stabilization system, starting from free-running laser and ending with the dual sensor frequency control system. The results show that the technique lowers the residual laser frequency noise in the LISA science band by over 3 orders of magnitude, potentially allowing the requirements on Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI) to be relaxed - possibly to the point where first-generation TDI may be sufficient.",2021-10-21T03:16:56Z,2022-03-01T23:12:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10870v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10870v2,gr-qc
Measuring entanglement entropy and its topological signature for   phononic systems,"Zhi-Kang Lin, Yao Zhou, Bin Jiang, Bing-Quan Wu, Li-Mei Chen, Xiao-Yu Liu, Li-Wei Wang, Peng Ye, Jian-Hua Jiang","Entanglement entropy is a fundamental concept with rising importance in different fields ranging from quantum information science, black holes to materials science. In complex materials and systems, entanglement entropy provides insight into the collective degrees of freedom that underlie the systems' complex behaviours. As well-known predictions, the entanglement entropy exhibits area laws for systems with gapped excitations, whereas it follows the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law in gapless fermion systems. Furthermore, the entanglement spectrum provides salient characterizations of topological phases and phase transitions beyond the conventional paradigms. However, many of these fundamental predictions have not yet been confirmed in experiments due to the difficulties in measuring entanglement entropy in physical systems. Here, we report the experimental verification of the above predictions by probing the nonlocal correlations in phononic systems. From the pump-probe responses in phononic crystals, we obtain the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum for phononic systems with the fermion filling analog. With these measurements, we verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law of entanglement entropy for various quasiparticle dispersions in one- and two-dimensions. Moreover, we observe the salient signatures of topological phases in the entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy which unveil an unprecedented probe of topological phases without relying on the bulk-boundary correspondence. The progress here opens a frontier where entanglement entropy serves as an important experimental tool in the study of emergent phases and phase transitions which can be generalized to non-Hermitian and other unconventional regimes.",2023-12-14T03:30:58Z,2023-12-14T03:30:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08632v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08632v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.optics"

Furthermore, a computational model that enables an artificial system to achieve cognitive development will be an excellent reference for brain and cognitive science. This paper describes an approach to develop a cognitive architecture by integrating elemental cognitive modules to enable the training of the modules as a whole. This approach is based on two ideas: (1) brain-inspired AI, learning human brain architecture to build human-level intelligence, and (2) a probabilistic generative model(PGM)-based cognitive system to develop a cognitive system for developmental robots by integrating PGMs. The development framework is called a whole brain PGM (WB-PGM), which differs fundamentally from existing cognitive architectures in that it can learn continuously through a system based on sensory-motor information. In this study, we describe the rationale of WB-PGM, the current status of PGM-based elemental cognitive modules, their relationship with the human brain, the approach to the integration of the cognitive modules, and future challenges. Our findings can serve as a reference for brain studies. As PGMs describe explicit informational relationships between variables, this description provides interpretable guidance from computational sciences to brain science. By providing such information, researchers in neuroscience can provide feedback to researchers in AI and robotics on what the current models lack with reference to the brain.

Using the C4ISR Architecture Framework as a Tool to Facilitate VV&A for   Simulation Systems within the Military Application Domain,Andreas Tolk,"To harmonize the individual architectures of the different commands, services, and agencies dealing with the development and procurement of Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Intelligence (C4ISR) systems, the C4ISR Architecture Framework was developed based on existing and matured modeling techniques and methods. Within a short period, NATO adapted this method family as the NATO Consultation, Command, and Control (C3) System Architecture Framework to harmonize the efforts of the different nations. Based on these products, for every system to be fielded to be used in the US Armed Forces, a C4I Support Plan (C4ISP) has to be developed enabling the integration of the special system into the integrated C4I Architecture. The tool set proposed by these architecture frameworks connects operational views of the military user, system views of the developers, and the technical views for standards and integration methods needed to make the network centric system of systems work. The tools are therefore logically a valuable backbone for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A). Their application is not limited to C4ISR systems; they can be used to define requirements and connected solutions and algorithms of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) systems as well. Especially for M&S systems to be used in connection with C4ISR system, the use of the C4ISR Architecture Framework would not only be a help, but can nearly be seen to be necessary to avoid double work and foster reuse and interoperability from the first stages of a project on. To enable the reader to build his own picture, the respective tools used and their application in the context of VV&A will be explained in form of an overview.",2010-11-25T17:31:47Z,2010-11-25T17:31:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5656v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.5656v1,cs.OH
Verification of Agent-Based Artifact Systems,"Francesco Belardinelli, Alessio Lomuscio, Fabio Patrizi","Artifact systems are a novel paradigm for specifying and implementing business processes described in terms of interacting modules called artifacts. Artifacts consist of data and lifecycles, accounting respectively for the relational structure of the artifacts' states and their possible evolutions over time. In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems operating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services, the semantics we give explicitly accounts for the data structures on which artifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for artifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications written in a quantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the agents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in general. We then identify two noteworthy restrictions, one syntactical and one semantical, that enable us to find bisimilar finite abstractions and therefore reduce the model checking problem to the instance on finite models. Under these assumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is EXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and declarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system and the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state systems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on finite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. Finally we exemplify the theoretical results of the paper through a mainstream procurement scenario from the artifact systems literature.",2013-01-12T11:45:54Z,2013-01-22T09:22:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2678v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2678v2,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.LO"
GSM based CommSense system to measure and estimate environmental changes,"Abhishek Bhatta, Amit Kumar Mishra","Facilitating the coexistence of radar systems with communication systems has been a major area of research in radar engineering. The current work presents a new way to sense the environment using the channel equalization block of existing communication systems. We have named this system CommSense. In the current paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the system using Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) signals. The implementation has been done using open-source Software Defined Radio (SDR) environment. In the preliminary results obtained in our work we show that it is possible to distinguish environmental changes using the proposed system. The major advantage of the system is that it is inexpensive as channel estimation is an inherent block in any communication system and hence the added cost to make it work as an environment sensor is minimal. The major challenge, on which we are continuing our work, is how to characterize the features in the environmental changes. This is an acute challenge given the fact that the bandwidth available is narrow and the system is inherently a forward looking radar. However the initial results, as shown in this paper, are encouraging and we intend to use an application specific instrumentation (ASIN) scheme to distinguish the environmental changes.",2016-11-08T19:18:38Z,2017-05-08T13:59:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02659v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02659v2,cs.OH
The interplay between system identification and machine learning,Gianluigi Pillonetto,"Learning from examples is one of the key problems in science and engineering. It deals with function reconstruction from a finite set of direct and noisy samples. Regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) is widely used to solve this task and includes powerful estimators such as regularization networks. Recent achievements include the proof of the statistical consistency of these kernel- based approaches. Parallel to this, many different system identification techniques have been developed but the interaction with machine learning does not appear so strong yet. One reason is that the RKHSs usually employed in machine learning do not embed the information available on dynamic systems, e.g. BIBO stability. In addition, in system identification the independent data assumptions routinely adopted in machine learning are never satisfied in practice. This paper provides new results which strengthen the connection between system identification and machine learning. Our starting point is the introduction of RKHSs of dynamic systems. They contain functionals over spaces defined by system inputs and allow to interpret system identification as learning from examples. In both linear and nonlinear settings, it is shown that this perspective permits to derive in a relatively simple way conditions on RKHS stability (i.e. the property of containing only BIBO stable systems or predictors), also facilitating the design of new kernels for system identification. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the regularized estimator to the optimal predictor under conditions typical of dynamic systems.",2016-12-29T14:32:51Z,2016-12-29T14:32:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09158v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09158v1,"cs.SY, cs.LG, stat.ML"
Application of Fuzzy Assessing for Reliability Decision Making,"Shoele Jamali, Mehrdad J. Bani","This paper proposes a new fuzzy assessing procedure with application in management decision making. The proposed fuzzy approach build the membership functions for system characteristics of a standby repairable system. This method is used to extract a family of conventional crisp intervals from the fuzzy repairable system for the desired system characteristics. This can be determined with a set of nonlinear parametric programing using the membership functions. When system characteristics are governed by the membership functions, more information is provided for use by management, and because the redundant system is extended to the fuzzy environment, general repairable systems are represented more accurately and the analytic results are more useful for designers and practitioners. Also beside standby, active redundancy systems are used in many cases so this article has many practical instances. Different from other studies, our model provides, a good estimated value based on uncertain environments, a comparison discussion of using fuzzy theory and conventional method and also a comparison between parallel (active redundancy) and series system in fuzzy world when we have standby redundancy. When the membership function intervals cannot be inverted explicitly, system management or designers can specify the system characteristics of interest, perform numerical calculations, examine the corresponding {\alpha}-cuts, and use this information to develop or improve system processes.",2017-07-06T10:47:08Z,2017-07-06T10:47:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01727v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01727v1,cs.AI
A Game-theoretic Framework for Revenue Sharing in Edge-Cloud Computing   System,"Zhi Cao, Honggang Zhang, Benyuan Liu, Bo Sheng","We introduce a game-theoretic framework to ex- plore revenue sharing in an Edge-Cloud computing system, in which computing service providers at the edge of the Internet (edge providers) and computing service providers at the cloud (cloud providers) co-exist and collectively provide computing resources to clients (e.g., end users or applications) at the edge. Different from traditional cloud computing, the providers in an Edge-Cloud system are independent and self-interested. To achieve high system-level efficiency, the manager of the system adopts a task distribution mechanism to maximize the total revenue received from clients and also adopts a revenue sharing mechanism to split the received revenue among computing servers (and hence service providers). Under those system-level mechanisms, service providers attempt to game with the system in order to maximize their own utilities, by strategically allocating their resources (e.g., computing servers).   Our framework models the competition among the providers in an Edge-Cloud system as a non-cooperative game. Our simulations and experiments on an emulation system have shown the existence of Nash equilibrium in such a game. We find that revenue sharing mechanisms have a significant impact on the system-level efficiency at Nash equilibria, and surprisingly the revenue sharing mechanism based directly on actual contributions can result in significantly worse system efficiency than Shapley value sharing mechanism and Ortmann proportional sharing mechanism. Our framework provides an effective economics approach to understanding and designing efficient Edge-Cloud computing systems.",2017-11-28T03:29:24Z,2018-10-05T03:12:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10102v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10102v2,"cs.GT, cs.DC, cs.NI"
Component response rate variation underlies the stability of highly   complex finite systems,A. Bradley Duthie,"The stability of a complex system generally decreases with increasing system size and interconnectivity, a counterintuitive result of widespread importance across the physical, life, and social sciences. Despite recent interest in the relationship between system properties and stability, the effect of variation in response rate across system components remains unconsidered. Here I vary the component response rates ($\boldsymbol{\gamma}$) of randomly generated complex systems. I use numerical simulations to show that when component response rates vary, the potential for system stability increases. These results are robust to common network structures, including small-world and scale-free networks, and cascade food webs. Variation in $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ is especially important for stability in highly complex systems, in which the probability of stability would otherwise be negligible. At such extremes of simulated system complexity, the largest stable complex systems would be unstable if not for variation in $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$. My results therefore reveal a previously unconsidered aspect of system stability that is likely to be pervasive across all realistic complex systems.",2018-06-04T09:47:26Z,2020-05-04T15:13:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01029v7,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01029v7,"q-bio.PE, q-bio.MN, q-bio.NC"
Reinforcement Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning with System 1   and System 2,Alexander Peysakhovich,"Inferring a person's goal from their behavior is an important problem in applications of AI (e.g. automated assistants, recommender systems). The workhorse model for this task is the rational actor model - this amounts to assuming that people have stable reward functions, discount the future exponentially, and construct optimal plans. Under the rational actor assumption techniques such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) can be used to infer a person's goals from their actions. A competing model is the dual-system model. Here decisions are the result of an interplay between a fast, automatic, heuristic-based system 1 and a slower, deliberate, calculating system 2. We generalize the dual system framework to the case of Markov decision problems and show how to compute optimal plans for dual-system agents. We show that dual-system agents exhibit behaviors that are incompatible with rational actor assumption. We show that naive applications of rational-actor IRL to the behavior of dual-system agents can generate wrong inference about the agents' goals and suggest interventions that actually reduce the agent's overall utility. Finally, we adapt a simple IRL algorithm to correctly infer the goals of dual system decision-makers. This allows us to make interventions that help, rather than hinder, the dual-system agent's ability to reach their true goals.",2018-11-19T22:36:53Z,2019-03-13T18:41:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08549v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08549v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.GT, stat.ML"
Reduction of a nonlinear system and its numerical solution using a   fractional iterative method,"A. Torres-Hernandez, F. Brambila-Paz, P. M. Rodrigo","A nonlinear algebraic equation system of 5 variables is numerically solved, which is derived from the application of the Fourier transform to a differential equation system that allows modeling the behavior of the temperatures and the efficiencies of a hybrid solar receiver, which in simple terms is the combination of a photovoltaic system with a thermoelectric system. In addition, a way to reduce the previous system to a nonlinear system of only 2 variables is presented. Naturally, reducing algebraic equation systems of dimension N to systems of smaller dimensions has the main advantage of reducing the number of variables involved in a problem, but the analytical expressions of the systems become more complicated. However, to minimize this disadvantage, an iterative method that does not explicitly depend on the analytical complexity of the system to be solved is used. A fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems is presented.",2020-07-02T01:39:39Z,2024-07-25T17:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02776v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02776v4,"math.NA, cs.NA, math.FA"
Opacity of Discrete Event Systems with Active Intruder,"Alireza Partovi, Taeho Jung, Lin Hai","Opacity is a security property formalizing the information leakage of a system to an external observer, namely intruder. The conventional opacity that has been studied in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature usually assumes passive intruders, who only observe the behavior of the system. However, in many cybersecurity concerns, such as web service, active intruders, who are capable of influencing the system's behavior beyond passive observations, need to be considered and defended against. We are therefore motivated to extend the opacity notions to handle active intruders. For this, we model the system as a non-deterministic finite-state transducer. It is assumed that the intruder has a full knowledge of the system structure and is capable of interacting with the system by injecting different inputs and observing its responses. In this setup, we first introduce reactive current-state opacity (RCSO) notion characterizing a property that the system does not leak its secret state regardless of how the intruder manipulates the system behavior. We furthermore extend this notion to language-based and initial-state reactive opacity notions, and study the relationship among them. It turns out that all the proposed reactive opacity notions are equivalent to RCSO. We therefore focus on RCSO and study its verification problem. It is shown that the RCSO can be verified by constructing an observer automaton.",2020-07-24T20:27:26Z,2020-07-24T20:27:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14960v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14960v1,"cs.LO, cs.SY, eess.SY"
A Formal Framework for Reasoning about Agents' Independence in   Self-organizing Multi-agent Systems,"Jieting Luo, Beishui Liao, John-Jules Meyer","Self-organization is a process where a stable pattern is formed by the cooperative behavior between parts of an initially disordered system without external control or influence. It has been introduced to multi-agent systems as an internal control process or mechanism to solve difficult problems spontaneously. However, because a self-organizing multi-agent system has autonomous agents and local interactions between them, it is difficult to predict the behavior of the system from the behavior of the local agents we design. This paper proposes a logic-based framework of self-organizing multi-agent systems, where agents interact with each other by following their prescribed local rules. The dependence relation between coalitions of agents regarding their contributions to the global behavior of the system is reasoned about from the structural and semantic perspectives. We show that the computational complexity of verifying such a self-organizing multi-agent system is in exponential time. We then combine our framework with graph theory to decompose a system into different coalitions located in different layers, which allows us to verify agents' full contributions more efficiently.

Optimal Fine-grained Hardness of Approximation of Linear Equations,"Mitali Bafna, Nikhil Vyas","The problem of solving linear systems is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science, where given a satisfiable linear system $(A,b)$, for $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we wish to find a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $Ax = b$. The current best algorithms for solving dense linear systems reduce the problem to matrix multiplication, and run in time $O(n^{\omega})$. We consider the problem of finding $\varepsilon$-approximate solutions to linear systems with respect to the $L_2$-norm, that is, given a satisfiable linear system $(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}, b \in \mathbb{R}^n)$, find an $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $||Ax - b||_2 \leq \varepsilon||b||_2$. Our main result is a fine-grained reduction from computing the rank of a matrix to finding $\varepsilon$-approximate solutions to linear systems. In particular, if the best known $O(n^\omega)$ time algorithm for computing the rank of $n \times O(n)$ matrices is optimal (which we conjecture is true), then finding an $\varepsilon$-approximate solution to a dense linear system also requires $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{\omega})$ time, even for $\varepsilon$ as large as $(1 - 1/\text{poly}(n))$. We also prove (under some modified conjectures for the rank-finding problem) optimal hardness of approximation for sparse linear systems, linear systems over positive semidefinite matrices, well-conditioned linear systems, and approximately solving linear systems with respect to the $L_p$-norm, for $p \geq 1$. At the heart of our results is a novel reduction from the rank problem to a decision version of the approximate linear systems problem. This reduction preserves properties such as matrix sparsity and bit complexity.",2021-06-24T17:43:57Z,2021-06-24T17:43:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13210v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13210v1,"cs.DS, cs.CC"
Verifying Switched System Stability With Logic,"Yong Kiam Tan, Stefan Mitsch, André Platzer","Switched systems are known to exhibit subtle (in)stability behaviors requiring system designers to carefully analyze the stability of closed-loop systems that arise from their proposed switching control laws. This paper presents a formal approach for verifying switched system stability that blends classical ideas from the controls and verification literature using differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for deductive verification of hybrid systems. From controls, we use standard stability notions for various classes of switching mechanisms and their corresponding Lyapunov function-based analysis techniques. From verification, we use dL's ability to verify quantified properties of hybrid systems and dL models of switched systems as looping hybrid programs whose stability can be formally specified and proven by finding appropriate loop invariants, i.e., properties that are preserved across each loop iteration. This blend of ideas enables a trustworthy implementation of switched system stability verification in the KeYmaera X prover based on dL. For standard classes of switching mechanisms, the implementation provides fully automated stability proofs, including searching for suitable Lyapunov functions. Moreover, the generality of the deductive approach also enables verification of switching control laws that require non-standard stability arguments through the design of loop invariants that suitably express specific intuitions behind those control laws. This flexibility is demonstrated on three case studies: a model for longitudinal flight control by Branicky, an automatic cruise controller, and Brockett's nonholonomic integrator.",2021-11-02T22:40:29Z,2022-04-08T19:09:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01928v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01928v2,"eess.SY, cs.LO, cs.SY, 03B70, 34A38, 93C30, F.3.1; F.4.1; G.1.7; I.2.3"
Parameter Inference of Time Series by Delay Embeddings and Learning   Differentiable Operators,"Alex Tong Lin, Adrian S. Wong, Robert Martin, Stanley J. Osher, Daniel Eckhardt","We provide a method to identify system parameters of dynamical systems, called ID-ODE -- Inference by Differentiation and Observing Delay Embeddings. In this setting, we are given a dataset of trajectories from a dynamical system with system parameter labels. Our goal is to identify system parameters of new trajectories. The given trajectories may or may not encompass the full state of the system, and we may only observe a one-dimensional time series. In the latter case, we reconstruct the full state by using delay embeddings, and under sufficient conditions, Taken's Embedding Theorem assures us the reconstruction is diffeomorphic to the original. This allows our method to work on time series. Our method works by first learning the velocity operator (as given or reconstructed) with a neural network having both state and system parameters as variable inputs. Then on new trajectories we backpropagate prediction errors to the system parameter inputs giving us a gradient. We then use gradient descent to infer the correct system parameter. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on many numerical examples: the Lorenz system, Lorenz96, Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey, and the Compound Double Pendulum.

System Network Analytics: Evolution and Stable Rules of a State Series,"Animesh Chaturvedi, Aruna Tiwari, Nicolas Spyratos","System Evolution Analytics on a system that evolves is a challenge because it makes a State Series SS = {S1, S2... SN} (i.e., a set of states ordered by time) with several inter-connected entities changing over time. We present stability characteristics of interesting evolution rules occurring in multiple states. We defined an evolution rule with its stability as the fraction of states in which the rule is interesting. Extensively, we defined stable rule as the evolution rule having stability that exceeds a given threshold minimum stability (minStab). We also defined persistence metric, a quantitative measure of persistent entity-connections. We explain this with an approach and algorithm for System Network Analytics (SysNet-Analytics), which uses minStab to retrieve Network Evolution Rules (NERs) and Stable NERs (SNERs). The retrieved information is used to calculate a proposed System Network Persistence (SNP) metric. This work is automated as a SysNet-Analytics Tool to demonstrate application on real world systems including: software system, natural-language system, retail market system, and IMDb system.

Closed-Loop Koopman Operator Approximation,"Steven Dahdah, James Richard Forbes","This paper proposes a method to identify a Koopman model of a feedback-controlled system given a known controller. The Koopman operator allows a nonlinear system to be rewritten as an infinite-dimensional linear system by viewing it in terms of an infinite set of lifting functions. A finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator can be identified from data by choosing a finite subset of lifting functions and solving a regression problem in the lifted space. Existing methods are designed to identify open-loop systems. However, it is impractical or impossible to run experiments on some systems, such as unstable systems, in an open-loop fashion. The proposed method leverages the linearity of the Koopman operator, along with knowledge of the controller and the structure of the closed-loop system, to simultaneously identify the closed-loop and plant systems. The advantages of the proposed closed-loop Koopman operator approximation method are demonstrated in simulation using a Duffing oscillator and experimentally using a rotary inverted pendulum system. An open-source software implementation of the proposed method is publicly available, along with the experimental dataset generated for this paper.",2023-03-27T15:20:10Z,2024-05-01T17:34:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15318v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15318v3,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY, math.DS"
Verifying the Unknown: Correct-by-Design Control Synthesis for Networks   of Stochastic Uncertain Systems,"Oliver Schön, Birgit van Huijgevoort, Sofie Haesaert, Sadegh Soudjani","In this paper, we present an approach for designing correct-by-design controllers for cyber-physical systems composed of multiple dynamically interconnected uncertain systems. We consider networked discrete-time uncertain nonlinear systems with additive stochastic noise and model parametric uncertainty. Such settings arise when multiple systems interact in an uncertain environment and only observational data is available. We address two limitations of existing approaches for formal synthesis of controllers for networks of uncertain systems satisfying complex temporal specifications. Firstly, whilst existing approaches rely on the stochasticity to be Gaussian, the heterogeneous nature of composed systems typically yields a more complex stochastic behavior. Secondly, exact models of the systems involved are generally not available or difficult to acquire. To address these challenges, we show how abstraction-based control synthesis for uncertain systems based on sub-probability couplings can be extended to networked systems. We design controllers based on parameter uncertainty sets identified from observational data and approximate possibly arbitrary noise distributions using Gaussian mixture models whilst quantifying the incurred stochastic coupling. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a nonlinear package delivery case study with a complex specification, and a platoon of cars.",2023-09-03T21:57:34Z,2023-09-03T21:57:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01276v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01276v1,"eess.SY, cs.LO, cs.SC, cs.SY"
Measuring Robustness in Cyber-Physical Systems under Sensor Attacks,"Jian Xiang, Ruggero Lanotte, Simone Tini, Stephen Chong, Massimo Merro","This paper contributes a formal framework for quantitative analysis of bounded sensor attacks on cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of differential dynamic logic. Given a precondition and postcondition of a system, we formalize two quantitative safety notions, quantitative forward and backward safety, which respectively express (1) how strong the strongest postcondition of the system is with respect to the specified postcondition, and (2) how strong the specified precondition is with respect to the weakest precondition of the system needed to ensure the specified postcondition holds. We introduce two notions, forward and backward robustness, to characterize the robustness of a system against sensor attacks as the loss of safety. To reason about robustness, we introduce two simulation distances, forward and backward simulation distances, which are defined based on the behavioral distances between the original system and the system with compromised sensors. Forward and backward distances, respectively, characterize upper bounds of the degree of forward and backward safety loss caused by the sensor attacks. We verify the two simulation distances by expressing them as modalities, i.e., formulas of differential dynamic logic, and develop an ad-hoc proof system to reason with such formulas. We showcase our formal notions and reasoning techniques on two non-trivial case studies: an autonomous vehicle that needs to avoid collision and a water tank system.",2024-03-09T07:47:29Z,2024-03-09T07:47:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05829v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05829v1,"eess.SY, cs.CR, cs.ET, cs.LO, cs.SY"
"Enhancing Resilience and Scalability in Travel Booking Systems: A   Microservices Approach to Fault Tolerance, Load Balancing, and Service   Discovery","Biman Barua, M. Shamim Kaiser","This paper investigates the inclusion of microservices architecture in the development of scalable and reliable airline reservation systems. Most of the traditional reservation systems are very rigid and centralized which makes them prone to bottlenecks and a single point of failure. As such, systems do not meet the requirements of modern airlines which are dynamic. Microservices offer better resiliency and scalability because the services do not depend on one another and can be deployed independently. The approach is grounded on the Circuit Breaker Pattern to maintain fault tolerance while consuming foreign resources such as flight APIs and payment systems. This avoided the failure propagation to the systems by 60% enabling the systems to function under external failures. Traffic rerouting also bolstered this with a guarantee of above 99.95% uptime in systems where high availability was demanded. To address this, load balancing was used, particularly the Round-Robin method which managed to enhance performance by 35% through the equal distribution of user requests among the service instances. Health checks, as well as monitoring in real-time, helped as well with failure management as they helped to contain failures before the users of the system were affected. The results suggest that the use of microservices led to a 40% increase in system scalability, a 50% decrease in downtime and a support for 30% more concurrent users than the use of monolithic architectures. These findings affirm the capability of microservices in the development of robust and flexible airline ticket booking systems that are responsive to change and recover from external system unavailability.",2024-10-25T17:19:42Z,2024-10-25T17:19:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19701v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19701v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CE, cs.LG"

Identifying the minimal set of units to attack to disintegrate a complex network, i.e. network dismantling, is a computationally challenging (NP-hard) problem which is usually attacked with heuristics. Here, we show that a machine trained to dismantle relatively small systems is able to identify higher-order topological patterns, allowing to disintegrate large-scale social, infrastructural and technological networks more efficiently than human-based heuristics. Remarkably, the machine assesses the probability that next attacks will disintegrate the system, providing a quantitative method to quantify systemic risk and detect early-warning signals of system's collapse. This demonstrates that machine-assisted analysis can be effectively used for policy and decision making to better quantify the fragility of complex systems and their response to shocks.",2021-01-07T09:39:13Z,2021-01-07T09:39:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02453v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.LG"
A Tensor-Based Formulation of Hetero-functional Graph Theory,"Amro M. Farid, Dakota Thompson, Wester Schoonenberg","Recently, hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT) has developed as a means to mathematically model the structure of large-scale complex flexible engineering systems. It does so by fusing concepts from network science and model-based systems engineering (MBSE). For the former, it utilizes multiple graph-based data structures to support a matrix-based quantitative analysis. For the latter, HFGT inherits the heterogeneity of conceptual and ontological constructs found in model-based systems engineering including system form, system function, and system concept. These diverse conceptual constructs indicate multi-dimensional rather than two-dimensional relationships. This paper provides the first tensor-based treatment of hetero-functional graph theory. In particular, it addresses the ``system concept"" and the hetero-functional adjacency matrix from the perspective of tensors and introduces the hetero-functional incidence tensor as a new data structure. The tensor-based formulation described in this work makes a stronger tie between HFGT and its ontological foundations in MBSE.

In mathematical terms, we reformulate some existing operads of wiring diagrams and introduce new ones, using the general formalism of C-sets (copresheaves). We then establish dynamical systems as algebras of these operads.

Our proof calculus uses a resource logic, in the spirit of Separation Logic, to give local specifications of reconfiguration actions. Moreover, distributed systems with an unbounded number of components are described using inductively defined predicates. The correctness of reconfiguration programs relies on havoc invariants, that are assertions about the ongoing interactions in a part of the system that is not affected by the structural change caused by the reconfiguration. We present a proof system for such invariants in an assume/rely-guarantee style.

A model of systems with modes and mode transitions,"Edwin Beggs, John V. Tucker","We propose a method of classifying the operation of a system into finitely many modes. Each mode has its own objectives for the system's behaviour and its own mathematical models and algorithms designed to accomplish its objectives. A central problem is deciding when to transition from one mode to some other mode, a decision that may be contested and involve partial or inconsistent information or evidence. We model formally the concept of modes for a system and derive a family of data types for analysing mode transitions. The data types are simplicial complexes, both abstract and realised in euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In the data type, a mode is represented by a simplex. Each state of a system can be evaluated relative to different modes by mapping it into one or more simplices. This calibration measures the extent to which distinct modes are appropriate for the state and can decide on a transition. We explain this methodology based on modes, introduce the mathematical ideas about simplicial objects we need and use them to build a theoretical framework for modes and mode transitions. To illustrate the general model in some detail, we work though a case study of an autonomous racing car.",2021-07-13T15:04:49Z,2021-07-13T15:04:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06152v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06152v1,"cs.LO, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Verification and Optimization of Cyber-Physical Systems: Preprint for   FedCSIS,"Reza Soltani, Eun-Young Kang, Juan Esteban Heredia Mena","Optimizing CPS behavior in terms of energy consumption can have a significant impact on system reliability. The environment influences the system's behavior, and neglecting the environmental behavior has an indirect negative impact on optimizing the system's behavior. In this work, to increase the system's flexibility, the behavior of the environment is modeled dynamically to apply the disorderliness of its behavior. The resulting models are formally verified.

Constructing Neural Network-Based Models for Simulating Dynamical   Systems,"Christian Møldrup Legaard, Thomas Schranz, Gerald Schweiger, Ján Drgoňa, Basak Falay, Cláudio Gomes, Alexandros Iosifidis, Mahdi Abkar, Peter Gorm Larsen","Dynamical systems see widespread use in natural sciences like physics, biology, chemistry, as well as engineering disciplines such as circuit analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and control. For simple systems, the differential equations governing the dynamics can be derived by applying fundamental physical laws. However, for more complex systems, this approach becomes exceedingly difficult. Data-driven modeling is an alternative paradigm that seeks to learn an approximation of the dynamics of a system using observations of the true system. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in data-driven modeling techniques, in particular neural networks have proven to provide an effective framework for solving a wide range of tasks. This paper provides a survey of the different ways to construct models of dynamical systems using neural networks. In addition to the basic overview, we review the related literature and outline the most significant challenges from numerical simulations that this modeling paradigm must overcome. Based on the reviewed literature and identified challenges, we provide a discussion on promising research areas.",2021-11-02T10:51:42Z,2022-07-22T21:38:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01495v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01495v2,cs.LG
Learning algorithms versus automatability of Frege systems,"Ján Pich, Rahul Santhanam","We connect learning algorithms and algorithms automating proof search in propositional proof systems: for every sufficiently strong, well-behaved propositional proof system $P$, we prove that the following statements are equivalent,   1. Provable learning: $P$ proves efficiently that p-size circuits are learnable by subexponential-size circuits over the uniform distribution with membership queries.   2. Provable automatability: $P$ proves efficiently that $P$ is automatable by non-uniform circuits on propositional formulas expressing p-size circuit lower bounds.   Here, $P$ is sufficiently strong and well-behaved if I.-III. holds: I. $P$ p-simulates Je\v{r}\'abek's system $WF$ (which strengthens the Extended Frege system $EF$ by a surjective weak pigeonhole principle); II. $P$ satisfies some basic properties of standard proof systems which p-simulate $WF$; III. $P$ proves efficiently for some Boolean function $h$ that $h$ is hard on average for circuits of subexponential size. For example, if III. holds for $P=WF$, then Items 1 and 2 are equivalent for $P=WF$.   If there is a function $h\in NE\cap coNE$ which is hard on average for circuits of size $2^{n/4}$, for each sufficiently big $n$, then there is an explicit propositional proof system $P$ satisfying properties I.-III., i.e. the equivalence of Items 1 and 2 holds for $P$.",2021-11-20T16:42:55Z,2021-11-20T16:42:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10626v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10626v1,"cs.CC, cs.LG, cs.LO"
TSO-DSOs Stable Cost Allocation for the Joint Procurement of   Flexibility: A Cooperative Game Approach,"Anibal Sanjab, Hélène Le Cadre, Yuting Mou","In this paper, a transmission-distribution systems flexibility market is introduced, in which system operators (SOs) jointly procure flexibility from different systems to meet their needs (balancing and congestion management) using a common market. This common market is, then, formulated as a cooperative game aiming at identifying a stable and efficient split of costs of the jointly procured flexibility among the participating SOs to incentivize their cooperation. The non-emptiness of the core of this game is then mathematically proven, implying the stability of the game and the naturally-arising incentive for cooperation among the SOs. Several cost allocation mechanisms are then introduced, while characterizing their mathematical properties. Numerical results focusing on an interconnected system (composed of the IEEE 14-bus transmission system and the Matpower 18-bus, 69-bus, and 141-bus distributions systems) showcase the cooperation-induced reduction in system-wide flexibility procurement costs, and identifies the varying costs borne by different SOs under various cost allocations methods.",2021-11-24T22:54:37Z,2021-11-24T22:54:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12830v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12830v1,"cs.GT, cs.AI, cs.IT, econ.GN, math.IT, math.OC, q-fin.EC"
Underrepresentation of women in computer systems research,"Eitan Frachtenberg, Rhody D. Kaner","The gender gap in computer science (CS) research is a well-studied problem, with an estimated ratio of 15%--30% women researchers. However, far less is known about gender representation in specific fields within CS. Here, we investigate the gender gap in one large field, computer systems. To this end, we combined data from 53 leading systems conferences with external demographic and bibliometric data to evaluate the ratio of women authors and the factors that might affect this ratio.   Our main findings are that women represent only about 10% of systems researchers, and that this ratio is not associated with various conference factors such as size, prestige, double-blind reviewing, and inclusivity policies. Author research experience also does not significantly affect this ratio, although author country and work sector do.   The 10% ratio of women authors is significantly lower than that of CS as a whole. Our findings suggest that focusing on inclusivity policies alone cannot address this large gap. Increasing women's participation in systems research will require addressing the systemic causes of their exclusion, which are even more pronounced in systems than in the rest of CS.",2022-01-05T18:42:21Z,2022-01-05T18:42:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01757v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01757v1,cs.DL
A study for recovering the cut-elimination property in cyclic proof   systems by restricting the arity of inductive predicates,"Yukihiro Masuoka, Daisuke Kimura","The framework of cyclic proof systems provides a reasonable proof system for logics with inductive definitions. It also offers an effective automated proof search procedure for such logics without finding induction hypotheses. Recent researches have shown that the cut-elimination property, one of the most fundamental properties in proof theory, of cyclic proof systems for several logics does not hold. These results suggest that a naive proof search, which avoids the Cut rule, is not enough.   This paper shows that the cut-elimination property still fails in a simple cyclic proof system even if we restrict languages to unary inductive predicates and unary functions, aiming to clarify why the cut-elimination property fails in the cyclic proof systems. The result in this paper is a sharper one than that of the first authors' previous result, which gave a counterexample using two ternary inductive predicates and a unary function symbol to show the failure of the cut-elimination property in the cyclic proof system of the first-order logic.",2022-03-11T08:14:05Z,2022-03-11T08:14:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05791v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05791v1,"cs.LO, math.LO"
Continuity scaling: A rigorous framework for detecting and quantifying   causality accurately,"Xiong Ying, Si-Yang Leng, Huan-Fei Ma, Qing Nie, Ying-Cheng Lai, Wei Lin","Data based detection and quantification of causation in complex, nonlinear dynamical systems is of paramount importance to science, engineering and beyond. Inspired by the widely used methodology in recent years, the cross-map-based techniques, we develop a general framework to advance towards a comprehensive understanding of dynamical causal mechanisms, which is consistent with the natural interpretation of causality. In particular, instead of measuring the smoothness of the cross map as conventionally implemented, we define causation through measuring the {\it scaling law} for the continuity of the investigated dynamical system directly. The uncovered scaling law enables accurate, reliable, and efficient detection of causation and assessment of its strength in general complex dynamical systems, outperforming those existing representative methods. The continuity scaling based framework is rigorously established and demonstrated using datasets from model complex systems and the real world.",2022-03-26T07:03:52Z,2022-03-26T07:03:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14006v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14006v1,"math.DS, cs.SY, eess.SY, physics.data-an, q-bio.QM"
A meta-probabilistic-programming language for bisimulation of   probabilistic and non-well-founded type systems,"Jonathan Warrell, Alexey Potapov, Adam Vandervorst, Ben Goertzel","We introduce a formal meta-language for probabilistic programming, capable of expressing both programs and the type systems in which they are embedded. We are motivated here by the desire to allow an AGI to learn not only relevant knowledge (programs/proofs), but also appropriate ways of reasoning (logics/type systems). We draw on the frameworks of cubical type theory and dependent typed metagraphs to formalize our approach. In doing so, we show that specific constructions within the meta-language can be related via bisimulation (implying path equivalence) to the type systems they correspond. This allows our approach to provide a convenient means of deriving synthetic denotational semantics for various type systems. Particularly, we derive bisimulations for pure type systems (PTS), and probabilistic dependent type systems (PDTS). We discuss further the relationship of PTS to non-well-founded set theory, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with an implementation of a bisimulation proof in a Guarded Cubical Type Theory type checker.",2022-03-30T01:07:37Z,2022-08-16T06:07:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15970v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15970v3,"cs.AI, cs.FL, cs.LO"
Robust Event-Driven Interactions in Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning,"Daniel Jarne Ornia, Manuel Mazo Jr","We present an approach to reduce the communication required between agents in a Multi-Agent learning system by exploiting the inherent robustness of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We compute so-called robustness surrogate functions (off-line), that give agents a conservative indication of how far their state measurements can deviate before they need to update other agents in the system. This results in fully distributed decision functions, enabling agents to decide when it is necessary to update others. We derive bounds on the optimality of the resulting systems in terms of the discounted sum of rewards obtained, and show these bounds are a function of the design parameters. Additionally, we extend the results for the case where the robustness surrogate functions are learned from data, and present experimental results demonstrating a significant reduction in communication events between agents.",2022-04-07T11:00:39Z,2022-09-07T13:01:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03361v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03361v2,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Dependence Logics in Temporal Settings,"Alexandru Baltag, Johan van Benthem, Dazhu Li","Many forms of dependence manifest themselves over time, with behavior of variables in dynamical systems as a paradigmatic example. This paper studies temporal dependence in dynamical systems from a logical perspective, by enriching a minimal modal base logic of static functional dependencies. We first introduce a logic for dynamical systems featuring temporalized variables, provide a complete axiomatic proof calculus, and show that its satisfiability problem is decidable. Then, to capture explicit reasoning about dynamic transition functions, we enhance the framework with function symbols and term identity. Next we combine temporalized variables with a modality for next-time truth from standard temporal logic, where modal correspondence analysis reveals the principles needed for a complete and decidable logic of timed dynamical systems supporting reductions between the two ways of referring to time. Our final result is an axiomatization of a general decidable logic of dependencies in arbitrary dynamical systems. We conclude with a brief outlook on how the systems introduced here mesh with richer temporal logics of system behavior, and with dynamic topological logic.",2022-04-16T16:27:01Z,2024-03-28T02:20:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07839v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07839v2,"cs.LO, math.LO"
Unboundedness for Recursion Schemes: A Simpler Type System,"David Barozzini, Paweł Parys, Jan Wróblewski","Decidability of the problems of unboundedness and simultaneous unboundedness (aka. the diagonal problem) for higher-order recursion schemes was established by Clemente, Parys, Salvati, and Walukiewicz (2016). Then a procedure of optimal complexity was presented by Parys (2017); this procedure used a complicated type system, involving multiple flags and markers. We present here a simpler and much more intuitive type system serving the same purpose. We prove that this type system allows to solve the unboundedness problem for a widely considered subclass of recursion schemes, called safe schemes. For unsafe recursion schemes we only have soundness of the type system: if one can establish a type derivation claiming that a recursion scheme is unbounded then it is indeed unbounded. Completeness of the type system for unsafe recursion schemes is left as an open question. Going further, we discuss an extension of the type system that allows to handle the simultaneous unboundedness problem.   We also design and implement an algorithm that fully automatically checks unboundedness of a given recursion scheme, completing in a short time for a wide variety of inputs.",2022-04-23T08:48:09Z,2022-04-23T08:48:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11023v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11023v1,"cs.LO, cs.FL"
A Formal Framework for Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems,"Benjamin Lion, Farhad Arbab, Carolyn Talcott","Composition is an important feature of a specification language, as it enables the design of a complex system in terms of a product of its parts. Decomposition is equally important in order to reason about structural properties of a system. Usually, however, a system can be decomposed in more than one way, each optimizing for a different set of criteria. We extend an algebraic component-based model for cyber-physical systems to reason about decomposition. In this model, components compose using a family of algebraic products, and decompose, under some conditions, given a corresponding family of division operators. We use division to specify invariant of a system of components, and to model desirable updates. We apply our framework to design a cyber-physical system consisting of robots moving on a shared field, and identify desirable updates using our division operator.",2022-07-03T14:03:35Z,2022-07-03T14:03:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01048v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01048v1,cs.LO
A Doxastic Characterisation of Autonomous Decisive Systems,Astrid Rakow,"A highly autonomous system (HAS) has to assess the situation it is in and derive beliefs, based on which, it decides what to do next. The beliefs are not solely based on the observations the HAS has made so far, but also on general insights about the world, in which the HAS operates. These insights have either been built in the HAS during design or are provided by trusted sources during its mission. Although its beliefs may be imprecise and might bear flaws, the HAS will have to extrapolate the possible futures in order to evaluate the consequences of its actions and then take its decisions autonomously. In this paper, we formalize an autonomous decisive system as a system that always chooses actions that it currently believes are the best. We show that it can be checked whether an autonomous decisive system can be built given an application domain, the dynamically changing knowledge base and a list of LTL mission goals. We moreover can synthesize a belief formation for an autonomous decisive system. For the formal characterization, we use a doxastic framework for safety-critical HASs where the belief formation supports the HAS's extrapolation.",2022-09-28T12:24:00Z,2022-09-28T12:24:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14038v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14038v1,"cs.GT, cs.MA, cs.RO"

Gap labeling theorem for multilayer thin film heterostructures,"Mao Yoshii, Sota Kitamura, Takahiro Morimoto","Quasiperiodic systems show a universal gap structure due to quasiperiodicity which is analogous to gap openings at the Brillouin zone boundary in periodic systems. The integrated density of states (IDoS) below those energy gaps are characterized by a few integers, which is known as the ``gap labeling theorem'' (GLT) for quasiperiodic systems. In this study, focusing on multilayer thin film systems such as twisted bilayer graphene and stacked transition metal dichalcogenides, we extend the GLT for multilayer systems of arbitrary dimensions and number of layers, using an approach based on the algebra called ``a noncommutative torus''. We find that the energy gaps and the associated IDoS are generally characterized by $_{DN}C_D$ integer labels in $N$ layer systems in the $D$ dimensions, when the effect of the interlayer coupling can be approximated by a quasiperiodic intralayer coupling for each layer.

Localization and Navigation System for Indoor Mobile Robot,Yanbaihui Liu,"Visually impaired people usually find it hard to travel independently in many public places such as airports and shopping malls due to the problems of obstacle avoidance and guidance to the desired location. Therefore, in the highly dynamic indoor environment, how to improve indoor navigation robot localization and navigation accuracy so that they guide the visually impaired well becomes a problem. One way is to use visual SLAM. However, typical visual SLAM either assumes a static environment, which may lead to less accurate results in dynamic environments or assumes that the targets are all dynamic and removes all the feature points above, sacrificing computational speed to a large extent with the available computational power. This paper seeks to explore marginal localization and navigation systems for indoor navigation robotics. The proposed system is designed to improve localization and navigation accuracy in highly dynamic environments by identifying and tracking potentially moving objects and using vector field histograms for local path planning and obstacle avoidance. The system has been tested on a public indoor RGB-D dataset, and the results show that the new system improves accuracy and robustness while reducing computation time in highly dynamic indoor scenes.",2022-12-13T06:03:35Z,2022-12-13T06:03:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06391v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06391v1,"cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY"

An Approach to Stochastic Dynamic Games with Asymmetric Information and   Hidden Actions,"Yi Ouyang, Hamidreza Tavafoghi, Demosthenis Teneketzis","We consider in discrete time, a general class of sequential stochastic dynamic games with asymmetric information with the following features. The underlying system has Markovian dynamics controlled by the agents' joint actions. Each agent's instantaneous utility depends on the current system state and the agents' joint actions. At each time instant each agent makes a private noisy observation of the current system state and the agents' actions in the previous time instant. In addition, at each time instant all agents have a common noisy observation of the current system state and their actions in the previous time instant. Each agent's actions are part of his private information. The objective is to determine Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) strategy profiles that are based on a compressed version of the agents' information and can be sequentially computed; such BNE strategy profiles may not always exist. We present an approach/methodology that achieves the above-stated objective, along with an instance of a game where BNE strategy profiles with the above-mentioned characteristics exist.

The Cost of Informing Decision-Makers in Multi-Agent Maximum Coverage   Problems with Random Resource Values,"Bryce L. Ferguson, Dario Paccagnan, Jason R.

Therefore, one may expect that providing decision-makers with more information will improve system performance; in this work, we find that this is not necessarily the case. In multi-agent maximum coverage problems, we find that even when agents' objectives are aligned with the global welfare, informing agents about the realization of the resource's random values can reduce equilibrium performance by a factor of 1/2. This affirms an important aspect of designing distributed systems: information need be shared carefully. We further this understanding by providing lower and upper bounds on the ratio of system welfare when information is (fully or partially) revealed and when it is not, termed the value-of-informing.

Composing larger models from smaller ones could solve this, but our current MBT conformance relation $\textbf{uioco}$ is not compositional, i.e. correctly tested components, when composed into a system, can still lead to a faulty system. To catch these integration problems, we introduce a new relation over component models called $\textbf{mutual acceptance}$. Mutually accepting components are guaranteed to communicate correctly, which makes MBT compositional. In addition to providing compositionality, mutual acceptance has benefits when retesting systems with updated components, and when diagnosing systems consisting of components.",2023-07-07T16:23:56Z,2023-07-07T16:23:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03701v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03701v1,"cs.SE, D.2.5"

Electronic Structure Prediction of Multi-million Atom Systems Through   Uncertainty Quantification Enabled Transfer Learning,"Shashank Pathrudkar, Ponkrshnan Thiagarajan, Shivang Agarwal, Amartya S. Banerjee, Susanta Ghosh","The ground state electron density -- obtainable using Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) simulations -- contains a wealth of material information, making its prediction via machine learning (ML) models attractive. However, the computational expense of KS-DFT scales cubically with system size which tends to stymie training data generation, making it difficult to develop quantifiably accurate ML models that are applicable across many scales and system configurations. Here, we address this fundamental challenge by employing transfer learning to leverage the multi-scale nature of the training data, while comprehensively sampling system configurations using thermalization. Our ML models are less reliant on heuristics, and being based on Bayesian neural networks, enable uncertainty quantification. We show that our models incur significantly lower data generation costs while allowing confident -- and when verifiable, accurate -- predictions for a wide variety of bulk systems well beyond training, including systems with defects, different alloy compositions, and at unprecedented, multi-million-atom scales. Moreover, such predictions can be carried out using only modest computational resources.",2023-08-24T21:41:29Z,2024-05-01T13:16:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13096v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13096v3,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.comp-ph, quant-ph"

Modular Analysis of Distributed Hybrid Systems using Post-Regions (Full   Version),Eduard Kamburjan,"We introduce a new approach to analyze distributed hybrid systems by a generalization of rely-guarantee reasoning. First, we give a system for deductive verification of class invariants and method contracts in object-oriented distributed hybrid systems. In a hybrid setting, the object invariant must not only be the post-condition of a method, but also has to hold in the post-region of a method. The post-region describes all reachable states after method termination before another process is guaranteed to run. The system naturally generalizes rely-guarantee reasoning of discrete object-oriented languages to hybrid systems and carries over its modularity to hybrid systems: Only one dL-proof obligation is generated per method. The post-region can be approximated using lightweight analyses and we give a general notion of soundness for such analyses. Post-region based verification is implemented for the Hybrid Active Object language HABS.",2023-09-19T09:39:09Z,2023-09-19T09:39:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10470v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10470v1,cs.LO
Towards Energysheds: A Technical Definition and Cooperative Framework   for Future Power System Operations,"Dakota Hamilton, Samuel Chevalier, Amritanshu Pandey, Mads Almassalkhi","There is growing interest in understanding how interactions between system-wide objectives and local community decision-making will impact the clean energy transition. The concept of energysheds has gained traction in the areas of public policy and social science as a way to study these relationships. However, development of technical definitions of energysheds that permit system analysis are still largely missing. In this work, we propose a mathematical definition for energysheds, and introduce an analytical framework for studying energyshed concepts within the context of future electric power system operations. This framework is used to develop insights into the factors that impact a community's ability to achieve energyshed policy incentives within a larger connected power grid, as well as the tradeoffs associated with different spatial policy requirements. We also propose an optimization-based energyshed policy design problem, and show that it can be solved to global optimality within arbitrary precision by employing concepts from quasi-convex optimization. Finally, we investigate how interconnected energysheds can cooperatively achieve their objectives in bulk power system operations.",2023-11-27T20:24:17Z,2024-04-29T19:10:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16300v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16300v2,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Energy-consistent integration of mechanical systems based on Livens   principle,"Philipp L. Kinon, Peter Betsch","In this work we make use of Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton-Pontryagin principle) in order to obtain a novel structure-preserving integrator for mechanical systems. In contrast to the canonical Hamiltonian equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equations pertaining to Livens principle circumvent the need to invert the mass matrix. This is an essential advantage with respect to singular mass matrices, which can yield severe difficulties for the modelling and simulation of multibody systems. Moreover, Livens principle unifies both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian viewpoints on mechanics. Additionally, the present framework avoids the need to set up the system's Hamiltonian. The novel scheme algorithmically conserves a general energy function and aims at the preservation of momentum maps corresponding to symmetries of the system.

A simple reconstruction method to infer nonreciprocal interactions and   local driving in complex systems,"Tim Hempel, Sarah A. M. Loos","Data-based inference of directed interactions in complex dynamical systems is a problem common to many disciplines of science. In this work, we study networks of spatially separate dynamical entities, which could represent physical systems that interact with each other by reciprocal or nonreciprocal, instantaneous or time-delayed interactions. We present a simple approach that combines Markov state models with directed information-theoretical measures for causal inference that can accurately infer the underlying interactions from noisy time series of the dynamical system states alone. Remarkably, this is possible despite the built-in simplification of a Markov assumption and the choice of a very coarse discretization at the level of probability estimation. Our test systems are an Ising chain with nonreciprocal coupling imposed by local driving of a single spin, and a system of delay-coupled linear stochastic processes. Stepping away from physical systems, the approach infers cause-effect relationships, or more generally, the direction of mutual or one-way influence. The presented method is agnostic to the number of interacting entities and details of the dynamics, so that it is widely applicable to problems in various fields.",2024-03-14T10:06:11Z,2024-03-14T10:06:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09243v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09243v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.comp-ph"

This provides the first order-optimal barely random algorithms for metrical task systems, i.e., which use a number of random bits that does not depend on the number of requests addressed to the system. We discuss implications on various aspects of online decision-making such as: distributed systems, advice complexity, and transaction costs, suggesting broad applicability. We put forward an equivalent view that we call collective metrical task systems where $k$ agents in a metrical task system team up, and suffer the average cost paid by each agent.

Which approach can be adopted for different dynamic structure systems categories is a topic of interest for many researchers and until now has not been fully resolved. Therefore it is essential to explore the existing approaches, understand them, and identify gaps. To fulfil this goal, we identified criteria at stake for a smooth flow from model creation to its simulation for dynamic structure systems.

Cybersecurity starts with risk, and there are good taxonomies for security vulnerabilities and impacts in classical systems. In this paper, we propose a preliminary taxonomy for quantum cybersecurity vulnerabilities that accounts for the latest advances in quantum information systems, and must evolve to incorporate well-established cybersecurity principles and methodologies. We envision a testbed environment designed and instrumented with the specific purpose of enabling a broad collaborative community of cybersecurity and quantum information system experts to conduct experimental evaluation of software and hardware security including both physical and virtual quantum components.

We also presented several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems might describe ordinal Turing computations. In the current article, we study in more depth solvable systems, using tools from descriptive set theory. By establishing a correspondence with the class of well-founded trees, we construct a coanalytic ranking over the set of solvable functions and discuss its relation with other existing rankings for differentiable functions, in particular with the Kechris-Woodin, Denjoy and Zalcwasser ranking.

A Behavioral Theory for Distributed Systems with Weak Recovery,"Giovanni Fabbretti, Ivan Lanese, Jean-Bernard Stefani","Distributed systems can be subject to various kinds of partial failures, therefore building fault-tolerance or failure mitigation mechanisms for distributed systems remains an important domain of research. In this paper, we present a calculus to formally model distributed systems subject to crash failures with recovery. The recovery model considered in the paper is weak, in the sense that it makes no assumption on the exact state in which a failed node resumes its execution, only its identity has to be distinguishable from past incarnations of itself. Our calculus is inspired in part by the Erlang programming language and in part by the distributed $\pi$-calculus with nodes and link failures (D$\pi$F) introduced by Francalanza and Hennessy. In order to reason about distributed systems with failures and recovery we develop a behavioral theory for our calculus, in the form of a contextual equivalence, and of a fully abstract coinductive characterization of this equivalence by means of a labelled transition system semantics and its associated weak bisimilarity. This result is valuable for it provides a compositional proof technique for proving or disproving contextual equivalence between systems.",2024-06-18T13:02:39Z,2024-12-24T09:52:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12574v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12574v3,cs.LO
The strength of the dominance rule,"Leszek Aleksander Kołodziejczyk, Neil Thapen","It has become standard that, when a SAT solver decides that a CNF $\Gamma$ is unsatisfiable, it produces a certificate of unsatisfiability in the form of a refutation of $\Gamma$ in some proof system. The system typically used is DRAT, which is equivalent to extended resolution (ER) -- for example, until this year DRAT refutations were required in the annual SAT competition. Recently [Bogaerts et al.~2023] introduced a new proof system, associated with the tool VeriPB, which is at least as strong as DRAT and is further able to handle certain symmetry-breaking techniques. We show that this system simulates the proof system $G_1$, which allows limited reasoning with QBFs and forms the first level above ER in a natural hierarchy of proof systems. This hierarchy is not known to be strict, but nevertheless this is evidence that the system of [Bogaerts et al. 2023] is plausibly strictly stronger than ER and DRAT. In the other direction, we show that symmetry-breaking for a single symmetry can be handled inside ER.",2024-06-19T15:59:28Z,2024-06-19T15:59:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13657v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13657v1,"cs.LO, math.LO"
Prediction of Unobserved Bifurcation by Unsupervised Extraction of   Slowly Time-Varying System Parameter Dynamics from Time Series Using   Reservoir Computing,"Keita Tokuda, Yuichi Katori","Nonlinear and non-stationary processes are prevalent in various natural and physical phenomena, where system dynamics can change qualitatively due to bifurcation phenomena. Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data.

This report outlines a comprehensive approach undertaken by the Information and Decision Science (IDS) Lab, focusing on integrating data-driven techniques with control strategies to enhance CPS performance, particularly in the context of energy efficiency and environmental impact. CPS are intricate networks where physical and software components are deeply intertwined, operating as systems of systems. These systems are characterized by their informationally decentralized nature, posing significant challenges in optimization and control. Classical control methods depend heavily on precise models, which often do not capture the full complexity of real-world CPS.

Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series.

Global stability of first order endotactic reaction systems,Chuang Xu,"Reaction networks are a general framework widely used in modelling diverse phenomena in different science disciplines. The dynamical process of a reaction network endowed with mass-action kinetics is a mass-action system. In this paper we study dynamics of first order mass-action systems. We prove that every first order endotactic mass-action system has a weakly reversible deficiency zero realization, and has a unique equilibrium which is exponentially globally asymptotically stable (and is positive) in each (positive) stoichiometric compatibility class. In particular, we prove that global attractivity conjecture holds for every linear complex balanced mass-action system. In this way, we exclude the possibility of first order endotactic mass-action systems to admit multistationarity or multistability. The result indicates that the importance of binding molecules in reactants is crucial for (endotactic) reaction networks to have complicated dynamics like limit cycles. The proof relies on the fact that $\mathcal{A}$-endotacticity of first order reaction networks implies endotacticity for a finite set $\mathcal{A}$, which is also proved in this paper.   Out of independent interest, we provide a sufficient condition for endotacticity of reaction networks which are not necessarily of first order.",2024-09-03T04:41:14Z,2024-09-03T04:41:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01598v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01598v1,"math.DS, 37N25, 92C42"
Optimised Hybrid Classical-Quantum Algorithm for Accelerated Solution of   Sparse Linear Systems,Hakikat Singh,"Efficiently solving large-scale sparse linear systems poses a significant challenge in computational science, especially in fields such as physics, engineering, machine learning, and finance. Traditional classical algorithms face scalability issues as the size of these systems increases, leading to performance degradation. On the other hand, quantum algorithms, like the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, offer exponential speedups for solving linear systems, yet they are constrained by the current state of quantum hardware and sensitivity to matrix condition numbers. This paper introduces a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm that combines CUDA-accelerated preconditioning techniques with the HHL algorithm to solve sparse linear systems more efficiently. The classical GPU parallelism is utilised to preprocess and precondition the matrix, reducing its condition number, while quantum computing is employed to solve the preconditioned system using the HHL algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm integrates machine learning models, particularly reinforcement learning, to dynamically optimise system parameters, such as block sizes and preconditioning stratgies, based on real-time performance data.

The assumptions of the theorem can be verified with computer assistance. Moreover, the theory is general in a way that it can be applied to any dynamical system in infinite dimensions, provided the system is close to a one-dimensional map in a certain sense.

To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of hybridised bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.",2024-12-18T15:33:32Z,2025-01-23T09:56:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13954v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13954v2,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, math-ph, math.MP, 35J05, 35C20, 35P20"
"Knowledge in multi-robot systems: an interplay of dynamics, computation   and communication","Giorgio Cignarale, Stephan Felber, Eric Goubault, Bernardo Hummes Flores, Hugo Rincon Galeana","We show that the hybrid systems perspective of distributed multi-robot systems is compatible with logical models of knowledge already used in distributed computing, and demonstrate its usefulness by deriving sufficient epistemic conditions for exploration and gathering robot tasks to be solvable. We provide a separation of the physical and computational aspects of a robotic system, allowing us to decouple the problems related to each and directly use methods from control theory and distributed computing, fields that are traditionally distant in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate a novel approach for reasoning about the knowledge in multi-robot systems through a principled method of converting a switched hybrid dynamical system into a temporal-epistemic logic model, passing through an abstract state machine representation. This creates space for methods and results to be exchanged across the fields of control theory, distributed computing and temporal-epistemic logic, while reasoning about multi-robot systems.",2025-01-30T12:36:36Z,2025-01-30T12:36:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18309v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18309v1,"cs.LO, cs.DC, cs.RO"
Low temperature thermal expansion of pure and inert gas-doped Fullerite   C60,"A. N. Aleksandrovskii, A. S Bakai, A. V. Dolbin, V. B. Esel'son, G. E. Gadd, V. G. Gavrilko, V. G. Manzhelii, S.

Udovidchenko","The low temperature (2-24 K) thermal expansion of pure (single crystal and polycrystalline) C60 and polycrystalline C60 intercalated with He, Ne, Ar, and Kr has been investigated using high-resolution capacitance dilatometer. The investigation of the time dependence of the sample length variations on heating shows that the thermal expansion is determined by the sum of positive and negative contributions, which have different relaxation times. The negative thermal expansion usually prevails at helium temperatures. The positive expansion is connected with the phonon thermalization of the system. The negative expansion is caused by reorientation of the C60 molecules. It is assumed that the reorientation is of quantum character. The inert gas impurities affect very strongly the reorientation of the C60 molecules especially at liquid helium temperatures. A temperature hysteresis of the thermal expansion coefficient of Kr- and He- C60 solutions has been revealed. The hysteresis is attributed to orientational polyamorphous transformation in these systems.",2002-12-24T06:31:16Z,2002-12-24T06:31:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0212578v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0212578v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.dis-nn"
Are there Hilbert-style Pure Type Systems?,"M. W. Bunder, W. M. J. Dekkers","For many a natural deduction style logic there is a Hilbert-style logic that is equivalent to it in that it has the same theorems (i.e. valid judgements with empty contexts). For intuitionistic logic, the axioms of the equivalent Hilbert-style logic can be propositions which are also known as the types of the combinators I, K and S. Hilbert-style versions of illative combinatory logic have formulations with axioms that are actual type statements for I, K and S. As pure type systems (PTSs)are, in a sense, equivalent to systems of illative combinatory logic, it might be thought that Hilbert-style PTSs (HPTSs) could be based in a similar way. This paper shows that some PTSs have very trivial equivalent HPTSs, with only the axioms as theorems and that for many PTSs no equivalent HPTS can exist. Most commonly used PTSs belong to these two classes. For some PTSs however, including lambda* and the PTS at the basis of the proof assistant Coq, there is a nontrivial equivalent HPTS, with axioms that are type statements for I, K and S.",2007-07-06T00:22:59Z,2008-01-07T09:36:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0890v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.0890v2,"cs.LO, F.4.1"
"RPO, Second-order Contexts, and Lambda-calculus","Pietro Di Gianantonio, Furio Honsell, Marina Lenisa","First, we extend Leifer-Milner RPO theory, by giving general conditions to obtain IPO labelled transition systems (and bisimilarities) with a reduced set of transitions, and possibly finitely branching. Moreover, we study the weak variant of Leifer-Milner theory, by giving general conditions under which the weak bisimilarity is a congruence. Then, we apply such extended RPO technique to the lambda-calculus, endowed with lazy and call by value reduction strategies.   We show that, contrary to process calculi, one can deal directly with the lambda-calculus syntax and apply Leifer-Milner technique to a category of contexts, provided that we work in the framework of weak bisimilarities.   However, even in the case of the transition system with minimal contexts, the resulting bisimilarity is infinitely branching, due to the fact that, in standard context categories, parametric rules such as the beta-rule can be represented only by infinitely many ground rules.   To overcome this problem, we introduce the general notion of second-order context category. We show that, by carrying out the RPO construction in this setting, the lazy observational equivalence can be captured as a weak bisimilarity equivalence on a finitely branching transition system. This result is achieved by considering an encoding of lambda-calculus in Combinatory Logic.",2009-06-15T15:44:56Z,2009-08-06T08:18:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2727v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.2727v2,"cs.PL, cs.LO, F.3.2; F.4.1"
Spectral energy distributions and age estimates of 104 M31 globular   clusters,"Song Wang, Zhou Fan, Jun Ma, Richard de Grijs, Xu Zhou","We present photometry of 104 M31 globular clusters (GCs) and GC candidates in 15 intermediate-band filters of the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) photometric system.

The photometric data used are {\sl GALEX} far- and near-ultraviolet and 2MASS near-infrared $JHK_{\rm s}$ magnitudes, combined with optical photometry. The ages of our sample clusters cover a large range, although most clusters are younger than 10 Gyr. Combined with the ages obtained in our series of previous papers focusing on the M31 GC system, we present the full M31 GC age distribution. The M31 GC system contains populations of young and intermediate-age GCs, as well as the `usual' complement of well-known old GCs, i.e., GCs of similar age as the majority of the Galactic GCs.

The SPIRE Photometer Interactive Analysis Package SPIA,Bernhard Schulz,"The Herschel Common Science System (HCSS) (Ott et al. 2006) (Ott & Science Ground Segment Consortium 2010) is a substantial Java software package, accompanying the development of the Herschel Mission (Pilbratt et al. 2010), supporting all of its phases. In particular the reduction of data from the scientific instruments for instrument checkout, calibration, and astronomical analysis is one of its major applications. The data reduction software is split up in modules, called ""tasks"". Agreed-upon sequences of tasks form pipelines that deliver well defined standard products for storage in a web-accessible Herschel Science Archive (HSA) (Leon et al. 2009). However, as astronomers and instrument scientists continue to characterize instrumental effects, astronomers already need to publish scientific results and may not have the time to acquire a sufficiently deep understanding of the system to apply necessary fixes. There is a need for intermediate level analysis tools that offer more flexibility than rigid pipelines. The task framework within the HCSS and the highly versatile Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE), together with the rich set of libraries provide the necessary tools to develop GUI-based interactive analysis packages for the Herschel instruments. The SPIRE Photometer Interactive Analysis (SPIA) package, that was demonstrated in this session, proves the validity of the concept for the SPIRE instrument (Griffin et al. 2010), breaking up the pipeline reduction into logical components, making all relevant processing parameters available in GUIs, and providing a more controlled and user-friendly access to the complexities of the system.",2011-01-06T20:10:48Z,2011-01-06T20:10:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1284v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.1284v1,astro-ph.IM
Oscillators and relaxation phenomena in Pleistocene climate theory,Michel Crucifix,"Ice sheets appeared in the northern hemisphere around 3 million years ago and glacial-interglacial cycles have paced Earth's climate since then. Superimposed on these long glacial cycles comes an intricate pattern of millennial and sub-millennial variability, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events. There are numerous theories about theses oscillations. Here, we review a number of them in order to draw a parallel between climatic concepts and dynamical system concepts, including, in particular, the relaxation oscillator, excitability, slow-fast dynamics and homoclinic orbits. Namely, almost all theories of ice ages reviewed here feature a phenomenon of synchronisation between internal climate dynamics and the astronomical forcing. However, these theories differ in their bifurcation structure and this has an effect on the way the ice age phenomenon could grow 3 million years ago. All theories on rapid events reviewed here rely on the concept of a limit cycle in the ocean circulation, which may be excited by changes in the surface freshwater surface balance. The article also reviews basic effects of stochastic fluctuations on these models, including the phenomenon of phase dispersion, shortening of the limit cycle and stochastic resonance. It concludes with a more personal statement about the potential for inference with simple stochastic dynamical systems in palaeoclimate science.

Furthermore we propose a quick process to optimize the system to provide the maximum solar energy to net heat efficiency for different optical error under typical condition.

Knowledge epidemics and population dynamics models for describing idea   diffusion,"Nikolay K. Vitanov, Marcel R. Ausloos","The diffusion of ideas is often closely connected to the creation and diffusion of knowledge and to the technological evolution of society. Because of this, knowledge creation, exchange and its subsequent transformation into innovations for improved welfare and economic growth is briefly described from a historical point of view. Next, three approaches are discussed for modeling the diffusion of ideas in the areas of science and technology, through (i) deterministic, (ii) stochastic, and (iii) statistical approaches. These are illustrated through their corresponding population dynamics and epidemic models relative to the spreading of ideas, knowledge and innovations. The deterministic dynamical models are considered to be appropriate for analyzing the evolution of large and small societal, scientific and technological systems when the influence of fluctuations is insignificant. Stochastic models are appropriate when the system of interest is small but when the fluctuations become significant for its evolution. Finally statistical approaches and models based on the laws and distributions of Lotka, Bradford, Yule, Zipf-Mandelbrot, and others, provide much useful information for the analysis of the evolution of systems in which development is closely connected to the process of idea diffusion.",2012-01-03T15:52:01Z,2012-01-03T15:52:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0676v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0676v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI"
Derivation Lengths Classification of Gödel's T Extending Howard's   Assignment,"Gunnar Wilken, Andreas Weiermann",Let T be Goedel's system of primitive recursive functionals of finite type in the lambda formulation. We define by constructive means using recursion on nested multisets a multivalued function I from the set of terms of T into the set of natural numbers such that if a term a reduces to a term b and if a natural number I(a) is assigned to a then a natural number I(b) can be assigned to b such that I(a) is greater than I(b). The construction of I is based on Howard's 1970 ordinal assignment for T and Weiermann's 1996 treatment of T in the combinatory logic version. As a corollary we obtain an optimal derivation length classification for the lambda formulation of T and its fragments. Compared with Weiermann's 1996 exposition this article yields solutions to several non-trivial problems arising from dealing with lambda terms instead of combinatory logic terms. It is expected that the methods developed here can be applied to other higher order rewrite systems resulting in new powerful termination orderings since T is a paradigm for such systems.,2012-03-01T08:21:26Z,2012-03-03T12:49:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0115v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0115v2,"cs.LO, math.LO, F.4.1; F.1.3"

In addition, the lunar surface offers outstanding opportunities for research in astronomy, astrobiology, fundamental physics, life sciences and human physiology and medicine. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of outstanding lunar science objectives in all of these different areas. It is concluded that addressing them satisfactorily will require an end to the 40-year hiatus of lunar surface exploration, and the placing of new scientific instruments on, and the return of additional samples from, the surface of the Moon. Some of these objectives can be achieved robotically (e.g. through targeted sample return, the deployment of geophysical networks, and the placing of antennas on the lunar surface to form radio telescopes). However, in the longer term, most of these scientific objectives would benefit significantly from renewed human operations on the lunar surface. For these reasons it is highly desirable that current plans for renewed robotic surface exploration of the Moon are developed in the context of a future human lunar exploration programme, such as that proposed by the recently formulated Global Exploration Roadmap.",2012-06-04T20:04:47Z,2012-06-04T20:04:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0749v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.0749v1,"astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM"
Graywulf: A platform for federated scientific databases and services,"László Dobos, Alexander S. Szalay, Tamás Budavári, István Csabai, Nolan Li","Many fields of science rely on relational database management systems to analyze, publish and share data. Since RDBMS are originally designed for, and their development directions are primarily driven by, business use cases they often lack features very important for scientific applications. Horizontal scalability is probably the most important missing feature which makes it challenging to adapt traditional relational database systems to the ever growing data sizes. Due to the limited support of array data types and metadata management, successful application of RDBMS in science usually requires the development of custom extensions. While some of these extensions are specific to the field of science, the majority of them could easily be generalized and reused in other disciplines. With the Graywulf project we intend to target several goals. We are building a generic platform that offers reusable components for efficient storage, transformation, statistical analysis and presentation of scientific data stored in Microsoft SQL Server. Graywulf also addresses the distributed computational issues arising from current RDBMS technologies. The current version supports load balancing of simple queries and parallel execution of partitioned queries over a set of mirrored databases. Uniform user access to the data is provided through a web based query interface and a data surface for software clients. Queries are formulated in a slightly modified syntax of SQL that offers a transparent view of the distributed data. The software library consists of several components that can be reused to develop complex scientific data warehouses: a system registry, administration tools to manage entire database server clusters, a sophisticated workflow execution framework, and a SQL parser library.",2013-08-06T23:02:12Z,2013-08-06T23:02:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1440v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1440v1,cs.DB

Developing a High Performance Software Library with MPI and CUDA for   Matrix Computations,"Bogdan Oancea, Tudorel Andrei","Nowadays, the paradigm of parallel computing is changing. CUDA is now a popular programming model for general purpose computations on GPUs and a great number of applications were ported to CUDA obtaining speedups of orders of magnitude comparing to optimized CPU implementations. Hybrid approaches that combine the message passing model with the shared memory model for parallel computing are a solution for very large applications. We considered a heterogeneous cluster that combines the CPU and GPU computations using MPI and CUDA for developing a high performance linear algebra library. Our library deals with large linear systems solvers because they are a common problem in the fields of science and engineering. Direct methods for computing the solution of such systems can be very expensive due to high memory requirements and computational cost. An efficient alternative are iterative methods which computes only an approximation of the solution.

Our work extends the framework of [BFRR14] and follow-up papers, which focused on quantitative objectives, by addressing the case of $\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, a natural way to represent functional requirements of systems.   We build strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while ensuring a secondary one with sufficient probability. This setting raises new challenges in comparison to quantitative objectives, as one cannot easily mix different strategies without endangering the functional properties of the system. We establish that, for all variants of this problem, deciding the existence of a strategy lies in ${\sf NP} \cap {\sf coNP}$, the same complexity class as classical parity games.

Intuitionistic Layered Graph Logic: Semantics and Proof Theory,"Simon Docherty, David Pym","Models of complex systems are widely used in the physical and social sciences, and the concept of layering, typically building upon graph-theoretic structure, is a common feature. We describe an intuitionistic substructural logic called ILGL that gives an account of layering. The logic is a bunched system, combining the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a non-commutative, non-associative conjunction (used to capture layering) and its associated implications. We give soundness and completeness theorems for a labelled tableaux system with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. We then give an equivalent relational semantics, itself proven equivalent to an algebraic semantics via a representation theorem. We utilise this result in two ways. First, we prove decidability of the logic by showing the finite embeddability property holds for the algebraic semantics. Second, we prove a Stone-type duality theorem for the logic. By introducing the notions of ILGL hyperdoctrine and indexed layered frame we are able to extend this result to a predicate version of the logic and prove soundness and completeness theorems for an extension of the layered graph semantics .

As a result, it was determined that a set of 219 publications show a high bibliometric interrelation among its articles and these are presented transversely between the social sciences, computer science and health.

In this paper, we address this generality problem by presenting a transfer learning-based approach for microstructure reconstruction and structure-property predictions that is applicable to a wide range of material systems. The proposed approach incorporates an encoder-decoder process and feature-matching optimization using a deep convolutional network. For microstructure reconstruction, model pruning is implemented in order to study the correlation between the microstructural features and hierarchical layers within the deep convolutional network. Knowledge obtained in model pruning is then leveraged in the development of a structure-property predictive model to determine the network architecture and initialization conditions. The generality of the approach is demonstrated numerically for a wide range of material microstructures with geometrical characteristics of varying complexity.

A Decision Support System for Multi-target Geosteering,"Sergey Alyaev, Erich Suter, Reidar Bratvold, Aojie Hong, Xiaodong Luo","Geosteering is a sequential decision process under uncertainty. The goal of geosteering is to maximize the expected value of the well, which should be defined by an objective value-function for each operation.   In this paper we present a real-time decision support system (DSS) for geosteering that aims to approximate the uncertainty in the geological interpretation with an ensemble of geomodel realizations. As the drilling operation progresses, the ensemble Kalman filter is used to sequentially update the realizations using the measurements from real-time logging while drilling. At every decision point a discrete dynamic programming algorithm computes all potential well trajectories for the entire drilling operation and the corresponding value of the well for each realization. Then, the DSS considers all immediate alternatives (continue/steer/stop) and chooses the one that gives the best predicted value across the realizations. This approach works for a variety of objectives and constraints and suggests reproducible decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it has real-time performance.   The system is tested on synthetic cases in a layer-cake geological environment where the target layer should be selected dynamically based on the prior (pre-drill) model and the electromagnetic observations received while drilling. The numerical closed-loop simulation experiments demonstrate the ability of the DSS to perform successful geosteering and landing of a well for different geological configurations of drilling targets. Furthermore, the DSS allows to adjust and reweight the objectives, making the DSS useful before fully automated geosteering becomes reality.",2019-03-10T06:07:31Z,2019-09-20T09:22:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03933v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03933v2,"cs.CE, stat.AP"
Nonmodular architectures of cognitive systems based on active inference,"Manuel Baltieri, Christopher L. Buckley","In psychology and neuroscience it is common to describe cognitive systems as input/output devices where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a purely feedforward, open-loop fashion. On this view, perception and action are often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction between them. While embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the more recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still heavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions. Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we present a minimal model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture based on the separation principle. We link this to popular formulations of perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its limitations when, for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation from the environment or an interference caused by other agents. As an alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive science, we then propose a nonmodular architecture based on the active inference framework. We demonstrate the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that the mechanism with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to integral control.",2019-03-22T15:00:25Z,2019-03-22T15:00:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09542v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09542v1,"q-bio.NC, cs.AI"
Venus: Key to understanding the evolution of terrestrial planets,"Colin Frank Wilson, Thomas Widemann","As we become aware of Earth's changing climate, and as we discover terrestrial planets in other solar systems, we gain ever more reasons to study the Earth's nearest neighbour and closest sibling, the only Earth-sized planet besides our own that can be reached by our spacecraft. For the scientific and programmatic reasons outlined in this document, Venus is a compelling target for exploration. The science themes important for Venus research - comparative planetology and planetary evolution - are common to all of planetary and exoplanetary science. Many of the payloads required - radar and atmospheric remote sensing, in situ mass spectrometers - are common to mission proposals for many other solar system targets, as are mission technologies like high rate deep-space telecommunications technologies. Venus-specific technology developments meriting special attention include high-temperature systems and balloons. Venus is an excellent proving ground for fundamental understanding of geophysical processes of terrestrial planets; an excellent proving ground for techniques of analysis of exoplanets; an indispensable part of our quest to understand the evolution of Earthlike planets. For all these reasons, Venus will be an ever more compelling theme in the coming decades, and we therefore recommend its inclusion in the Voyage 2050 plan. We recommend that ESA aim to have launched at least two M-class Venus missions by 2050, including the EnVision M5 geophysics orbiter, and an in situ element such as a cloud-level balloon; or an L-class mission combining these elements.",2019-08-07T13:48:13Z,2019-08-07T13:48:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04269v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04269v1,"astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM"

Free utility model for explaining the social gravity law,"Hao Wang, Xiao-Yong Yan, Jinshan Wu","Social gravity law widely exists in human travel, population migration, commodity trade, information communication, scientific collaboration and so on. Why is there such a simple law in many complex social systems is an interesting question. Although scientists from fields of statistical physics, complex systems, economics and transportation science have explained the social gravity law, a theoretical explanation including two dominant mechanisms, namely individual interaction and bounded rationality, is still lacking. Here we present a free utility model, whose objective function is mathematically consistent with the Helmholtz free energy in physics, from the perspective of individual choice behavior to explain the social gravity law. The basic assumption is that bounded rational individuals interacting with each other will trade off the expected utility and information-processing cost to maximize their own utility. The previous explanations of the social gravity law including the maximum entropy model, the free cost model, the Logit model and the destination choice game model are all special cases under our model. Further, we extend the free utility model to the network. This model not only helps us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of spatial interaction patterns in complex social systems, but also provides a new perspective for understanding the potential function in game theory and the user equilibrium model in transportation science.",2020-09-17T00:28:46Z,2021-02-18T08:55:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07984v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07984v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.GT"

We provide new ROS packages for Conda, enabling the installation of ROS alongside data-science and machine-learning packages with ease. Multiple ROS versions (currently ROS1 Melodic and Noetic, as well as ROS2 Foxy and Galactic) can run simultaneously on one machine, with pre-compiled binaries available for Linux, Windows and OSX, and the ARM architecture (e.g. the Raspberry Pi and the new Apple Silicon).

Analysis of Large Scale Propagation Models for Mobile Communications in   Urban Area,"M. A. Alim, M. M. Rahman, M. M. Hossain, A. Al Nahid","Channel properties influence the development of wireless communication systems. Unlike wired channels that are stationary and predictable, radio channels are extremely random and dont offer easy analysis. A Radio Propagation Model (RPM), also known as the Radio Wave Propagation Model (RWPM), is an empirical mathematical formulation for the characterization of radio wave propagation as a function of frequency. In mobile radio systems, path loss models are necessary for proper planning, interference estimations, frequency assignments and cell parameters which are the basic for network planning process as well as Location Based Services (LBS) techniques. Propagation models that predict the mean signal strength for an arbitrary transmitter receiver (T R) separation distance which is useful in estimating the radio coverage area of a transmitter are called large scale propagation models, since they characterize signal strength over large TR separation distances. In this paper, the large scale propagation performance of Okumura, Hata, and Lee models has been compared varying Mobile Station (MS) antenna height, Transmitter Receiver (TR) distance and Base Station (BS) antenna height, considering the system to operate at 900 MHz.

Proposal of a new quantum annealing schedule for studying quantum   annealing of transverse field Ising models,Chiaki Yamaguchi,"Recently, Heim, Ronnow, Isakov and Troyer [Science 348 (2015) 215] have reported that Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising spin glass model on the square lattice in the physically relevant continuous-imaginary-time limit do not show superiority of quantum annealing (QA) using transverse field against classical annealing (CA). Although the QA schedule that they had used has been using conventionally, however the QA schedule mathematically has no guarantee that the used schedule is the best QA schedule for performance of optimization. We propose a new QA schedule for studying transverse-field-based quantum versus classical annealing of the Ising model. The present QA schedule utilizes a smallest effective transverse field derived in this article. This QA schedule is made for the comparison between the system with no transverse field and the system with the smallest effective transverse field. As a case study, we study QA of the Ising spin glass model on the square lattice at low but finite temperature. A Monte Carlo algorithm using the physically relevant continuous-imaginary-time limit is performed. As the simulation results, we show superiority of QA against CA when the annealing time is sufficiently spent.",2017-06-20T13:31:21Z,2019-06-08T18:57:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06416v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06416v4,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph"

Finding evidence for life on rocky planets outside of our solar system requires new technical capabilities for the key measurements of spectral signatures of biosignature gases, and of planetary mass measurement. Spectra of Earth-like planets can be directly measured in reflected stellar light in the visible band or near-infrared using a factor 1e-10 starlight suppression with occulters, either internal (coronagraph) or external (starshade). Absorption and emission (reflected and thermal) spectra can be obtained in the mid-infrared of rocky planets transiting M-dwarfs via spectroscopy of the transit and secondary eclipse, respectively. Mass can be measured from the star's reflex motion, the reflex motion of a star, via either precision radial velocity methods or astrometry. Several technology gaps must be closed to provide astronomers the necessary capabilities to obtain these key measurements for small planets orbiting within the predicted temperate zones around nearby stars. These involved performance improvements, in some cases, 1-2 orders of magnitude from state-of-the-art or involve performances never demonstrated.

Comparison of Two Theorem Provers: Isabelle/HOL and Coq,Artem Yushkovskiy,"The need for formal definition of the very basis of mathematics arose in the last century. The scale and complexity of mathematics, along with discovered paradoxes, revealed the danger of accumulating errors across theories. Although, according to G\""odel's incompleteness theorems, it is not possible to construct a single formal system which will describe all phenomena in the world, being complete and consistent at the same time, it gave rise to rather practical areas of logic, such as the theory of automated theorem proving. This is a set of techniques used to verify mathematical statements mechanically using logical reasoning. Moreover, it can be used to solve complex engineering problems as well, for instance, to prove the security properties of a software system or an algorithm. This paper compares two widespread tools for automated theorem proving, Isabelle/HOL and Coq, with respect to expressiveness, limitations and usability. For this reason, it firstly gives a brief introduction to the bases of formal systems and automated deduction theory, their main problems and challenges, and then provides detailed comparison of most notable features of the selected theorem provers with support of illustrative proof examples.",2018-08-29T09:33:58Z,2018-09-06T22:05:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09701v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09701v2,cs.LO
GF + MMT = GLF -- From Language to Semantics through LF,"Michael Kohlhase, Jan Frederik Schaefer","These days, vast amounts of knowledge are available online, most of it in written form. Search engines help us access this knowledge, but aggregating, relating and reasoning with it is still a predominantly human effort. One of the key challenges for automated reasoning based on natural-language texts is the need to extract meaning (semantics) from texts. Natural language understanding (NLU) systems describe the conversion from a set of natural language utterances to terms in a particular logic. Tools for the co-development of grammar and target logic are currently largely missing.   We will describe the Grammatical Logical Framework (GLF), a combination of two existing frameworks, in which large parts of a symbolic, rule-based NLU system can be developed and implemented: the Grammatical Framework (GF) and MMT. GF is a tool for syntactic analysis, generation, and translation with complex natural language grammars and MMT can be used to specify logical systems and to represent knowledge in them. Combining these tools is possible, because they are based on compatible logical frameworks: Martin-L\""of type theory and LF. The flexibility of logical frameworks is needed, as NLU research has not settled on a particular target logic for meaning representation. Instead, new logics are developed all the time to handle various language phenomena. GLF allows users to develop the logic and the language parsing components in parallel, and to connect them for experimentation with the entire pipeline.",2019-10-24T00:22:43Z,2019-10-24T00:22:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10849v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10849v1,"cs.CL, cs.LO"
Cybercosm: New Foundations for a Converged Science Data Ecosystem,"Mark Asch, François Bodin, Micah Beck, Terry Moore, Michela Taufer, Martin Swany, Jean-Pierre Vilotte","Scientific communities naturally tend to organize around data ecosystems created by the combination of their observational devices, their data repositories, and the workflows essential to carry their research from observation to discovery. However, these legacy data ecosystems are now breaking down under the pressure of the exponential growth in the volume and velocity of these workflows, which are further complicated by the need to integrate the highly data intensive methods of the Artificial Intelligence revolution. Enabling ground breaking science that makes full use of this new, data saturated research environment will require distributed systems that support dramatically improved resource sharing, workflow portability and composability, and data ecosystem convergence.   The Cybercosm vision presented in this white paper describes a radically different approach to the architecture of distributed systems for data-intensive science and its application workflows. As opposed to traditional models that restrict interoperability by hiving off storage, networking, and computing resources in separate technology silos, Cybercosm defines a minimally sufficient hypervisor as a spanning layer for its data plane that virtualizes and converges the local resources of the system's nodes in a fully interoperable manner.

Active learning, the machine learning field of optimal experiment design, selects each subsequent experiment to maximize knowledge toward the user goal. Autonomous system performance can be further improved with implementation of scientific machine learning, also known as inductive bias-engineered artificial intelligence, which folds prior knowledge of physical laws (e.g., Gibbs phase rule) into the algorithm. As the number, diversity, and uses for active learning strategies grow, there is an associated growing necessity for real-world reference datasets to benchmark strategies. We present a reference dataset and demonstrate its use to benchmark active learning strategies in the form of various acquisition functions. Active learning strategies are used to rapidly identify materials with optimal physical properties within a ternary materials system. The data is from an actual Fe-Co-Ni thin-film library and includes previously acquired experimental data for materials compositions, X-ray diffraction patterns, and two functional properties of magnetic coercivity and the Kerr rotation.

Routley Star in Information-Based Semantics,"Vít Punčochář, Igor Sedlár","It is common in various non-classical logics, especially in relevant logics, to characterize negation semantically via the operation known as Routley star. This operation works well within relational semantic frameworks based on prime theories. We study this operation in the context of ""information-based"" semantics for which it is characteristic that sets of formulas supported by individual information states are theories that do not have to be prime. We will show that, somewhat surprisingly, the incorporation of Routley star into the information-based semantics does not lead to a collapse or a trivialization of the whole semantic system. On the contrary, it leads to a technically elegant though quite restricted semantic framework that determines a particular logic. We study some basic properties of this semantics. For example, we show that within this framework double negation law is valid only in involutive linear frames. We characterize axiomatically the logic of all linear frames and show that the logic of involutive linear frames coincides with a system that Mike Dunn coined Kalman logic. This logic is the fragment (for the language restricted to conjunction, disjunction and negation) of the ""semi-relevant"" logic known as R-mingle. Finally, we characterize by a deductive system the logic of all information frames equipped with Routley star.",2022-04-14T03:29:07Z,2022-04-14T03:29:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06738v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06738v1,cs.LO
Operational Metric for Quantum Chaos and the Corresponding   Spatiotemporal Entanglement Structure,"Neil Dowling, Kavan Modi","Chaotic systems are highly sensitive to a small perturbation, and are ubiquitous throughout biological sciences, physical sciences and even social sciences. Taking this as the underlying principle, we construct an operational notion for quantum chaos. Namely, we demand that the future state of a many-body, isolated quantum system is sensitive to past multitime operations on a small subpart of that system. By `sensitive', we mean that the resultant states from two different perturbations cannot easily be transformed into each other. That is, the pertinent quantity is the complexity of the effect of the perturbation within the final state. From this intuitive metric, which we call the Butterfly Flutter Fidelity, we use the language of multitime quantum processes to identify a series of operational conditions on chaos, in particular the scaling of the spatiotemporal entanglement. Our criteria already contain the routine notions, as well as the well-known diagnostics for quantum chaos. This includes the Peres-Loschmidt Echo, Dynamical Entropy, Tripartite Mutual Information, and Local-Operator Entanglement. We hence present a unified framework for these existing diagnostics within a single structure. We also go on to quantify how several mechanisms lead to quantum chaos, such as evolution generated from random circuits.

Designing Equilibria in Concurrent Games with Social Welfare and   Temporal Logic Constraints,"Julian Gutierrez, Muhammad Najib, Giuseppe Perelli, Michael Wooldridge","In game theory, mechanism design is concerned with the design of incentives so that a desired outcome of the game can be achieved. In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.",2023-06-05T17:15:26Z,2024-12-03T12:20:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03045v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03045v5,"cs.LO, cs.GT, cs.MA"
Modular Assurance of Complex Systems Using Contract-Based Design   Principles,"Dag McGeorge, Jon Arne Glomsrud","A growing number of safety-critical industries agree that building confidence in complex systems can be achieved through evidence and structured argumentation framed in assurance cases. Nevertheless, according to practical industry experience, assurance cases can easily become too rigorous and difficult to develop and maintain when applied to complex systems. Therefore, we propose to use contract-based development (CBD), a method to manage complexity originally developed in computer science, to simplify assurance cases by modularizing them. This paper will not only summarize relevant previous work such as constructing consistent modular assurance cases using CBD, but more importantly also propose a novel approach to integrate CBD with the argumentation in assurance case modules. This approach will allow subject-matter and domain experts to build assurance case modules together without having to know CBD. This can help a broader application of these methods in industry because subject matter experts outside of computer science can contribute to cross disciplinary co-development of assurance cases without having to learn CBD. Industry experience has proven four rules of thumb helpful for developing high-quality assurance cases. This article illustrates their usefulness and explains how modular assurance enables assurance that accounts for the interdependency of different concerns such as safety, security and performance.",2024-02-20T08:23:06Z,2024-08-08T19:21:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12804v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12804v2,"cs.LO, cs.SE"
A Compact Anomaly Detection Solution for Science Instruments,"Alfonso Lagares de Toledo, Christopher E.

Onboard anomaly detection could allow instruments to recover from such events but its ad hoc development typically falls outside the mission timeline or monetary constraints. Here we describe a compact solution for the implementation of onboard anomaly detection meant for space science missions. The device is designed to be interoperable with a broad range of instruments utilizing easily accessible power and logic signals to monitor the state of peripherals and actuators without disrupting their functionality. By leveraging a commercially available microcontroller with a radiation hardened alternative package the device can be inexpensively sourced and assembled with minimal work enabling instrument characterization on an expedited timeline. The system can then be exchanged for a radiation hardened version ensuring the replicability of observed anomalies in a laboratory environment during instrument operations. We also present currently implemented anomaly detection algorithms which enable the system to detect anomalies in instruments with varying failure modes and allow mission designers to choose which detection approach best fits the specific needs of their instrument.

Van de Walle, Audrius Alkauskas, Lukas Razinkovas","We apply density functional theory to investigate interactions between electronic and vibrational states in crystal defects with multi-mode dynamical Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. Our focus is on transitions between orbital singlet and degenerate orbital doublet characterized by $E \otimes (e \oplus e \oplus \cdots)$ JT coupling, which frequently occurs in crystal defects that are investigated for applications in quantum information science. We utilize a recently developed methodology to model the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the negatively charged split nickel-vacancy center (NiV$^{-}$) in diamond, where JT-active modes significantly influence electron-phonon interactions. Our results validate the effectiveness of the methodology in accurately reproducing the observed 1.4 eV PL lineshape. The strong agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental observations reinforces the identification of the 1.4 eV PL center with the NiV$^{-}$ complex.

Quantifying artificial intelligence through algebraic generalization,"Takuya Ito, Murray Campbell, Lior Horesh, Tim Klinger, Parikshit Ram","The rapid development of modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems has created an urgent need for their scientific quantification. While their fluency across a variety of domains is impressive, modern AI systems fall short on tests requiring symbolic processing and abstraction - a glaring limitation given the necessity for interpretable and reliable technology. Despite a surge of reasoning benchmarks emerging from the academic community, no comprehensive and theoretically-motivated framework exists to quantify reasoning (and more generally, symbolic ability) in AI systems. Here, we adopt a framework from computational complexity theory to explicitly quantify symbolic generalization: algebraic circuit complexity. Many symbolic reasoning problems can be recast as algebraic expressions. Thus, algebraic circuit complexity theory - the study of algebraic expressions as circuit models (i.e., directed acyclic graphs) - is a natural framework to study the complexity of symbolic computation. The tools of algebraic circuit complexity enable the study of generalization by defining benchmarks in terms of their complexity-theoretic properties (i.e., the difficulty of a problem). Moreover, algebraic circuits are generic mathematical objects; for a given algebraic circuit, an arbitrarily large number of samples can be generated for a specific circuit, making it an optimal testbed for the data-hungry machine learning algorithms that are used today. Here, we adopt tools from algebraic circuit complexity theory, apply it to formalize a science of symbolic generalization, and address key theoretical and empirical challenges for its successful application to AI science and its impact on the broader community.",2024-11-08T20:08:18Z,2024-11-08T20:08:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05943v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05943v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.LO"
Customizable LLM-Powered Chatbot for Behavioral Science Research,"Zenon Lamprou, Yashar Moshfeghi","The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence has resulted in the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to produce text that closely resembles human communication. These models have been seamlessly integrated into diverse applications, enabling interactive and responsive communication across multiple platforms. The potential utility of chatbots transcends these traditional applications, particularly in research contexts, wherein they can offer valuable insights and facilitate the design of innovative experiments. In this study, we present a Customizable LLM-Powered Chatbot (CLPC), a web-based chatbot system designed to assist in behavioral science research. The system is meticulously designed to function as an experimental instrument rather than a conventional chatbot, necessitating users to input a username and experiment code upon access. This setup facilitates precise data cross-referencing, thereby augmenting the integrity and applicability of the data collected for research purposes. It can be easily expanded to accommodate new basic events as needed; and it allows researchers to integrate their own logging events without the necessity of implementing a separate logging mechanism. It is worth noting that our system was built to assist primarily behavioral science research but is not limited to it, it can easily be adapted to assist information retrieval research or interacting with chat bot agents in general.",2025-01-09T19:27:28Z,2025-02-02T20:04:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05541v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05541v3,cs.LG
A Focused Sequent Calculus Framework for Proof Search in Pure Type   Systems,"Stéphane Jean Eric Lengrand, Roy Dyckhoff, James McKinna","Basic proof-search tactics in logic and type theory can be seen as the root-first applications of rules in an appropriate sequent calculus, preferably without the redundancies generated by permutation of rules. This paper addresses the issues of defining such sequent calculi for Pure Type Systems (PTS, which were originally presented in natural deduction style) and then organizing their rules for effective proof-search. We introduce the idea of Pure Type Sequent Calculus with meta-variables (PTSCalpha), by enriching the syntax of a permutation-free sequent calculus for propositional logic due to Herbelin, which is strongly related to natural deduction and already well adapted to proof-search. The operational semantics is adapted from Herbelin's and is defined by a system of local rewrite rules as in cut-elimination, using explicit substitutions. We prove confluence for this system. Restricting our attention to PTSC, a type system for the ground terms of this system, we obtain the Subject Reduction property and show that each PTSC is logically equivalent to its corresponding PTS, and the former is strongly normalising iff the latter is. We show how to make the logical rules of PTSC into a syntax-directed system PS for proof-search, by incorporating the conversion rules as in syntax-directed presentations of the PTS rules for type-checking. Finally, we consider how to use the explicitly scoped meta-variables of PTSCalpha to represent partial proof-terms, and use them to analyse interactive proof construction. This sets up a framework PE in which we are able to study proof-search strategies, type inhabitant enumeration and (higher-order) unification.",2010-12-15T16:04:02Z,2011-03-23T08:02:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3372v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3372v2,"cs.LO, F.4.1"

Volatiles are detected through the gas that exocomets release as they collide and grind down within their natal belts, or as they sublimate once scattered inwards to the regions closest to their host star. Most detections are in young, 10 to a few 100 Myr-old systems that are undergoing the final stages of terrestrial planet formation. This opens the exciting possibility to study exocomets at the epoch of volatile delivery to the inner regions of planetary systems. Detection of molecular and atomic gas in exocometary belts allows us to estimate molecular ice abundances and overall elemental abundances, enabling comparison with the Solar Nebula and Solar System comets. At the same time, observing star-grazing exocomets transiting in front of their star (for planetary systems viewed edge-on) and exozodiacal dust in the systems' innermost regions gives unique dynamical insights into the inward scattering process producing delivery to inner rocky planets. The rapid advances of this budding subfield of exoplanetary science will continue in the short term with the upcoming JWST, WFIRST and PLATO missions. In the longer term, the priority should be to explore the full composition of exocomets, including species crucial for delivery and later prebiotic synthesis. Doing so around an increasingly large population of exoplanetary systems is equally important, to enable comparative studies of young exocomets at the epoch of volatile delivery. We identify the proposed LUVOIR and Origins flagship missions as the most promising for a large-scale exploration of exocometary gas, a crucial component of the chemical heritage of young exo-Earths.",2019-04-04T18:00:00Z,2019-04-04T18:00:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02715v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02715v1,"astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.SR"
Antagonistic Phenomena in Network Dynamics,"Adilson E. Motter, Marc Timme","Recent research on the network modeling of complex systems has led to a convenient representation of numerous natural, social, and engineered systems that are now recognized as networks of interacting parts. Such systems can exhibit a wealth of phenomena that not only cannot be anticipated from merely examining their parts, as per the textbook definition of complexity, but also challenge intuition even when considered in the context of what is now known in network science. Here we review the recent literature on two major classes of such phenomena that have far-reaching implications: (i) antagonistic responses to changes of states or parameters and (ii) coexistence of seemingly incongruous behaviors or properties -- both deriving from the collective and inherently decentralized nature of the dynamics. They include effects as diverse as negative compressibility in engineered materials, rescue interactions in biological networks, negative resistance in fluid networks, and the Braess paradox occurring across transport and supply networks. They also include remote synchronization, chimera states and the converse of symmetry breaking in brain, power-grid and oscillator networks as well as remote control in biological and bio-inspired systems. By offering a unified view of these various scenarios, we suggest that they are representative of a yet broader class of unprecedented network phenomena that ought to be revealed and explained by future research.",2018-08-01T04:45:19Z,2020-11-10T19:17:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00165v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00165v2,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.GT, nlin.AO, physics.soc-ph, q-bio.MN"

Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) have emerged as one suitable solution for transforming this flood of data into a simple yet robust data structure. ESDCs achieve this by organising data into an analysis-ready format aligned with a spatio-temporal grid, facilitating user-friendly analysis and diminishing the need for extensive technical data processing knowledge. Despite these significant benefits, the completion of the entire ESDC life cycle remains a challenging task. Obstacles are not only of a technical nature but also relate to domain-specific problems in Earth system research. There exist barriers to realising the full potential of data collections in light of novel cloud-based technologies, particularly in curating data tailored for specific application domains. These include transforming data to conform to a spatio-temporal grid with minimum distortions and managing complexities such as spatio-temporal autocorrelation issues. Addressing these challenges is pivotal for the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches. Furthermore, adhering to open science principles for data dissemination, reproducibility, visualisation, and reuse is crucial for fostering sustainable research. Overcoming these challenges offers a substantial opportunity to advance data-driven Earth system research, unlocking the full potential of an integrated, multidimensional view of Earth system processes.

$E\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller Effect in $C_{70}^{3-}$ Systems,"Lin Tian, Ya-Sha Yi, Chui-Lin Wang, Zhao-Bin Su","The electron-phonon interaction in $C_{70}$ anions is studied by making use of a lattice relaxation approach. We find there exists a Jahn-Teller effect in $C_{70}^{3-}$ system, due to an extra electron being doped to the double degenerate $E_{1}^{''}$ state. As a result of this effect, the original $D_{5h}$ symmetry of the ground state becomes unstable, which causes distortion of the lattice configuration. The only symmetry maintained in the final state of the relaxation is the $x-y$ plane reflection symmetry. We further find that besides the Jahn-Teller active $A_{1}^{'}, A_{2}^{'}, E_{2}^{'}$ modes, the non-Jahn-Teller active $E_{1}^{'}$ vibrations also contribute to the relaxation process, which come from the nonlinear effect and are two or three orders smaller than those of the Jahn-Teller active modes.

Beware of density dependent pair potentials,A. A. Louis,"Density (or state) dependent pair potentials arise naturally from coarse-graining procedures in many areas of condensed matter science. However, correctly using them to calculate physical properties of interest is subtle and cannot be uncoupled from the route by which they were derived. Furthermore, there is usually no unique way to coarse-grain to an effective pair potential. Even for simple systems like liquid Argon, the pair potential that correctly reproduces the pair structure will not generate the right virial pressure. Ignoring these issues in naive applications of density dependent pair potentials can lead to an apparent dependence of thermodynamic properties on the ensemble within which they are calculated, as well as other inconsistencies. These concepts are illustrated by several pedagogical examples, including: effective pair potentials for systems with many-body interactions, and the mapping of charged (Debye-H\""{u}ckel) and uncharged (Asakura-Oosawa) two-component systems onto effective one-component ones.",2002-05-07T10:51:48Z,2002-05-07T10:51:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0205110v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0205110v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"

Ab initio simulations of H2 in Li-doped carbon nanotube systems,"Abdenour Sabir, Wenchang Lu, Christopher Roland, Jerzy Bernholc","Because of their unique structure, it has been proposed that carbon nanotube ropes may well provide an ideal container for the storage of molecular hydrogen. Indeed, there has been some experimental evidence of enhanced hydrogen uptake in doped Li and other alkali metal systems [Chen et al, Science 285, 91 (1999)]. We have therefore addressed this issue of hydrogen storage in Li-doped graphite and carbon nanotube systems theoretically with ab initio simulations. Our results find no evidence for such enhanced storage, based on the induced structural changes. In addition, we have also investigated the diffusion barriers for hydrogen to enter into nanotube interiors, both in the presence and absence of topological defects. Even if nanotube interiors are made accessible, the hydrogen uptake remains modest, i.e., less than 3.5 wt%. Mechanically or chemically processing nanotubes is therefore not likely to lead to greatly increased hydrogen storage.",2006-08-18T19:53:32Z,2006-08-18T19:53:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0608432v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0608432v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Long-lived Giant Number Fluctuations in a Swarming Granular Nematic,"Vijay Narayan, Sriram Ramaswamy, Narayanan Menon","Coherently moving flocks of birds, beasts or bacteria are examples of living matter with spontaneous orientational order. How do these systems differ from thermal equilibrium systems with such liquid-crystalline order? Working with a fluidized monolayer of macroscopic rods in the nematic liquid crystalline phase, we find giant number fluctuations consistent with a standard deviation growing linearly with the mean, in contrast to any situation where the Central Limit Theorem applies. These fluctuations are long-lived, decaying only as a logarithmic function of time. This shows that flocking, coherent motion and large-scale inhomogeneity can appear in a system in which particles do not communicate except by contact.",2006-12-01T07:31:29Z,2007-06-14T11:17:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0612020v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0612020v2,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech"

Reasoning about transfinite sequences,"Stéphane Demri, David Nowak","We introduce a family of temporal logics to specify the behavior of systems with Zeno behaviors. We extend linear-time temporal logic LTL to authorize models admitting Zeno sequences of actions and quantitative temporal operators indexed by ordinals replace the standard next-time and until future-time operators. Our aim is to control such systems by designing controllers that safely work on $\omega$-sequences but interact synchronously with the system in order to restrict their behaviors. We show that the satisfiability problem for the logics working on $\omega^k$-sequences is EXPSPACE-complete when the integers are represented in binary, and PSPACE-complete with a unary representation. To do so, we substantially extend standard results about LTL by introducing a new class of succinct ordinal automata that can encode the interaction between the different quantitative temporal operators.",2005-05-26T09:33:24Z,2006-08-17T03:33:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0505073v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0505073v4,"cs.LO, cs.CC"

Our type system is an extension of previous behavioral type systems for the &#960;-calculus, and can guarantee the safety property that no invalid access is performed, as well as the property that necessary accesses (such as the close operation for a file) are eventually performed unless the program diverges. A sound type inference algorithm for the type system is also developed to free the programmer from the burden of writing complex type annotations.

In fact, we are lead to consider cocomplete quantaloid-enriched categories as fundamental mathematical structure for a dynamic logic common to both computer science and physics.

Thermodynamic derivation of reciprocal relations,Elias P. Gyftopoulos,"Reciprocal relations correlate fairly accurately a great variety of experimental results. Nevertheless, the concepts of statistical fluctuations, and microscopic reversibility - the bases of the accepted proof of the relations by Onsager - are illusory and faulty, and contradict the foundations of the science of thermodynamics. The definitions, postulates, and main theorems of thermodynamics are briefly presented. It is shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that thermodynamics is a nonstatistical science that applies to all systems (both macroscopic, and microscopic, including systems that consist either of only one structureless particle, or only one spin), to all states (both thermodynamic or stable equilibrium, and not stable equilibrium), and that includes entropy as a well defined, intrinsic, nonstatistical property of any system in any state, at any instant in time. In the light of this novel conception of thermodynamics, we find that reciprocal relations result from a well known mathematical theorem, to wit, given a well behaved analytic function of many variables then the second derivative of the function with respect to any two variables is independent of the order of differentiation, namely, whether the first derivative is taken with respect to the one or the other of the two variables.",2004-06-01T18:29:49Z,2004-07-13T16:35:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0406004v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0406004v2,physics.chem-ph

We propose a computational scheme which overcomes the notion of the transposition from classical circuits providing a computation scheme with the least possible number of Hamiltonians in order to minimize the physical resources needed to perform quantum computation and to succeed a minimization of the computational procedure (minimizing the number of computational steps needed to perform an arbitrary unitary transformation).

The building blocks are created based upon underpinning ideas from artificial immune systems and evolved using a genetic algorithm (Phase I). Each partial schedule (antibody) is assigned a fitness value and the best partial schedules are selected to be converted into complete schedules (antigens).

To achieve this target, the Bayesian optimization algorithm builds a Bayesian network of the joint probability distribution of the rules used to construct solutions, while the adapted classifier system assigns each rule a strength value that is constantly updated according to its usefulness in the current situation. Computational results from 52 real data instances of nurse scheduling demonstrate the success of both approaches.

Environment Assumptions for Synthesis,"Krishnendu Chatterjee, Thomas A.

Initial specifications are often unrealizable, which means that there is no system that implements the specification. A common reason for unrealizability is that assumptions on the environment of the system are incomplete. We study the problem of correcting an unrealizable specification $\phi$ by computing an environment assumption $\psi$ such that the new specification $\psi\to\phi$ is realizable. Our aim is to construct an assumption $\psi$ that constrains only the environment and is as weak as possible. We present a two-step algorithm for computing assumptions. The algorithm operates on the game graph that is used to answer the realizability question. First, we compute a safety assumption that removes a minimal set of environment edges from the graph. Second, we compute a liveness assumption that puts fairness conditions on some of the remaining environment edges.

Adversarial Scheduling in Evolutionary Game Dynamics,"Gabriel Istrate, Madhav V. Marathe, S. S.

This dynamics has been studied in (Kittock 94), (Dyer et al. 2002), (Mossel and Roch, 2006).   With random scheduling, starting from any initial configuration with high probability the system reaches the unique fixed point in which all players cooperate. This paper investigates the validity of this result under various classes of adversarial schedulers. Our results can be sumarized as follows:   1. An adversarial scheduler that can select both participants to the game can preclude the system from reaching the unique fixed point on most graph topologies. 2. A nonadaptive scheduler that is only allowed to choose one of the participants is no more powerful than a random scheduler. With this restriction even an adaptive scheduler is not significantly more powerful than the random scheduler, provided it is ""reasonably fair"".

Counting Complex Disordered States by Efficient Pattern Matching:   Chromatic Polynomials and Potts Partition Functions,"Marc Timme, Frank van Bussel, Denny Fliegner, Sebastian Stolzenberg","Counting problems, determining the number of possible states of a large system under certain constraints, play an important role in many areas of science. They naturally arise for complex disordered systems in physics and chemistry, in mathematical graph theory, and in computer science. Counting problems, however, are among the hardest problems to access computationally. Here, we suggest a novel method to access a benchmark counting problem, finding chromatic polynomials of graphs. We develop a vertex-oriented symbolic pattern matching algorithm that exploits the equivalence between the chromatic polynomial and the zero-temperature partition function of the Potts antiferromagnet on the same graph. Implementing this bottom-up algorithm using appropriate computer algebra, the new method outperforms standard top-down methods by several orders of magnitude, already for moderately sized graphs. As a first application, we compute chromatic polynomials of samples of the simple cubic lattice, for the first time computationally accessing three-dimensional lattices of physical relevance.

Improvement of Text Dependent Speaker Identification System Using   Neuro-Genetic Hybrid Algorithm in Office Environmental Conditions,"Md. Rabiul Islam, Md. Fayzur Rahman","In this paper, an improved strategy for automated text dependent speaker identification system has been proposed in noisy environment. The identification process incorporates the Neuro- Genetic hybrid algorithm with cepstral based features. To remove the background noise from the source utterance, wiener filter has been used. Different speech pre-processing techniques such as start-end point detection algorithm, pre-emphasis filtering, frame blocking and windowing have been used to process the speech utterances. RCC, MFCC, MFCC, MFCC, LPC and LPCC have been used to extract the features. After feature extraction of the speech, Neuro-Genetic hybrid algorithm has been used in the learning and identification purposes. Features are extracted by using different techniques to optimize the performance of the identification. According to the VALID speech database, the highest speaker identification rate of 100.000 percent for studio environment and 82.33 percent for office environmental conditions have been achieved in the close set text dependent speaker identification system.",2009-09-12T20:36:35Z,2009-09-12T20:36:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2363v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.2363v1,cs.SD
Self-Partial and Dynamic Reconfiguration Implementation for AES using   FPGA,"Zine El Abidine Alaoui Ismaili, Ahmed Moussa","This paper addresses efficient hardware/software implementation approaches for the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and describes the design and performance testing algorithm for embedded system. Also, with the spread of reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) embedded cryptographic hardware became cost-effective. Nevertheless, it is worthy to note that nowadays, even hardwired cryptographic algorithms are not so safe.   From another side, the self-reconfiguring platform is reported that enables an FPGA to dynamically reconfigure itself under the control of an embedded microprocessor. Hardware acceleration significantly increases the performance of embedded systems built on programmable logic. Allowing a FPGA-based MicroBlaze processor to self-select the coprocessors uses can help reduce area requirements and increase a system's versatility. The architecture proposed in this paper is an optimal hardware implementation algorithm and takes dynamic partially reconfigurable of FPGA.

Performing Hybrid Recommendation in Intermodal Transportation-the   FTMarket System's Recommendation Module,Alexis Lazanas,"Diverse recommendation techniques have been already proposed and encapsulated into several e-business applications, aiming to perform a more accurate evaluation of the existing information and accordingly augment the assistance provided to the users involved.

The module is built according to a novel hybrid recommendation technique, which combines the advantages of collaborative filtering and knowledge-based approaches. The proposed technique and supporting module assist customers in considering in detail alternative transportation transactions that satisfy their requests, as well as in evaluating completed transactions.

The proposed system takes into account the uncertainty and imprecision that can affect the statistical data of the historic. The systematic utilization of an unique probability distribution to represent this type of knowledge supposes a too rich subjective information and risk to be in part arbitrary.

Dependencies and Simultaneity in Membrane Systems,"G. Michele Pinna, Andrea Saba","Membrane system computations proceed in a synchronous fashion: at each step all the applicable rules are actually applied. Hence each step depends on the previous one. This coarse view can be refined by looking at the dependencies among rule occurrences, by recording, for an object, which was the a rule that produced it and subsequently (in a later step), which was the a rule that consumed it. In this paper we propose a way to look also at the other main ingredient in membrane system computations, namely the simultaneity in the rule applications. This is achieved using zero-safe nets that allows to synchronize transitions, i.e., rule occurrences. Zero-safe nets can be unfolded into occurrence nets in a classical way, and to this unfolding an event structure can be associated. The capability of capturing simultaneity of zero-safe nets is transferred on the level of event structure by adding a way to express which events occur simultaneously.",2009-11-26T00:39:34Z,2009-11-26T00:39:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4989v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.4989v1,"cs.CE, cs.DC, cs.LO, F.4.2; D.2.2"
High Availability Cluster System for Local Disaster Recovery with Markov   Modeling Approach,"T. T. Lwin, T. Thein","The need for high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) in IT environment is more stringent than most of the other sectors of enterprises. Many businesses require the availability of business-critical applications 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can afford no data loss in the event of a disaster. It is vital that the IT infrastructure is resilient with regard to disruption, even site failures, and that business operations can continue without significant impact. As a result, DR has gained great importance in IT. Clustering of multiple industries standard servers together to allow workload sharing and fail-over capabilities is a low cost approach.

Implementing and Evaluating a Wireless Body Sensor System for Automated   Physiological Data Acquisition at Home,"Chao Chen, Carlos Pomalaza-Raez","Advances in embedded devices and wireless sensor networks have resulted in new and inexpensive health care solutions. This paper describes the implementation and the evaluation of a wireless body sensor system that monitors human physiological data at home. Specifically, a waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer unit is used to record human movements. Sampled data are transmitted using an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless transceiver to a data logger unit. The wearable sensor unit is light, small, and consumes low energy, which allows for inexpensive and unobtrusive monitoring during normal daily activities at home. The acceleration measurement tests show that it is possible to classify different human motion through the acceleration reading. The 802.15.4 wireless signal quality is also tested in typical home scenarios. Measurement results show that even with interference from nearby IEEE 802.11 signals and microwave ovens, the data delivery performance is satisfactory and can be improved by selecting an appropriate channel. Moreover, we found that the wireless signal can be attenuated by housing materials, home appliances, and even plants.

Lumpability Abstractions of Rule-based Systems,"Jerome Feret, Thomas Henzinger, Heinz Koeppl, Tatjana Petrov","The induction of a signaling pathway is characterized by transient complex formation and mutual posttranslational modification of proteins. To faithfully capture this combinatorial process in a mathematical model is an important challenge in systems biology. Exploiting the limited context on which most binding and modification events are conditioned, attempts have been made to reduce the combinatorial complexity by quotienting the reachable set of molecular species, into species aggregates while preserving the deterministic semantics of the thermodynamic limit. Recently we proposed a quotienting that also preserves the stochastic semantics and that is complete in the sense that the semantics of individual species can be recovered from the aggregate semantics. In this paper we prove that this quotienting yields a sufficient condition for weak lumpability and that it gives rise to a backward Markov bisimulation between the original and aggregated transition system.

A Spatial-Epistemic Logic for Reasoning about Security Protocols,"Bernardo Toninho, Luís Caires","Reasoning about security properties involves reasoning about where the information of a system is located, and how it evolves over time. While most security analysis techniques need to cope with some notions of information locality and knowledge propagation, usually they do not provide a general language for expressing arbitrary properties involving local knowledge and knowledge transfer. Building on this observation, we introduce a framework for security protocol analysis based on dynamic spatial logic specifications. Our computational model is a variant of existing pi-calculi, while specifications are expressed in a dynamic spatial logic extended with an epistemic operator. We present the syntax and semantics of the model and logic, and discuss the expressiveness of the approach, showing it complete for passive attackers. We also prove that generic Dolev-Yao attackers may be mechanically determined for any deterministic finite protocol, and discuss how this result may be used to reason about security properties of open systems. We also present a model-checking algorithm for our logic, which has been implemented as an extension to the SLMC system.",2011-02-28T03:38:21Z,2011-02-28T03:38:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5584v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.5584v1,"cs.LO, cs.CR"

True Peer Review,Amit K. Chopra,"In computer science, conferences and journals conduct peer review in order to decide what to publish. Many have pointed out the inherent weaknesses in peer review, including those of bias, quality, and accountability. Many have suggested and adopted refinements of peer review, for instance, double blind peer review with author rebuttals.   In this essay, I argue that peer review as currently practiced conflates the sensible idea of getting comments on a paper with the irrevocably-flawed one that we either accept or reject the paper, which I term gatekeeping. If we look at the two separately, then it is clear that the ills associated with current peer review systems are not due to the practice of getting comments, but due to the practice of gatekeeping.   True peer review constitutes my proposal for replacing existing peer review systems. It embraces the idea of open debate on the merits of a paper; however, it rejects unequivocally the exercise of gatekeeping.

First Principles Modeling of the Temperature Dependent Ternary Phase   Diagram for the Cu-Pd-S System,"William Paul Huhn, Michael Widom, Michael C. Gao","As an aid to the development of hydrogen separation membranes, we predict the temperature dependent phase diagrams using first principles calculations combined with thermodynamic principles. Our method models the phase diagram without empirical fitting parameters. By applying thermodynamic principles and solid solution models, temperature-dependent features of the Cu-Pd-S system can be explained, specifically solubility ranges for substitutions in select crystalline phases. Electronic densities of states calculations explain the relative favorability of certain chemical substitutions. In addition, we calculate sulfidization thresholds for the Pd-S2 system and activities for the Cu-Pd binary in temperature regimes where the phase diagram contains multiple solid phases.",2013-03-14T18:07:47Z,2014-08-06T00:34:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3536v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3536v2,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Web Service Interface for Data Collection,"Ruchika Thukral, Anita Goel","Data collection is a key component of an information system. The widespread penetration of ICT tools in organizations and institutions has resulted in a shift in the way the data is collected. Data may be collected in printed-form, by e-mails, on a compact disk, or, by direct upload on the management information system. Since web services are platform-independent, it can access data stored in the XML format from any platform. In this paper, we present an interface which uses web services for data collection. It requires interaction between a web service deployed for the purposes of data collection, and the web address where the data is stored. Our interface requires that the web service has pre-knowledge of the address from where the data is to be collected. Also, the data to be accessed must be stored in XML format. Since our interface uses computer-supported interaction on both sides, it eases the task of regular and ongoing data collection.

Stochastic Parity Games on Lossy Channel Systems,"Parosh Aziz Abdulla, Lorenzo Clemente, Richard Mayr, Sven Sandberg","We give an algorithm for solving stochastic parity games with almost-sure winning conditions on lossy channel systems, for the case where the players are restricted to finite-memory strategies. First, we describe a general framework, where we consider the class of 2.5-player games with almost-sure parity winning conditions on possibly infinite game graphs, assuming that the game contains a finite attractor. An attractor is a set of states (not necessarily absorbing) that is almost surely re-visited regardless of the players' decisions. We present a scheme that characterizes the set of winning states for each player.

Dirac Fermions in Solids - from High Tc cuprates and Graphene to   Topological Insulators and Weyl Semimetals,"Oskar Vafek, Ashvin Vishwanath","Understanding Dirac-like Fermions has become an imperative in modern condensed matter sciences: all across its research frontier, from graphene to high T$_c$ superconductors to the topological insulators and beyond, various electronic systems exhibit properties which can be well described by the Dirac equation. Such physics is no longer the exclusive domain of quantum field theories and other esoteric mathematical musings; instead, real physics of real systems is governed by such equations, and important materials science and practical implications hinge on our understanding of Dirac particles in two and three dimensions. While the physics that gives rise to the massless Dirac Fermions in each of the above mentioned materials is different, the low energy properties are governed by the same Dirac kinematics.

Compositionality of Approximate Bisimulation for Probabilistic Systems,"Daniel Gebler, Simone Tini","Probabilistic transition system specifications using the rule format ntmuft-ntmuxt provide structural operational semantics for Segala-type systems and guarantee that probabilistic bisimilarity is a congruence. Probabilistic bisimilarity is for many applications too sensitive to the exact probabilities of transitions. Approximate bisimulation provides a robust semantics that is stable with respect to implementation and measurement errors of probabilistic behavior. We provide a general method to quantify how much a process combinator expands the approximate bisimulation distance. As a direct application we derive an appropriate rule format that guarantees compositionality with respect to approximate bisimilarity.

In particular, we explore the strong dependence of the electronic properties on the surface and interface termination, the finite film thickness, lattice polarization and defects. A further aspect that is addressed is how the electronic behavior and functionality can be tuned by a SrTiO3 capping layer, adsorbates and metallic contacts.

Resonant periodic orbits in the exoplanetary systems,"K. I. Antoniadou, G. Voyatzis","The planetary dynamics of $4/3$, $3/2$, $5/2$, $3/1$ and $4/1$ mean motion resonances is studied by using the model of the general three body problem in a rotating frame and by determining families of periodic orbits for each resonance. Both planar and spatial cases are examined. In the spatial problem, families of periodic orbits are obtained after analytical continuation of vertical critical orbits. The linear stability of orbits is also examined. Concerning initial conditions nearby stable periodic orbits, we obtain long-term planetary stability, while unstable orbits are associated with chaotic evolution that destabilizes the planetary system. Stable periodic orbits are of particular importance in planetary dynamics, since they can host real planetary systems. We found stable orbits up to $60^\circ$ of mutual planetary inclination, but in most families, the stability does not exceed $20^\circ$-$30^\circ$, depending on the planetary mass ratio. Most of these orbits are very eccentric. Stable inclined circular orbits or orbits of low eccentricity were found in the $4/3$ and $5/2$ resonance, respectively.",2013-10-29T19:31:35Z,2014-02-10T16:11:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7927v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7927v3,astro-ph.EP
Transport Information System using Query Centric Cyber Physical Systems   (QCPS),"Ankit Mundra, Geetanjali Rathee, Meenu Chawla, Nitin Rakesh, Ashsutosh Soni","To incorporate the computation and communication with the physical world, next generation architecture i.e. CPS is viewed as a new technology. To improve the better interaction with the physical world or to perk up the electricity delivery usage, various CPS based approaches have been introduced. Recently several GPS equipped smart phones and sensor based frameworks have been proposed which provide various services i.e. environment estimation, road safety improvement but encounter certain limitations like elevated energy consumption and high computation cost. To meet the high reliability and safety requirements, this paper introduces a novel approach based on QCPS model which provides several users services (discussed in this paper). Further, this paper proposed a Transport Information System (TIS), which provide the communication with lower cost overhead by arranging the similar sensors in the form of grids.

Partial Order Infinitary Term Rewriting,Patrick Bahr,"We study an alternative model of infinitary term rewriting. Instead of a metric on terms, a partial order on partial terms is employed to formalise convergence of reductions. We consider both a weak and a strong notion of convergence and show that the metric model of convergence coincides with the partial order model restricted to total terms. Hence, partial order convergence constitutes a conservative extension of metric convergence, which additionally offers a fine-grained distinction between different levels of divergence. In the second part, we focus our investigation on strong convergence of orthogonal systems. The main result is that the gap between the metric model and the partial order model can be bridged by extending the term rewriting system by additional rules. These extensions are the well-known B\""ohm extensions. Based on this result, we are able to establish that -- contrary to the metric setting -- orthogonal systems are both infinitarily confluent and infinitarily normalising in the partial order setting. The unique infinitary normal forms that the partial order model admits are B\""ohm trees.",2014-03-22T10:54:35Z,2014-06-02T14:48:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5644v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5644v2,cs.LO
An Abductive Framework for Horn Knowledge Base Dynamics,Radhakrishnan Delhibabu,"The dynamics of belief and knowledge is one of the major components of any autonomous system that should be able to incorporate new pieces of information. We introduced the Horn knowledge base dynamics to deal with two important points: first, to handle belief states that need not be deductively closed; and the second point is the ability to declare certain parts of the belief as immutable. In this paper, we address another, radically new approach to this problem. This approach is very close to the Hansson's dyadic representation of belief. Here, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. Based on this, we provide an abductive framework for Horn knowledge base dynamics.",2014-05-12T06:54:12Z,2014-05-22T16:29:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2642v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2642v2,"cs.LO, cs.AI, 68T15, 68T27, 68T35"
"Terahertz brightness at the extreme: demonstration of 5 GV/m, 17 T low   frequency λ3 terahertz bullet","Mostafa Shalaby, Christoph P. Hauri","The brightness of a light source defines its applicability to nonlinear phenomena in science. Bright low frequency terahertz (< 5THz) radiation confined to a diffraction-limited spot size is a present hurdle due to the broad bandwidth and long wavelengths associated with single-cycle terahertz pulses as well as due to the lack of terahertz wavefront correctors. Here, using a present-technology system, we employ a new concept of terahertz wavefront manipulation and focusing optimization. We demonstrate a spatio-temporal confinement of terahertz energy at its physical limits to the least possible 3-dimensional light bullet volume of lambda cubic. This leads to a new regime of extremely bright terahertz radiation reaching 40 PW/m2 intensity. The presented work is focused on the sub-5 THz range using small aperture organic crystals DSTMS and OH1. The obtained peak field of up to 5 GV/m and 17 Tesla is order of magnitude higher than any reported single-cycle field oscillation in the entire THz range from a laser-based system and surpassing large scale accelerator systems. The presented results are foreseen to have a great impact on future nonlinear terahertz applications in different science disciplines.",2014-07-07T10:35:31Z,2014-07-07T10:35:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1656v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1656v1,physics.optics

We show how to compute the winning set on $n$ vertices for (1) parity-3 (aka one-pair Streett) objectives in game graphs in time $O(n^{5/2})$ and for (2) k-pair Streett objectives in graphs in time $O(n^2 + nk \log n)$.

Heuristic Monte Carlo Method Applied to Cooperative Motion Algorithm for   Binary Lattice Fluid,"Piotr Knychala, Michal Banaszak","The Cooperative Motion Algorithm is an efficient lattice method to simulate dense polymer systems and is often used with two different criteria to generate a Markov chain in the configuration space. While the first method is the well-established Metropolis algorithm, the other one is an heuristic algorithm which needs justification. As an introductory step towards justification for the 3D lattice polymers, we study a simple system which is the binary equimolar uid on a 2D triangular lattice. Since all lattice sites are occupied only selected type of motions are considered, such the vacancy movements, swapping neighboring lattice sites (Kawasaki dynamics) and cooperative loops. We compare both methods, calculating the energy as well as heat capacity as a function of temperature. The critical temperature, which was determined using the Binder cumulant, was the same for all methods with the simulation accuracy and in agreement with the exact critical temperature for the Ising model on the 2D triangular lattice. In order to achieve reliable results at low temperatures we employ the parallel tempering algorithm which enables simultaneous simulations of replicas of the system in a wide range of temperatures.",2014-10-11T17:42:43Z,2014-10-11T17:42:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3015v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3015v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.CE"

In this work, we consider MIMO wiretap channels in a fast fading environment, for which the overall performance is characterized by the ergodic MIMO secrecy rate. Unfortunately, the direct solution to finding ergodic secrecy rates is prohibitive due to the expectations in the rates expressions in this setting. To overcome this difficulty, we invoke the large-system assumption, which allows a deterministic approximation to the ergodic mutual information. Leveraging results from random matrix theory, we are able to characterize the achievable ergodic secrecy rates. Based on this characterization, we address the problem of covariance optimization at the transmitter. Our numerical results demonstrate a good match between the large-system approximation and the actual simulated secrecy rates, as well as some interesting features of the precoder optimization.",2014-11-01T13:09:52Z,2014-11-01T13:09:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0114v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0114v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
A Language Support for Exhaustive Fault-Injection in Message-Passing   System Models,"Masaya Suzuki, Takuo Watanabe","This paper presents an approach towards specifying and verifying adaptive distributed systems. We here take fault-handling as an example of adaptive behavior and propose a modeling language Sandal for describing fault-prone message-passing systems. One of the unique mechanisms of the language is a linguistic support for abstracting typical faults such as unexpected termination of processes and random loss of messages. The Sandal compiler translates a model into a set of NuSMV modules. During the compilation process, faults specified in the model will be woven into the output. One can thus enjoy full-automatic exhaustive fault-injection without writing faulty behaviors explicitly.

To this end, we formalize a completeness proof for the DPLL proof system and extract a SAT solver from it. When applied to a propositional formula in conjunctive normal form the program produces either a satisfying assignment or a DPLL derivation showing its unsatisfiability. We use non-computational quantifiers to remove redundant computational content from the extracted program and translate it into Haskell to improve performance. We also prove the equivalence between the resolution proof system and the DPLL proof system with a bound on the size of the resulting resolution proof. This demonstrates that it is possible to capture quantitative information about the extracted program on the proof level.

By mining astronomical survey data, we have now found 195 compact elliptical galaxies in all types of environment. They all share similar dynamical and stellar population properties. Dynamical analysis for nonisolated galaxies demonstrates the feasibility of their ejection from host clusters and groups by three-body encounters, which is in agreement with numerical simulations.

The observed phenomenon was related to the existence of an exceptional point in the system and was presented somehow as an unexpected and novel effect, especially by some reporters and scientific blogs. In this communication it is pointed out that the phenomenon of loss-induced lasing does not come as a surprise in known laser theory and that it is not necessarily related to the physics of exceptional points. Loss-induced lasing is basically the lasing mechanism that occurs in loss-coupled distributed feedback lasers.

Formalization of Quantum Protocols using Coq,"Jaap Boender, Florian Kammüller, Rajagopal Nagarajan","Quantum Information Processing, which is an exciting area of research at the intersection of physics and computer science, has great potential for influencing the future development of information processing systems. The building of practical, general purpose Quantum Computers may be some years into the future. However, Quantum Communication and Quantum Cryptography are well developed. Commercial Quantum Key Distribution systems are easily available and several QKD networks have been built in various parts of the world. The security of the protocols used in these implementations rely on information-theoretic proofs, which may or may not reflect actual system behaviour. Moreover, testing of implementations cannot guarantee the absence of bugs and errors. This paper presents a novel framework for modelling and verifying quantum protocols and their implementations using the proof assistant Coq. We provide a Coq library for quantum bits (qubits), quantum gates, and quantum measurement.

Uncovering the Underlying Physics of Degrading System Behavior Through a   Deep Neural Network Framework: The Case of Remaining Useful Life Prognosis,"Sergio Cofre-Martel, Enrique Lopez Droguett, Mohammad Modarres","Deep learning (DL) has become an essential tool in prognosis and health management (PHM), commonly used as a regression algorithm for the prognosis of a system's behavior. One particular metric of interest is the remaining useful life (RUL) estimated using monitoring sensor data. Most of these deep learning applications treat the algorithms as black-box functions, giving little to no control of the data interpretation. This becomes an issue if the models break the governing laws of physics or other natural sciences when no constraints are imposed. The latest research efforts have focused on applying complex DL models to achieve a low prediction error rather than studying how the models interpret the behavior of the data and the system itself. In this paper, we propose an open-box approach using a deep neural network framework to explore the physics of degradation through partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework has three stages, and it aims to discover a latent variable and corresponding PDE to represent the health state of the system. Models are trained as a supervised regression and designed to output the RUL as well as a latent variable map that can be used and interpreted as the system's health indicator.",2020-06-10T21:05:59Z,2020-06-10T21:05:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09288v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09288v1,"eess.SP, cs.CE, cs.LG"
First-Order Reasoning and Efficient Semi-Algebraic Proofs,"Fedor Part, Neil Thapen, Iddo Tzameret","Semi-algebraic proof systems such as sum-of-squares (SoS) have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their relation to approximation algorithms: constant degree semi-algebraic proofs lead to conjecturally optimal polynomial-time approximation algorithms for important NP-hard optimization problems. Motivated by the need to allow a more streamlined and uniform framework for working with SoS proofs than the restrictive propositional level, we initiate a systematic first-order logical investigation into the kinds of reasoning possible in algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems. Specifically, we develop first-order theories that capture in a precise manner constant degree algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems: every statement of a certain form that is provable in our theories translates into a family of constant degree polynomial calculus or SoS refutations, respectively; and using a reflection principle, the converse also holds.   This places algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems in the established framework of bounded arithmetic, while providing theories corresponding to systems that vary quite substantially from the usual propositional-logic ones.   We give examples of how our semi-algebraic theory proves statements such as the pigeonhole principle, we provide a separation between algebraic and semi-algebraic theories, and we describe initial attempts to go beyond these theories by introducing extensions that use the inequality symbol, identifying along the way which extensions lead outside the scope of constant degree SoS. Moreover, we prove new results for propositional proofs, and specifically extend Berkholz's dynamic-by-static simulation of polynomial calculus (PC) by SoS to PC with the radical rule.",2021-05-16T22:20:55Z,2021-05-18T23:23:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07531v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07531v2,"cs.LO, cs.CC, F.2.2; F.4.1"
Superscalability of the random batch Ewald method,"Jiuyang Liang, Pan Tan, Yue Zhao, Lei Li, Shi Jin, Liang Hong, Zhenli Xu","Coulomb interaction, following an inverse-square force-law, quantifies the amount of force between two stationary and electrically charged particles. The long-range nature of Coulomb interactions poses a major challenge to molecular dynamics simulations which are major tools for problems at the nano-/micro- scale. Various algorithms are developed to calculate the pairwise Coulomb interactions to a linear scaling but the poor scalability limits the size of simulated systems. Here, we conduct an efficient molecular dynamics algorithm with the random batch Ewald method on all-atom systems where the complete Fourier components in the Coulomb interaction are replaced by randomly selected mini-batches. By simulating the $N$-body systems up to 100 million particles using $10$ thousand CPU cores, we show that this algorithm furnishes $O(N)$ complexity, almost perfect scalability and an order of magnitude faster computational speed when compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Further examinations of our algorithm on distinct systems, including pure water, micro-phase-separated electrolyte and protein solution demonstrate that the spatiotemporal information on all time and length scales investigated and thermodynamic quantities derived from our algorithm are in perfect agreement with those obtained from the existing algorithms. Therefore, our algorithm provides a breakthrough solution on scalability of computing the Coulomb interaction. It is particularly useful and cost-effective to simulate ultra-large systems, which was either impossible or very costing to conduct using existing algorithms, thus would benefit the broad community of sciences.",2021-06-10T04:50:23Z,2021-10-10T10:26:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05494v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05494v2,"physics.comp-ph, cs.CE"
Systems Astrochemistry: A New Doctrine for Experimental Studies,"Nigel J. Mason, Perry A. Hailey, Duncan V. Mifsud, James S. Urquhart","Laboratory experiments play a key role in deciphering the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the role that product complex organic molecules (COMs) may play in the origins of life. However, to date, most studies in experimental astrochemistry have made use of reductionist approaches to experimental design in which chemical responses to variations in a single parameter are investigated while all other parameters are held constant. Although such work does afford insight into the chemistry of the ISM, it is likely that several important points, such as the relative importance of an experimental parameter in determining the chemical outcome of a reaction and the interaction between parameters, remain ambiguous. In light of this, we propose adopting a new systems astrochemistry framework for experimental studies which draws on current work performed in the field of prebiotic chemistry, and present the basic tenants of such an approach in this article. This systems approach would focus on the emergent properties of the chemical system by performing the simultaneous variation of multiple experimental parameters and would allow for the effect of each parameter, as well as their interactions, to be quantified. We anticipate that the application of systems science to laboratory astrochemistry, coupled with developments in hyphenated analytical techniques and data analytics, will uncover significant new data hitherto unknown, and will aid in better linking laboratory experiments to observations and modelling work.",2021-07-06T22:20:19Z,2021-07-06T22:20:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02924v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02924v1,"astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM"
Heterogeneous relational message passing networks for molecular dynamics   simulations,"Zun Wang, Chong Wang, Sibo Zhao, Yong Xu, Shaogang Hao, Chang Yu Hsieh, Bing-Lin Gu, Wenhui Duan","With many frameworks based on message passing neural networks proposed to predict molecular and bulk properties, machine learning methods have tremendously shifted the paradigms of computational sciences underpinning physics, material science, chemistry, and biology. While existing machine learning models have yielded superior performances in many occasions, most of them model and process molecular systems in terms of homogeneous graph, which severely limits the expressive power for representing diverse interactions. In practice, graph data with multiple node and edge types is ubiquitous and more appropriate for molecular systems. Thus, we propose the heterogeneous relational message passing network (HermNet), an end-to-end heterogeneous graph neural networks, to efficiently express multiple interactions in a single model with {\it ab initio} accuracy. HermNet performs impressively against many top-performing models on both molecular and extended systems. Specifically, HermNet outperforms other tested models in nearly 75\%, 83\% and 94\% of tasks on MD17, QM9 and extended systems datasets, respectively. Finally, we elucidate how the design of HermNet is compatible with quantum mechanics from the perspective of the density functional theory. Besides, HermNet is a universal framework, whose sub-networks could be replaced by other advanced models.",2021-09-02T05:04:57Z,2021-09-02T05:04:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00711v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00711v1,"cs.LG, cond-mat.dis-nn"
Effectiveness of smearing and tetrahedron methods: best practices in DFT   codes,"Jeremy J. Jorgensen, Gus L. W. Hart","Density functional theory (DFT) codes are commonly treated as a ""black box"" in high-throughput screening of materials, with users opting for the default values of the input parameters. Often, non-experts may not sufficiently consider the effect of these parameters on prediction quality. In this work, we attempt to identify a robust set of parameters related to smearing and tetrahedron methods that return numerically accurate and efficient results for a wide variety of metallic systems. The effects of smearing and tetrahedron methods on the total energy, number of self-consistent field cycles, and forces on atoms are studied in two popular DFT codes: the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and Quantum Espresso (QE). From nearly 40,000 computations, it is apparent that the optimal smearing depends on the system, smearing method, smearing parameter, and $k$-point density. The benefit of smearing is a minor reduction in the number of self-consistent field cycles, which is independent of the smearing method or parameter. A large smearing parameter -- what is considered large is system dependent -- leads to inaccurate total energies and forces. Bl\""ochl's tetrahedron method leads to small improvements in total energies. When treating diverse systems with the same input parameters, we suggest using as little smearing as possible due to the system dependence of smearing and the risk of selecting a parameter that gives inaccurate energies and forces.",2021-09-02T20:03:01Z,2021-09-02T20:03:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01196v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01196v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Computational Fluid Dynamics on HPC   Systems,"Marius Kurz, Philipp Offenhäuser, Dominic Viola, Oleksandr Shcherbakov, Michael Resch, Andrea Beck","Reinforcement learning (RL) is highly suitable for devising control strategies in the context of dynamical systems. A prominent instance of such a dynamical system is the system of equations governing fluid dynamics. Recent research results indicate that RL-augmented computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers can exceed the current state of the art, for example in the field of turbulence modeling. However, while in supervised learning, the training data can be generated a priori in an offline manner, RL requires constant run-time interaction and data exchange with the CFD solver during training. In order to leverage the potential of RL-enhanced CFD, the interaction between the CFD solver and the RL algorithm thus have to be implemented efficiently on high-performance computing (HPC) hardware. To this end, we present Relexi as a scalable RL framework that bridges the gap between machine learning workflows and modern CFD solvers on HPC systems providing both components with its specialized hardware. Relexi is built with modularity in mind and allows easy integration of various HPC solvers by means of the in-memory data transfer provided by the SmartSim library. Here, we demonstrate that the Relexi framework can scale up to hundreds of parallel environment on thousands of cores. This allows to leverage modern HPC resources to either enable larger problems or faster turnaround times. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of an RL-augmented CFD solver by finding a control strategy for optimal eddy viscosity selection in large eddy simulations.",2022-05-13T08:21:18Z,2022-05-13T08:21:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06502v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06502v1,"cs.LG, cs.CE"
Event-triggered Consensus Control of Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems:   Model- and Data-based Analysis,"Xin Wang, Jian Sun, Gang Wang, Jie Chen","This article deals with model- and data-based consensus control of heterogenous leader-following multi-agent systems (MASs) under an event-triggering transmission scheme. A dynamic periodic transmission protocol is developed to significantly alleviate the transmission frequency and computational burden, where the followers can interact locally with each other approaching the dynamics of the leader. Capitalizing on a discrete-time looped-functional, a model-based consensus condition for the closed-loop MASs is derived in form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), as well as a design method for obtaining the distributed controllers and event-triggering parameters. Upon collecting noise-corrupted state-input measurements during open-loop operation, a data-driven leader-following MAS representation is presented, and employed to solve the data-driven consensus control problem without requiring any knowledge of the agents' models. This result is then extended to the case of guaranteeing an $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ performance. A simulation example is finally given to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed distributed event-triggering scheme in cutting off data transmissions and the data-driven design method.",2022-08-01T13:51:35Z,2022-08-01T13:51:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00867v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00867v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Lobster Eye X-ray Optics,"Rene Hudec, Charly Feldman","This chapter describes the history, principles, and recent developments of large field of view X-ray optics based on lobster eye designs. Most of grazing incidence (reflective) X-ray imaging systems used in astronomy and other applications, are based on the Wolter 1 (or modified) arrangement. But there are also other designs and configurations proposed for future applications for both laboratory and space environments. Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) based lenses as well as various types of lobster eye optics serve as an example. Analogously to Wolter lenses, all these systems use the principle that the X-rays are reflected twice to create focal images. Various future projects in X-ray astronomy and astrophysics will require large optics with wide fields of view. Both large Kirkpatrick-Baez modules and lobster eye X-ray telescopes may serve as solutions as these can offer innovations such as wide fields of view, low mass and reduced costs. The basic workings of lobster eye optics using Micro Pore Optics (MPOs) and their various uses are discussed. The issues and limiting factors of these optics are evaluated and current missions using lobster eye optics to fulfil their science objectives are reviewed. The Multi Foil Optics (MFO) approach represents a promising alternative. These arrangements can also be widely applied in laboratory devices. The chapter also examines the details of alternative applications for non-Wolter systems in other areas of science, where some of these systems have already demonstrated their advantages such as the K-B systems which have already found wide applications in laboratories and synchrotrons.",2022-08-15T12:51:15Z,2022-08-15T12:51:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07149v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07149v1,astro-ph.IM
Improving debris flow evacuation alerts in Taiwan using machine learning,"Yi-Lin Tsai, Jeremy Irvin, Suhas Chundi, Andrew Y. Ng, Christopher B. Field, Peter K. Kitanidis","Taiwan has the highest susceptibility to and fatalities from debris flows worldwide. The existing debris flow warning system in Taiwan, which uses a time-weighted measure of rainfall, leads to alerts when the measure exceeds a predefined threshold. However, this system generates many false alarms and misses a substantial fraction of the actual debris flows. Towards improving this system, we implemented five machine learning models that input historical rainfall data and predict whether a debris flow will occur within a selected time. We found that a random forest model performed the best among the five models and outperformed the existing system in Taiwan. Furthermore, we identified the rainfall trajectories strongly related to debris flow occurrences and explored trade-offs between the risks of missing debris flows versus frequent false alerts. These results suggest the potential for machine learning models trained on hourly rainfall data alone to save lives while reducing false alerts.",2022-08-27T14:39:58Z,2022-09-02T04:39:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13027v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13027v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
On the sampling complexity of open quantum systems,"Isobel A. Aloisio, Gregory A. L. White, Charles D. Hill, Kavan Modi","Open quantum systems are ubiquitous in the physical sciences, with widespread applications in the areas of chemistry, condensed matter physics, material science, optics, and many more. Not surprisingly, there is significant interest in their efficient simulation. However, direct classical simulation quickly becomes intractable with coupling to an environment whose effective dimension grows exponentially. This raises the question: can quantum computers help model these complex dynamics? A first step in answering this question requires understanding the computational complexity of this task. Here, we map the temporal complexity of a process to the spatial complexity of a many-body state using a computational model known as the process tensor framework. With this, we are able to explore the simulation complexity of an open quantum system as a dynamic sampling problem: a system coupled to an environment can be probed at successive points in time -- accessing multi-time correlations. The complexity of multi-time sampling, which is an important and interesting problem in its own right, contains the complexity of master equations and stochastic maps as a special case. Our results show how the complexity of the underlying quantum stochastic process corresponds to the complexity of the associated family of master equations for the dynamics. We present both analytical and numerical examples whose multi-time sampling is as complex as sampling from a many-body state that is classically hard. This also implies that the corresponding family of master equations are classically hard. Our results pave the way for studying open quantum systems from a complexity-theoretic perspective, highlighting the role quantum computers will play in our understanding of quantum dynamics.",2022-09-22T09:09:28Z,2022-09-22T09:09:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10870v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10870v1,quant-ph
Evaluating Search Systems through Field Codes and Classifications: The   Case of the First Published Swedish Nursing Study,Christopher Holmberg,"The aim of the study was to assess and compare established search systems and approaches by using the search goal of identifying the first (as in oldest) nursing-related document, with reference to the first Swedish-affiliated document, in Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed (Medline). In doing so, the objective was to provide concrete examples and illustrate how search systems and field code searches versus classification-based searches differ. The Scopus database, Web of Science database aggregator, and the PubMed (Medline) search engine were used for evaluations. Two different search strategies were compared in each database: one guided by field codes (i.e., text-based), and one guided by pre-existing categorizations within database infrastructures. Findings highlight several factors that are important to consider when formulating and executing a search strategy. The findings illustrate important aspects of search systems and search approaches, namely the publication year, delimitations related to a country or region, and features related to a subject or research area. The findings also highlight the importance of prioritizing between different ideals in retrieval. For example, is it more important to reach the oldest records (publication year), to identify as many records as possible (exhaustiveness), or to make sure they are as subject-relevant as possible (e.g., in terms of authors belonging to the same field)? Secondly, researchers using bibliometric methods to analyze research literature should be more transparent when reporting searches, as different search systems and search approaches yield varied numbers and quality of records.

Out-of-equilibrium interactions and collective locomotion of colloidal   spheres with squirming of nematoelastic multipoles,"Bohdan Senyuk, Jin-Sheng Wua, Ivan I. Smalyukh","Many living and artificial systems show a similar emergent behavior and collective motions on different scales, starting from swarms of bacteria to synthetic active particles, herds of mammals and crowds of people. What all these systems often have in common is that new collective properties like flocking emerge from interactions between individual self-propelled or externally driven units. Such systems are naturally out-of-equilibrium and propel at the expense of consumed energy. Mimicking nature by making self-propelled or externally driven particles and studying their individual and collective motility may allow for deeper understanding of physical underpinnings behind the collective motion of large groups of interacting objects or beings. Here, using a soft matter system of colloids immersed into a liquid crystal, we show that resulting so-called nematoelastic multipoles can be set into a bidirectional locomotion by external periodically oscillating electric fields. Out-of-equilibrium elastic interactions between such colloids lead to collective flock-like behaviors, which emerge from time-varying elasticity-mediated interactions between externally driven propelling particles. The repulsive elastic interactions in the equilibrium state can be turned into attractive interactions in the out-of-equilibrium state under applied electric fields. We probe this behavior at different number densities of colloidal particles and show that particles in a dense dispersion collectively select the same direction of a coherent motion due to elastic interactions between near neighbors. In our experimentally implemented design, their motion is highly ordered and without clustering or jamming often present in other colloidal transport systems, which is promising for technological and fundamental-science applications, like nano-cargo transport, out-of-equilibrium assembly and microrobotics.",2023-12-29T04:42:21Z,2023-12-29T04:42:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17470v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17470v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Optimizing a Data Science System for Text Reuse Analysis,"Ananth Mahadevan, Michael Mathioudakis, Eetu Mäkelä, Mikko Tolonen","Text reuse is a methodological element of fundamental importance in humanities research: pieces of text that re-appear across different documents, verbatim or paraphrased, provide invaluable information about the historical spread and evolution of ideas. Large modern digitized corpora enable the joint analysis of text collections that span entire centuries and the detection of large-scale patterns, impossible to detect with traditional small-scale analysis. For this opportunity to materialize, it is necessary to develop efficient data science systems that perform the corresponding analysis tasks.   In this paper, we share insights from ReceptionReader, a system for analyzing text reuse in large historical corpora. The system is built upon billions of instances of text reuses from large digitized corpora of 18th-century texts. Its main functionality is to perform downstream text reuse analysis tasks, such as finding reuses that stem from a given article or identifying the most reused quotes from a set of documents, with each task expressed as a database query. For the purposes of the paper, we discuss the related design choices including various database normalization levels and query execution frameworks, such as distributed data processing (Apache Spark), indexed row store engine (MariaDB Aria), and compressed column store engine (MariaDB Columnstore). Moreover, we present an extensive evaluation with various metrics of interest (latency, storage size, and computing costs) for varying workloads, and we offer insights from the trade-offs we observed and the choices that emerged as optimal in our setting. In summary, our results show that (1) for the workloads that are most relevant to text-reuse analysis, the MariaDB Aria framework emerges as the overall optimal choice, (2) big data processing (Apache Spark) is irreplaceable for all processing stages of the system's pipeline.",2024-01-14T13:51:37Z,2024-01-14T13:51:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07290v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07290v1,cs.DB
Turing pattern theory on homogeneous and heterogeneous higher-order   temporal network system,Junyuan Shi,"Reaction-diffusion processes on networked systems have received mounting attention in the past two decades, and the corresponding network dynamics theories have been continuously enriched with the advancement of network science. Recently, time-varying feature and many-body interactions have been discovered on various and numerous networks in real world like biological and social systems, and the study of contemporary network science has gradually moved away from the historically static network frameworks that are based on pairwise interactions. We are aimed to propose a general and rudimentary framework for Turing instability of reaction-diffusion processes on higher-order temporal networks. Firstly, we define a brand Laplacian to depict higher-order temporal diffusion behaviors on networks. Furthermore, the general form of higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion systems with frequency of oscillation is defined, and a time-independent and concise form is obtained by equivalent substitution and method of averaging. Next, we discuss the two cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous network systems and give the equivalent conditions of Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Finally, in the numerical simulation part, we verify and discuss the validity of the above theoretical framework and study the effect of the frequency of oscillation of higher-order temporal network on reaction-diffusion processes. Our study has revealed that higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion, which takes into account both time-varying feature and many-body interactions, can formulate innovative and diversified patterns.

Standardizing Knowledge Engineering Practices with a Reference   Architecture,"Bradley P.

Throughout the history of computer science and AI, knowledge engineering workflows have been widely used given the importance of high-quality knowledge for reliable intelligent agents. Meanwhile, the scope of knowledge engineering, as apparent from its target tasks and use cases, has been shifting, together with its paradigms such as expert systems, semantic web, and language modeling. The intended use cases and supported user requirements between these paradigms have not been analyzed globally, as new paradigms often satisfy prior pain points while possibly introducing new ones. The recent abstraction of systemic patterns into a boxology provides an opening for aligning the requirements and use cases of knowledge engineering with the systems, components, and software that can satisfy them best. This paper proposes a vision of harmonizing the best practices in the field of knowledge engineering by leveraging the software engineering methodology of creating reference architectures. We describe how a reference architecture can be iteratively designed and implemented to associate user needs with recurring systemic patterns, building on top of existing knowledge engineering workflows and boxologies. We provide a six-step roadmap that can enable the development of such an architecture, providing an initial design and outcome of the definition of architectural scope, selection of information sources, and analysis. We expect that following through on this vision will lead to well-grounded reference architectures for knowledge engineering, will advance the ongoing initiatives of organizing the neurosymbolic knowledge engineering space, and will build new links to the software architectures and data science communities.",2024-04-04T17:46:32Z,2024-04-04T17:46:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03624v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03624v1,"cs.AI, cs.SE"

Efficient and accurate monitoring of coral reefs is crucial for their conservation and management. In this paper, we present an automatic coral detection system utilizing the You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep learning model, which is specifically tailored for underwater imagery analysis. To train and evaluate our system, we employ a dataset consisting of 400 original underwater images. We increased the number of annotated images to 580 through image manipulation using data augmentation techniques, which can improve the model's performance by providing more diverse examples for training. The dataset is carefully collected from underwater videos that capture various coral reef environments, species, and lighting conditions. Our system leverages the YOLOv5 algorithm's real-time object detection capabilities, enabling efficient and accurate coral detection. We used YOLOv5 to extract discriminating features from the annotated dataset, enabling the system to generalize, including previously unseen underwater images. The successful implementation of the automatic coral detection system with YOLOv5 on our original image dataset highlights the potential of advanced computer vision techniques for coral reef research and conservation.

Despite this rather universal trend, the essential hinge between CDW and superconductivity has not been established yet. Here, the evidence of coupling between electron and CDW fluctuation is reported, based on a temperature- and intercalation-dependent kink in the angle-resolved photoemission spectra of 2H-PdxTaSe2. Kinks are observed only when the system is in the CDW phase, regardless of whether a long- or short-range order is established. Notably, the coupling strength is enhanced upon long-range CDW suppression, albeit the coupling energy scale is reduced. Interestingly, estimation of the superconducting critical temperature by incorporating the observed coupling characteristics into McMillan's equation yields result closely resembling the known values of the superconducting dome. Our results thus highlight a compelling possibility that this new coupling mediates Cooper pairs, which provides new insights on the competing relationship not only for CDW, but also for other competing orders.",2024-08-15T03:12:33Z,2024-08-15T03:12:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07901v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07901v1,"cond-mat.supr-con, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"

Towards the Usage of Window Counting Constraints in the Synthesis of   Reactive Systems to Reduce State Space Explosion,"Linda Feeken, Martin Fränzle","The synthesis of reactive systems aims for the automated construction of strategies for systems that interact with their environment. Whereas the synthesis approach has the potential to change the development of reactive systems significantly due to the avoidance of manual implementation, it still suffers from a lack of efficient synthesis algorithms for many application scenarios. The translation of the system specification into an automaton that allows for strategy construction is nonelementary in the length of the specification in S1S and double exponential for LTL, raising the need of highly specialized algorithms. In this paper, we present an approach on how to reduce this state space explosion in the construction of this automaton by exploiting a monotony property of specifications. For this, we introduce window counting constraints that allow for step-wise refinement or abstraction of specifications. In an iterating synthesis procedure, those window counting constraints are used to construct automata representing over- or under-approximations (depending on the counting constraint) of constraint-compliant behavior. Analysis results on winning regions of previous iterations are used to reduce the size of the next automaton, leading to an overall reduction of the state space explosion extend. We present the implementation results of the iterated synthesis for a zero-sum game setting as proof of concept. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations of the approach in a zero-sum setting and sketch future work in non-zero-sum settings.",2024-10-30T07:29:02Z,2024-10-30T07:29:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00048v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00048v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT"
It's complicated. The relationship of algorithmic fairness and   non-discrimination regulations in the EU AI Act,Kristof Meding,"What constitutes a fair decision? This question is not only difficult for humans but becomes more challenging when Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are used. In light of discriminatory algorithmic behaviors, the EU has recently passed the AI Act, which mandates specific rules for AI models, incorporating both traditional legal non-discrimination regulations and machine learning based algorithmic fairness concepts. This paper aims to bridge these two different concepts in the AI Act through: First a high-level introduction of both concepts targeting legal and computer science-oriented scholars, and second an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's relationship between legal non-discrimination regulations and algorithmic fairness. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1.), most non-discrimination regulations target only high-risk AI systems. (2.), the regulation of high-risk systems encompasses both data input requirements and output monitoring, though these regulations are often inconsistent and raise questions of computational feasibility. (3.) Regulations for General Purpose AI Models, such as Large Language Models that are not simultaneously classified as high-risk systems, currently lack specificity compared to other regulations. Based on these findings, we recommend developing more specific auditing and testing methodologies for AI systems. This paper aims to serve as a foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration between legal scholars and computer science-oriented machine learning researchers studying discrimination in AI systems.",2025-01-22T15:38:09Z,2025-01-22T15:38:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12962v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12962v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY"
Learning the Hamiltonian Matrix of Large Atomic Systems,"Chen Hao Xia, Manasa Kaniselvan, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas, Marko Mladenović, Rayen Mahjoub, Alexander Maeder, Mathieu Luisier","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning the ground-state electronic properties of materials, subverting ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations when the underlying lattices can be represented as small and/or repeatable unit cells (i.e., molecules and periodic crystals). Realistic systems are, however, non-ideal and generally characterized by higher structural complexity. As such, they require large (10+ Angstroms) unit cells and thousands of atoms to be accurately described. At these scales, DFT becomes computationally prohibitive, making GNNs especially attractive. In this work, we present a strictly local equivariant GNN capable of learning the electronic Hamiltonian (H) of realistically extended materials. It incorporates an augmented partitioning approach that enables training on arbitrarily large structures while preserving local atomic environments beyond boundaries. We demonstrate its capabilities by predicting the electronic Hamiltonian of various systems with up to 3,000 nodes (atoms), 500,000+ edges, ~28 million orbital interactions (nonzero entries of H), and $\leq$0.55% error in the eigenvalue spectra.

The Exoplanet Orbital Eccentricity - Multiplicity Relation and the Solar   System,"Mary Anne Limbach, Edwin L. Turner","The known population of exoplanets exhibits a much wider range of orbital eccentricities than Solar System planets and has a much higher average eccentricity. These facts have been widely interpreted to indicate that the Solar System is an atypical member of the overall population of planetary systems. We report here on a strong anti-correlation of orbital eccentricity with multiplicity (number of planets in the system) among catalogued radial velocity (RV) systems. The mean, median and rough distribution of eccentricities of Solar System planets fits an extrapolation of this anti-correlation to the eight planet case rather precisely despite the fact that no more than 2 Solar System planets would be detectable with RV data comparable to that in the exoplanet sample. Moreover, even if regarded as a single or double planetary system, the Solar System lies in a reasonably heavily populated region of eccentricity-multiplicity space. Thus, the Solar System is not anomalous among known exoplanetary systems with respect to eccentricities when its multiplicity is taken into account. Specifically, as the multiplicity of a system increases the eccentricity decreases roughly as a power law of index -1.20. A simple and plausible but ad hoc and model-dependent interpretation of this relationship implies that approximately 80% of the one planet and 25% of the two planet systems in our sample have additional, as yet undiscovered, members but that systems of higher observed multiplicity are largely complete (i.e., relatively rarely contain additional undiscovered planets). If low eccentricities indeed favor high multiplicities, habitability may be more common in systems with a larger number of planets.",2014-04-09T17:20:50Z,2014-12-01T15:54:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2552v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2552v3,astro-ph.EP
Polymorphic Iterable Sequential Effect Systems,Colin S. Gordon,"Effect systems are lightweight extensions to type systems that can verify a wide range of important properties with modest developer burden. But our general understanding of effect systems is limited primarily to systems where the order of effects is irrelevant. Understanding such systems in terms of a semilattice of effects grounds understanding of the essential issues, and provides guidance when designing new effect systems. By contrast, sequential effect systems -- where the order of effects is important -- lack an established algebraic structure on effects.   We present an abstract polymorphic effect system parameterized by an effect quantale -- an algebraic structure with well-defined properties that can model the effects of a range of existing sequential effect systems. We define effect quantales, derive useful properties, and show how they cleanly model a variety of known sequential effect systems.   We show that for most effect quantales, there is an induced notion of iterating a sequential effect; that for systems we consider the derived iteration agrees with the manually designed iteration operators in prior work; and that this induced notion of iteration is as precise as possible when defined. We also position effect quantales with respect to work on categorical semantics for sequential effect systems, clarifying the distinctions between these systems and our own in the course of giving a thorough survey of these frameworks. Our derived iteration construct should generalize to these semantic structures, addressing limitations of that work. Finally, we consider the relationship between sequential effects and Kleene Algebras, where the latter may be used as instances of the former.",2018-08-06T17:57:13Z,2021-07-15T15:26:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02010v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02010v6,"cs.PL, cs.LO"

Invariants and Labels in Lie-Poisson Systems,"Jean-Luc Thiffeault, P. J. Morrison","Reduction is a process that uses symmetry to lower the order of a Hamiltonian system. The new variables in the reduced picture are often not canonical: there are no clear variables representing positions and momenta, and the Poisson bracket obtained is not of the canonical type. Specifically, we give two examples that give rise to brackets of the noncanonical Lie-Poisson form: the rigid body and the two-dimensional ideal fluid. From these simple cases, we then use the semidirect product extension of algebras to describe more complex physical systems. The Casimir invariants in these systems are examined, and some are shown to be linked to the recovery of information about the configuration of the system. We discuss a case in which the extension is not a semidirect product, namely compressible reduced MHD, and find for this case that the Casimir invariants lend partial information about the configuration of the system.",1998-04-20T20:08:19Z,1998-04-20T20:08:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/chao-dyn/9804032v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/chao-dyn/9804032v1,"chao-dyn, math-ph, math.MP, nlin.CD"
Integrating Text Plans for Conciseness and Coherence,"Terrence Harvey, Sandra Carberry","Our experience with a critiquing system shows that when the system detects problems with the user's performance, multiple critiques are often produced. Analysis of a corpus of actual critiques revealed that even though each individual critique is concise and coherent, the set of critiques as a whole may exhibit several problems that detract from conciseness and coherence, and consequently assimilation. Thus a text planner was needed that could integrate the text plans for individual communicative goals to produce an overall text plan representing a concise, coherent message.   This paper presents our general rule-based system for accomplishing this task. The system takes as input a \emph{set} of individual text plans represented as RST-style trees, and produces a smaller set of more complex trees representing integrated messages that still achieve the multiple communicative goals of the individual text plans. Domain-independent rules are used to capture strategies across domains, while the facility for addition of domain-dependent rules enables the system to be tuned to the requirements of a particular domain. The system has been tested on a corpus of critiques in the domain of trauma care.",1998-05-28T18:14:12Z,1998-05-28T18:14:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9805010v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cmp-lg/9805010v1,"cmp-lg, cs.CL"

After a brief discussion of the relation between an evolving state-system and an information structure, we develop an algebra of information pieces (infons) to represent the structure of systems where descriptions of complex systems are constructed from expressions involving descriptions of simpler information systems.

Coverage metrics attempt to check which parts of a system are actually relevant for the verification process to succeed. Recent work on coverage in model checking suggests several coverage metrics and algorithms for finding parts of the system that are not covered by the specification. The work has already proven to be effective in practice, detecting design errors that escape early verification efforts in industrial settings. In this paper, we relate a formal definition of causality given by Halpern and Pearl [2001] to coverage. We show that it gives significant insight into unresolved issues regarding the definition of coverage and leads to potentially useful extensions of coverage.

Model checking is a technique which is able to verify finite-state systems with a huge number of states in an automatic way. In the last years several studies have investigated how to extend model checking techniques to systems with an infinite number of states. In this paper we propose an approach which exploits the computation model of tccp. Constraint based computations allow us to define a methodology for applying a model checking algorithm to (a class of) infinite-state systems. We extend the classical algorithm of model checking for LTL to a specific logic defined for the verification of tccp and to the tccp Structure which we define in this work for modeling the program behavior.

Our contribution is a system of compositional static analyses to guarantee that each instant terminates and to bound the size of the values computed by the system as a function of the size of its parameters at the beginning of the instant. Our method generalises an approach designed for first-order functional languages that relies on a combination of standard termination techniques for term rewriting systems and an analysis of the size of the computed values based on the notion of quasi-interpretation. We show that these two methods can be combined to obtain an explicit polynomial bound on the resources needed for the execution of the system during an instant. As a second contribution, we introduce a virtual machine and a related bytecode thus producing a precise description of the resources needed for the execution of a system. In this context, we present a suitable control flow analysis that allows to formulte the static analyses for resource control at byte code level.",2005-12-14T13:41:07Z,2005-12-14T13:41:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0512057v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0512057v1,cs.PL

In addition, we also point out that even in systems with a large number of components, only a few may be of statistically great significance, just as in Zipf's law the quantitative measure of the important collections is inversely proportional to the rank. We then consider the concept of relative degeneracies coming from change of resolving power, at various scales, which too would vindicate the procedure of coarse-graining in building up hierarchical organizations. We suggest that, similar to the group-theoretical annihilation of dangling tensor indices due to symmetry to minimize energy, even in more inexact contexts such as in biology and the social sciences, similar attempts by the system to reduce frustration may lead to cluster formation, which are semi-closed, and let leakage interactions come into play at larger scales.",2006-09-03T20:33:44Z,2006-09-03T20:33:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0609005v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0609005v1,"nlin.AO, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.soc-ph"
Physics and Logical Openness in Cognitive Models,Ignazio Licata,"It is here proposed an analysis of symbolic and sub-symbolic models for studying cognitive processes, centered on emergence and logical openness notions.The Theory of Logical Openness connects the Physics of system/environment relationships to system informational structure. In this theory cognitive models can be ordered according to a hierarchy of complexity depending on their logical openness degree, and their descriptive limits are related to Godel-Turing Theorems on formal systems. The sysmbolic models with low logical openness describe cognition by means of semantics which fix the system/environment relationship (cognition in vitro), while the sub-symbolic ones with high logical openness tends to seize its evolutive dynamics (cognition in vivo. An observer is defined as a system with high logical openness.

Communicating Quantum Processes,"Simon Gay, Rajagopal Nagarajan","We define a language CQP (Communicating Quantum Processes) for modelling systems which combine quantum and classical communication and computation. CQP combines the communication primitives of the pi-calculus with primitives for measurement and transformation of quantum state; in particular, quantum bits (qubits) can be transmitted from process to process along communication channels. CQP has a static type system which classifies channels, distinguishes between quantum and classical data, and controls the use of quantum state. We formally define the syntax, operational semantics and type system of CQP, prove that the semantics preserves typing, and prove that typing guarantees that each qubit is owned by a unique process within a system. We illustrate CQP by defining models of several quantum communication systems, and outline our plans for using CQP as the foundation for formal analysis and verification of combined quantum and classical systems.",2004-09-09T10:35:24Z,2004-09-09T10:35:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409052v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0409052v1,quant-ph
Algorithmic Integrability Tests for Nonlinear Differential and Lattice   Equations,"Willy Hereman, Unal Goktas, Michael D. Colagrosso, Antonio J.

The first algorithm is the well-known Painlev\'e test, which is applicable to polynomial systems of ordinary and partial differential equations. The second and third algorithms allow one to explicitly compute polynomial conserved densities and higher-order symmetries of nonlinear evolution and lattice equations.   The first algorithm is implemented in the symbolic syntax of both Macsyma and Mathematica. The second and third algorithms are available in Mathematica. The codes can be used for computer-aided integrability testing of nonlinear differential and lattice equations as they occur in various branches of the sciences and engineering.

Terrestrial and Habitable Planet Formation in Binary and Multi-star   Systems,"Nader Haghighipour, Steinn Sigurdsson, Jack Lissauer, Sean Raymond","One of the most surprising discoveries of extrasolar planets is the detection of planets in moderately close binary star systems. The Jovian-type planets in the two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefront questions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of the existence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. The diverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonder to what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied to binaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of the detection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies in binary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with the recent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection of more planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on the horizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial and habitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamental insights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategic impact on NASA science and missions.",2007-04-06T02:34:35Z,2007-04-06T02:34:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0832v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0832v1,astro-ph
Acyclic Preference Systems in P2P Networks,"Anh-Tuan Gai, Dmitry Lebedev, Fabien Mathieu, Fabien De Montgolfier, Julien Reynier, Laurent Viennot","In this work we study preference systems natural for the Peer-to-Peer paradigm. Most of them fall in three categories: global, symmetric and complementary. All these systems share an acyclicity property. As a consequence, they admit a stable (or Pareto efficient) configuration, where no participant can collaborate with better partners than their current ones. We analyze the representation of the such preference systems and show that any acyclic system can be represented with a symmetric mark matrix. This gives a method to merge acyclic preference systems and retain the acyclicity. We also consider such properties of the corresponding collaboration graph, as clustering coefficient and diameter. In particular, studying the example of preferences based on real latency measurements, we observe that its stable configuration is a small-world graph.",2007-04-30T09:26:39Z,2007-05-02T13:07:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3904v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3904v2,"cs.DS, cs.GT"
Ordering effects in diluted magnetic semiconductors,"Josef Kudrnovský, V.

In the first step we construct, on the basis of the state-of-the-art first-principles electronic structure calculations, the effective Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians which describe, respectively, the alloy phase stability and the magnetic excitations in the system. In the second step, we analyze properties of these effective Hamiltonians by various methods of statistical physics. As a case study, the prototypical diluted magnetic semiconductor Ga_{1-x}Mn_{x}As is studied in detail. We determine, among others, a possibility for clustering in this system, formation energies of various compensating defects, and estimate short-range order parameters describing ordering tendencies in a system. On the other hand, by using recently developed local random-phase approximation approach, we evaluate the system Curie temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence on the sample preparation. We also emphasize the relevance of proper inclusion of the randomness in positions of magnetic impurities for a reliable estimate of the system critical temperature.

The setup and measurement methodology are presented, along with details of the calibration process required to convert changes in measured surface reflectivity to absolute temperatures. To demonstrate the system's capabilities, standard gold micro-resistors are activated and their surface temperature fields are measured.

Some properties of the regular asynchronous systems,Serban E. Vlad,"The asynchronous systems are the models of the asynchronous circuits from the digital electrical engineering. An asynchronous system f is a multi-valued function that assigns to each admissible input u a set f(u) of possible states x in f(u). A special case of asynchronous system consists in the existence of a Boolean function \Upsilon such that for any u and any x in f(u), a certain equation involving \Upsilon is fulfilled. Then \Upsilon is called the generator function of f (Moisil used the terminology of network function) and we say that f is generated by \Upsilon. The systems that have a generator function are called regular.   Our purpose is to continue the study of the generation of the asynchronous systems that was started in [2], [3].",2008-04-13T01:11:43Z,2008-04-13T01:11:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2037v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.2037v1,cs.OH

The separation between sources 1 and 2 is ~0.9"" or 360 AU. The spectral energy distribution suggests that the 6.9 mm flux is almost entirely from dust. The 6.9 mm image and the spectrum suggest that HH 24 MMS may be a protostellar binary system. Total mass including the accretion disks and the inner protostellar envelope is ~1.4 Msun. Disk masses of sources 1 and 2 are 0.6 and 0.3 Msun, respectively. Both sources are highly elongated. The difference in the position angle of the two disks is ~45 degree, which means that HH 24 MMS is a highly misaligned protobinary system. The misalignment suggests that turbulent fragmentation may be the formation mechanism relevant to the binary systems with a separation of a few hundreds of AU, such as the HH 24 MMS system.",2008-05-05T01:17:48Z,2008-05-05T01:17:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0451v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.0451v1,astro-ph
A Counterexample Guided Abstraction-Refinement Framework for Markov   Decision Processes,"Rohit Chadha, Mahesh Viswanthan","The main challenge in using abstractions effectively, is to construct a suitable abstraction for the system being verified. One approach that tries to address this problem is that of {\it counterexample guided abstraction-refinement (CEGAR)}, wherein one starts with a coarse abstraction of the system, and progressively refines it, based on invalid counterexamples seen in prior model checking runs, until either an abstraction proves the correctness of the system or a valid counterexample is generated. While CEGAR has been successfully used in verifying non-probabilistic systems automatically, CEGAR has not been applied in the context of probabilistic systems. The main issues that need to be tackled in order to extend the approach to probabilistic systems is a suitable notion of ``counterexample'', algorithms to generate counterexamples, check their validity, and then automatically refine an abstraction based on an invalid counterexample. In this paper, we address these issues, and present a CEGAR framework for Markov Decision Processes.",2008-07-08T19:47:11Z,2008-07-08T19:47:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1173v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.1173v1,"cs.SE, cs.LO, D.2.4"
Tailor-made Quantum Well-in-a-Well Systems: Their Bound States and   Scattering Properties,"Naomi Jane Jacosalem, Cristine Villagonzalo","The resulting stationary states and scattering properties of an effective potential brought about by embedding a quantum well in another well are investigated in this work. The composite well system is constructed via a superposition of modified Poeschl - Teller potential wells. The energy spectrum in each composite well is obtained using the shooting method and the transport of a particle above this system is analyzed using the transfer matrix method. It is shown that decreasing the size of the embedded middle well lowers the ground state energy of the well-in-a-well system. Moreover, the bound states increase in number and become more evenly spaced. In addition, the transmission probability of a free particle incident above a composite well is lowest for the system with a large embedded well as compared to well-in-a-well systems of the same depth.

Searching bifurcations in high-dimensional parameter space via a   feedback loop breaking approach,"Steffen Waldherr, Frank Allgöwer","Bifurcations leading to complex dynamical behaviour of non-linear systems are often encountered when the characteristics of feedback circuits in the system are varied. In systems with many unknown or varying parameters, it is an interesting, but difficult problem to find parameter values for which specific bifurcations occur. In this paper, we develop a loop breaking approach to evaluate the influence of parameter values on feedback circuit characteristics. This approach allows a theoretical classification of feedback circuit characteristics related to possible bifurcations in the system. Based on the theoretical results, a numerical algorithm for bifurcation search in a possibly high-dimensional parameter space is developed. The application of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by searching for a Hopf bifurcation in a model of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is a classical example for biochemical signal transduction.",2008-12-01T10:46:58Z,2010-09-22T13:40:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0256v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.0256v2,"q-bio.MN, math.DS"

For system sizes that are accessible to numerical simulations at reasonable strain rates and at low temperatures the magnitude of plastic events grows with the system size. We explain however that this must be a finite size effect; for larger systems there exist two cross-over length-scales $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$, the first determined by the elastic time-scale and the second by the thermal energy-scale. For system of linear size $L$ larger than any of these scales the magnitude of plastic events must be bounded. For systems of size $L\gg \xi$ there must exist $(L/\xi)^d$ uncorrelated plastic events which occur simultaneously. We present a scaling theory that culminates with the dependence of the cross-over scales on temperature and strain rate. Finally we relate these findings to the temperature and size dependence of the stress fluctuations.

Fluctuation-dissipation relations far from equilibrium,Jianhua Xing,"The fluctuation-dissipation (F-D) theorem is a fundamental result for systems near thermodynamic equilibrium, and justifies studies between microscopic and macroscopic properties. It states that the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics is related to the spontaneous fluctuation at equilibrium. Most processes in Nature are out of equilibrium, for which we have limited theory. Common wisdom believes the F-D theorem is violated in general for systems far from equilibrium. Recently we show that dynamics of a dissipative system described by stochastic differential equations can be mapped to that of a thermostated Hamiltonian system, with a nonequilibrium steady state of the former corresponding to the equilibrium state of the latter. Her we derived the corresponding F-D theorem, and tested with several examples. We suggest further studies exploiting the analogy between a general dissipative system appearing in various science branches and a Hamiltonian system.

Boolean Models of Bistable Biological Systems,"Franziska Hinkelmann, Reinhard Laubenbacher","This paper presents an algorithm for approximating certain types of dynamical systems given by a system of ordinary delay differential equations by a Boolean network model. Often Boolean models are much simpler to understand than complex differential equations models. The motivation for this work comes from mathematical systems biology. While Boolean mechanisms do not provide information about exact concentration rates or time scales, they are often sufficient to capture steady states and other key dynamics. Due to their intuitive nature, such models are very appealing to researchers in the life sciences. This paper is focused on dynamical systems that exhibit bistability and are desc ribedby delay equations. It is shown that if a certain motif including a feedback loop is present in the wiring diagram of the system, the Boolean model captures the bistability of molecular switches.

Next, we use the construction in this proof to get other undecidability results, e.g., for the accessibility of a transition in a FIS, or for the finiteness of the language recognized by a FIS. Finally, we present a simple proof of the equivalence between FISs and tile systems, making explicit that they precisely capture recognizable two-dimensional languages.",2009-12-31T15:19:39Z,2009-12-31T15:19:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0143v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.0143v1,"cs.FL, cs.PL, F.1.2; D.1.3"

Perceiving the Social: A Multi-Agent System to Support Human Navigation   in Foreign Communities,"Victor V. Kryssanov, Shizuka Kumokawa, Igor Goncharenko, Hitoshi Ogawa","This paper describes a system developed to help people explore local communities by providing navigation services in social spaces created by the community members via communication and knowledge sharing. The proposed system utilizes data of a community's social network to reconstruct the social space, which is otherwise not physically perceptible but imaginary, experiential, yet learnable. The social space is modeled with an agent network, where each agent stands for a member of the community and has knowledge about expertise and personal characteristics of some other members. An agent can gather information, using its social ""connections"", to find community members most suitable to communicate to in a specific situation defined by the system's user. The system then deploys its multimodal interface, which ""maps"" the social space onto a representation of the relevant physical space, to locate the potential interlocutors and advise the user on an efficient communication strategy for the given community.",2010-03-19T03:55:48Z,2010-03-19T03:55:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3708v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3708v1,"cs.CY, cs.HC, H.5.1; K.4.2; H.4.2; H.5.2"
Modeling and Reasoning over Distributed Systems using Aspect-Oriented   Graph Grammars,"Rodrigo Machado, Reiko Heckel, Leila Ribeiro","Aspect-orientation is a relatively new paradigm that introduces abstractions to modularize the implementation of system-wide policies. It is based on a composition operation, called aspect weaving, that implicitly modifies a base system by performing related changes within the system modules. Aspect-oriented graph grammars (AOGG) extend the classic graph grammar formalism by defining aspects as sets of rule-based modifications over a base graph grammar. Despite the advantages of aspect-oriented concepts regarding modularity, the implicit nature of the aspect weaving operation may also introduce issues when reasoning about the system behavior. Since in AOGGs aspect weaving is characterized by means of rule-based rewriting, we can overcome these problems by using known analysis techniques from the graph transformation literature to study aspect composition. In this paper, we present a case study of a distributed client-server system with global policies, modeled as an aspect-oriented graph grammar, and discuss how to use the AGG tool to identify potential conflicts in aspect weaving.",2010-03-22T07:18:30Z,2010-03-22T07:18:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4090v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.4090v1,"cs.LO, cs.PL, cs.SE"
Integrated symbolic control design for nonlinear systems with infinite   states specifications,"Giordano Pola, Alessandro Borri, Maria D.

In this paper we give a further contribution to this research line, by addressing the problem of symbolic control design of nonlinear systems with infinite states specifications, modelled by differential equations. We first derive the symbolic controller solving the control design problem, given in terms of discrete abstractions of the plant and the specification systems. We then present an algorithm which integrates the construction of the discrete abstractions with the design of the symbolic controller.

Tracing Properties of UML and OCL Models with Maude,"Francisco Durán, Martin Gogolla, Manuel Roldán","The starting point of this paper is a system described in form of a UML class diagram where system states are characterized by OCL invariants and system transitions are defined by OCL pre- and postconditions.

Robust Stackelberg game in communication systems,"saeedeh parsaeefard, Mihaela van der Schaar, Ahmad R. Sharafat","This paper studies multi-user communication systems with two groups of users: leaders which possess system information, and followers which have no system information using the formulation of Stackelberg games. In such games, the leaders play and choose their actions based on their information about the system and the followers choose their actions myopically according to their observations of the aggregate impact of other users. However, obtaining the exact value of these parameters is not practical in communication systems. To study the effect of uncertainty and preserve the players' utilities in these conditions, we introduce a robust equilibrium for Stackelberg games. In this framework, the leaders' information and the followers' observations are uncertain parameters, and the leaders and the followers choose their actions by solving the worst-case robust optimizations. We show that the followers' uncertain parameters always increase the leaders' utilities and decrease the followers' utilities. Conversely, the leaders' uncertain information reduces the leaders' utilities and increases the followers' utilities. We illustrate our theoretical results with the numerical results obtained based on the power control games in the interference channels.",2011-08-25T07:16:34Z,2011-08-25T07:16:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5025v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.5025v1,"cs.IT, cs.GT, math.IT"

A Dynamic Framework of Reputation Systems for an Agent Mediated e-market,"Vibha Gaur, Neeraj Kumar Sharma",The success of an agent mediated e-market system lies in the underlying reputation management system to improve the quality of services in an information asymmetric e-market. Reputation provides an operatable metric for establishing trustworthiness between mutually unknown online entities. Reputation systems encourage honest behaviour and discourage malicious behaviour of participating agents in the e-market. A dynamic reputation model would provide virtually instantaneous knowledge about the changing e-market environment and would utilise Internets' capacity for continuous interactivity for reputation computation. This paper proposes a dynamic reputation framework using reinforcement learning and fuzzy set theory that ensures judicious use of information sharing for inter-agent cooperation. This framework is sensitive to the changing parameters of e-market like the value of transaction and the varying experience of agents with the purpose of improving inbuilt defense mechanism of the reputation system against various attacks so that e-market reaches an equilibrium state and dishonest agents are weeded out of the market.,2011-10-18T12:50:26Z,2011-10-18T12:50:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3961v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.3961v1,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.IT, cs.SI, math.IT"

Information storage capacity of discrete spin systems,Beni Yoshida,"Understanding the limits imposed on information storage capacity of physical systems is a problem of fundamental and practical importance which bridges physics and information science. There is a well-known upper bound on the amount of information that can be stored reliably in a given volume of discrete spin systems which are supported by gapped local Hamiltonians. However, all the previously known systems were far below this theoretical bound, and it remained open whether there exists a gapped spin system that saturates this bound. Here, we present a construction of spin systems which saturate this theoretical limit asymptotically by borrowing an idea from fractal properties arising in the Sierpinski triangle. Our construction provides not only the best classical error-correcting code which is physically realizable as the energy ground space of gapped frustration-free Hamiltonians, but also a new research avenue for correlated spin phases with fractal spin configurations.",2011-11-14T16:37:26Z,2012-12-24T22:57:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3275v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.3275v3,"cs.IT, cond-mat.str-el, math-ph, math.IT, math.MP, nlin.CG, quant-ph"

Productivity of Non-Orthogonal Term Rewrite Systems,Matthias Raffelsieper,"Productivity is the property that finite prefixes of an infinite constructor term can be computed using a given term rewrite system.

This paper presents techniques to also prove productivity of non-orthogonal term rewrite systems. For such systems, it is desired that one does not have to guess the reduction steps to perform, instead any outermost-fair reduction should compute an infinite constructor term in the limit. As a main result, it is shown that for possibly non-orthogonal term rewrite systems this kind of productivity can be concluded from context-sensitive termination.

Thereafter a generalized minimal model spin-Hamiltonian is constructed for the low-dimensional system. Solution of this model Hamiltonian within first order perturbation theory results into the evaluation of spin-gap in the spin-tetramer system. In addition, the effects of size-confinement and volume reduction on the relevant exchange integrals and spin-gap of the low-dimensional system are also discussed.",2012-07-06T06:13:15Z,2012-07-06T06:13:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1529v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.1529v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Artificial Neural Network Based Prediction of Optimal Pseudo-Damping and   Meta-Damping in Oscillatory Fractional Order Dynamical Systems,"Saptarshi Das, Indranil Pan, Khrist Sur, Shantanu Das","This paper investigates typical behaviors like damped oscillations in fractional order (FO) dynamical systems. Such response occurs due to the presence of, what is conceived as, pseudo-damping and meta-damping in some special class of FO systems. Here, approximation of such damped oscillation in FO systems with the conventional notion of integer order damping and time constant has been carried out using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Next, a multilayer feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been trained using the GA based results to predict the optimal pseudo and meta-damping from knowledge of the maximum order or number of terms in the FO dynamical system.",2012-08-01T18:54:07Z,2012-08-01T18:54:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0318v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0318v1,"cs.SY, cs.NE"
Performance of MIMO Relay DCSK-CD Systems over Nakagami Fading Channels,"Yi Fang, Jing Xu, Lin Wang, Guanrong Chen","A multi-access multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay differential chaos shift keying cooperative diversity (DCSK-CD) system is proposed in this paper as a comprehensive cooperation scheme, in which the relay and destination both employ multiple antennas to strengthen the robustness against signal fading in a wireless network. It is shown that, with spatial diversity gains, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system is remarkably better than the conventional DCSK non-cooperation (DCSK-NC) and DCSK cooperative communication (DCSK-CC) systems. Moreover, the exact BER and close-form expressions of the proposed system are derived over Nakagami fading channels through the moment generating function (MGF), which is shown to be highly consistent with the simulation results. Meanwhile, this paper illustrates a trade-off between the performance and the complexity, and provides a threshold for the number of relay antennas keeping the user consumed energy constant. Due to the above-mentioned advantages, the proposed system stands out as a good candidate or alternative for energy-constrained wireless communications based on chaotic modulation, especially for low-power and low-cost wireless personal area networks (WPANs).",2012-08-07T07:18:51Z,2012-08-07T07:18:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1350v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.1350v1,cs.OH
Out-of-equilibrium dynamics in systems with long-range interactions:   characterizing quasi-stationary states,Pierre de Buyl,Systems with long-range interactions (LRI) display unusual thermodynamical and dynamical properties that stem from the non-additive character of the interaction potential. We focus in this work on the lack of relaxation to thermal equilibrium when a LRI system is started out-of-equilibrium. Several attempts have been made at predicting the so-called quasi-stationary state (QSS) reached by the dynamics and at characterizing the resulting transition between magnetized and non-magnetized states. We review in this work recent theories and interpretations about the QSS. Several theories exist but none of them has provided yet a full account of the dynamics found in numerical simulations.,2012-10-23T18:09:44Z,2012-10-23T18:09:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6316v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6316v1,cond-mat.stat-mech
Fractal and Multifractal Scaling of Electrical Conduction in Random   Resistor Networks,S. Redner,"This article is a mini-review about electrical current flows in networks from the perspective of statistical physics. We briefly discuss analytical methods to solve the conductance of an arbitrary resistor network. We then turn to basic results related to percolation: namely, the conduction properties of a large random resistor network as the fraction of resistors is varied. We focus on how the conductance of such a network vanishes as the percolation threshold is approached from above. We also discuss the more microscopic current distribution within each resistor of a large network. At the percolation threshold, this distribution is multifractal in that all moments of this distribution have independent scaling properties. We will discuss the meaning of multifractal scaling and its implications for current flows in networks, especially the largest current in the network. Finally, we discuss the relation between resistor networks and random walks and show how the classic phenomena of recurrence and transience of random walks are simply related to the conductance of a corresponding electrical network.",2007-10-04T21:40:43Z,2007-10-04T21:40:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1105v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.1105v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.class-ph"
A model of quantum-like decision-making with applications to psychology   and cognitive science,Andrei Khrennikov,"We consider the following model of decision-making by cognitive systems. We present an algorithm -- quantum-like representation algorithm (QLRA) -- which provides a possibility to represent probabilistic data of any origin by complex probability amplitudes. Our conjecture is that cognitive systems developed the ability to use QLRA. They operate with complex probability amplitudes, mental wave functions. Since the mathematical formalism of QM describes as well (under some generalization) processing of such quantum-like (QL) mental states, the conventional quantum decision-making scheme can be used by the brain. We consider a modification of this scheme to describe decision-making in the presence of two ``incompatible'' mental variables. Such a QL decision-making can be used in situations like Prisoners Dilemma (PD) as well as others corresponding to so called disjunction effect in psychology and cognitive science.",2007-11-08T21:17:26Z,2007-11-08T21:17:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1366v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.1366v1,physics.gen-ph
Predicting relevant empty spots in social interaction,"Yoshiharu Maeno, Yukio Ohsawa","An empty spot refers to an empty hard-to-fill space which can be found in the records of the social interaction, and is the clue to the persons in the underlying social network who do not appear in the records. This contribution addresses a problem to predict relevant empty spots in social interaction. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks are studied as a model underlying the social interaction. A heuristic predictor function approach is presented as a new method to address the problem. Simulation experiment is demonstrated over a homogeneous network.

Epcast: Controlled Dissemination in Human-based Wireless Networks by   means of Epidemic Spreading Models,"Salvatore Scellato, Cecilia Mascolo, Mirco Musolesi, Vito Latora","Epidemics-inspired techniques have received huge attention in recent years from the distributed systems and networking communities. These algorithms and protocols rely on probabilistic message replication and redundancy to ensure reliable communication. Moreover, they have been successfully exploited to support group communication in distributed systems, broadcasting, multicasting and information dissemination in fixed and mobile networks. However, in most of the existing work, the probability of infection is determined heuristically, without relying on any analytical model. This often leads to unnecessarily high transmission overheads.   In this paper we show that models of epidemic spreading in complex networks can be applied to the problem of tuning and controlling the dissemination of information in wireless ad hoc networks composed of devices carried by individuals, i.e., human-based networks. The novelty of our idea resides in the evaluation and exploitation of the structure of the underlying human network for the automatic tuning of the dissemination process in order to improve the protocol performance. We evaluate the results using synthetic mobility models and real human contacts traces.",2007-11-18T09:29:19Z,2007-11-18T09:29:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2780v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.2780v1,cs.NI

Global dynamics of coupled standard maps,"T. Manos, Ch. Skokos, T. Bountis","Understanding the dynamics of multi--dimensional conservative dynamical systems (Hamiltonian flows or symplectic maps) is a fundamental issue of non-linear science. The Generalized ALignment Index (GALI), which was recently introduced and applied successfully for the distinction between regular and chaotic motion in Hamiltonian systems \cite{sk:6}, is an ideal tool for this purpose. In the present paper we make a first step towards the dynamical study of multi--dimensional maps, by obtaining some interesting results for a 4--dimensional (4D) symplectic map consisting of N=2 coupled standard maps \cite{Kan:1}. In particular, using the new GALI$_3$ and GALI$_4$ indices, we compute the percentages of regular and chaotic motion of the map equally reliably but much faster than previously used indices, like GALI$_2$ (known in the literature as SALI).",2008-01-25T12:02:38Z,2008-01-25T12:02:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3923v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3923v1,nlin.CD
Solar wind speed theory and the nonextensivity of solar corona,"Jiulin Du, Yeli Song","The solar corona is a complex system, with nonisothermal plasma and being in the self-gravitating field of the Sun. So the corona plasma is not only a nonequilibrium system but also a nonextensive one. We estimate the parameter of describing the degree of nonextensivity of the corona plasma and study the generalization of the solar wind speed theory in the framework of nonextensive statistical mechanics. It is found that, when use Chapman's corona model (1957) as the radial distribution of the temperature in the corona, the nonextensivity reduces the gas pressure outward and thus leads a significant deceleration effect on the radial speed of the solar wind.",2008-02-15T10:32:56Z,2008-02-15T10:32:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2170v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.2170v1,"astro-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.space-ph"

We will discuss the aspects of control theory, which are the most useful in applications to the real problems of quantum optics. We apply this technique to control the behavior of the two-level quantum particles (atoms) in the modulated external optical field in the frame of the so called ""semi classical model"", where quantum two-level atomic system (all other levels are neglected) interacts with classical electromagnetic field. In this paper we propose a simple model of feedforward (open-loop) control for the quantum particle system, which is a basement for further investigation of two-level quantum particle in the external one-dimensional optical field.",2008-02-21T13:56:07Z,2008-02-21T13:56:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3114v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3114v1,physics.optics
Approximating a Behavioural Pseudometric without Discount for<br>   Probabilistic Systems,"Franck van Breugel, Babita Sharma, James Worrell","Desharnais, Gupta, Jagadeesan and Panangaden introduced a family of behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic transition systems. These pseudometrics are a quantitative analogue of probabilistic bisimilarity. Distance zero captures probabilistic bisimilarity. Each pseudometric has a discount factor, a real number in the interval (0, 1]. The smaller the discount factor, the more the future is discounted. If the discount factor is one, then the future is not discounted at all. Desharnais et al. showed that the behavioural distances can be calculated up to any desired degree of accuracy if the discount factor is smaller than one. In this paper, we show that the distances can also be approximated if the future is not discounted. A key ingredient of our algorithm is Tarski's decision procedure for the first order theory over real closed fields. By exploiting the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theorem we can restrict to the existential fragment for which more efficient decision procedures exist.",2008-03-26T19:08:40Z,2008-04-09T14:23:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3796v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3796v3,"cs.LO, F.3.1; F.3.2"
Practical Automated Partial Verification of Multi-Paradigm Real-Time   Models,"Carlo A. Furia, Matteo Pradella, Matteo Rossi","This article introduces a fully automated verification technique that permits to analyze real-time systems described using a continuous notion of time and a mixture of operational (i.e., automata-based) and descriptive (i.e., logic-based) formalisms. The technique relies on the reduction, under reasonable assumptions, of the continuous-time verification problem to its discrete-time counterpart. This reconciles in a viable and effective way the dense/discrete and operational/descriptive dichotomies that are often encountered in practice when it comes to specifying and analyzing complex critical systems. The article investigates the applicability of the technique through a significant example centered on a communication protocol. More precisely, concurrent runs of the protocol are formalized by parallel instances of a Timed Automaton, while the synchronization rules between these instances are specified through Metric Temporal Logic formulas, thus creating a multi-paradigm model. Verification tests run on this model using a bounded validity checker implementing the technique show consistent results and interesting performances.",2008-04-28T12:04:12Z,2008-07-04T14:42:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4383v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.4383v2,cs.LO
Enriched MU-Calculi Module Checking,"Alessandro Ferrante, Aniello Murano, Mimmo Parente","The model checking problem for open systems has been intensively studied in the literature, for both finite-state (module checking) and infinite-state (pushdown module checking) systems, with respect to Ctl and Ctl*. In this paper, we further investigate this problem with respect to the \mu-calculus enriched with nominals and graded modalities (hybrid graded Mu-calculus), in both the finite-state and infinite-state settings. Using an automata-theoretic approach, we show that hybrid graded \mu-calculus module checking is solvable in exponential time, while hybrid graded \mu-calculus pushdown module checking is solvable in double-exponential time. These results are also tight since they match the known lower bounds for Ctl. We also investigate the module checking problem with respect to the hybrid graded \mu-calculus enriched with inverse programs (Fully enriched \mu-calculus): by showing a reduction from the domino problem, we show its undecidability. We conclude with a short overview of the model checking problem for the Fully enriched Mu-calculus and the fragments obtained by dropping at least one of the additional constructs.",2008-05-22T13:29:44Z,2008-07-29T21:53:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3462v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3462v2,"cs.LO, F.1.1; F.1.2; F.3.1; D.2.4"

Recently a number of publications successfully applied the analysis of residue networks to predict active centres in proteins. Most real-world networks show a number of properties, such as small-worldness or scale-free degree distribution, which are rather general features of networks, from molecules to society at large. Using analogy I propose that existing findings and methodology already enable us to detect active centres in cells, and can be expanded to social networks and ecosystems. Members of these active centres are termed here as creative elements of their respective networks, which may help them to survive unprecedented, novel challenges, and play a key role in the development, survival and evolvability of complex systems.",2008-07-02T09:42:40Z,2008-11-27T17:42:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0308v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0308v4,"q-bio.MN, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.BM"

Examples of shapely function definitions may be implementations of matrix multiplication and the Cartesian product of two lists. The type system is proved to be sound w.r.t. the operational semantics of the language. The type checking problem is shown to be undecidable in general. We define a natural syntactic restriction such that the type checking becomes decidable, even though size polynomials are not necessarily linear or monotonic.

Building effective models from sparse but precise data,"Eric Cockayne, Axel van de Walle","A common approach in computational science is to use a set of of highly precise but expensive calculations to parameterize a model that allows less precise, but more rapid calculations on larger scale systems. Least-squares fitting on a model that underfits the data is generally used for this purpose. For arbitrarily precise data free from statistic noise, e.g. ab initio calculations, we argue that it is more appropriate to begin with a ensemble of models that overfit the data. Within a Bayesian framework, a most likely model can be defined that incorporates physical knowledge, provides error estimates for systems not included in the fit, and reproduces the original data exactly. We apply this approach to obtain a cluster expansion model for the Ca[Zr,Ti]O3 solid solution.",2009-08-05T19:39:47Z,2009-08-05T19:39:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0659v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0659v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Neutron halo in deformed nuclei,"Shan-Gui Zhou, Jie Meng, P. Ring, En-Guang Zhao","Halo phenomena in deformed nuclei are investigated within a deformed relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov (DRHB) theory. These weakly bound quantum systems present interesting examples for the study of the interdependence between the deformation of the core and the particles in the halo. Contributions of the halo, deformation effects, and large spatial extensions of these systems are described in a fully self-consistent way by the DRHB equations in a spherical Woods-Saxon basis with the proper asymptotic behavior at large distance from the nuclear center. Magnesium and neon isotopes are studied and detailed results are presented for the deformed neutron-rich and weakly bound nucleus $^{44}$Mg. The core of this nucleus is prolate, but the halo has a slightly oblate shape. This indicates a decoupling of the halo orbitals from the deformation of the core. The generic conditions for the occurence of this decoupling effects are discussed.",2009-09-09T00:49:33Z,2010-06-07T16:56:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1600v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.1600v3,nucl-th

The Complexity of Infinite Computations In Models of Set Theory,Olivier Finkel,"We prove the following surprising result: there exist a 1-counter B\""uchi automaton and a 2-tape B\""uchi automaton such that the \omega-language of the first and the infinitary rational relation of the second in one model of ZFC are \pi_2^0-sets, while in a different model of ZFC both are analytic but non Borel sets.   This shows that the topological complexity of an \omega-language accepted by a 1-counter B\""uchi automaton or of an infinitary rational relation accepted by a 2-tape B\""uchi automaton is not determined by the axiomatic system ZFC.

DAMQ-Based Schemes for Efficiently Using the Buffer Spaces of a NoC   Router,"Mohammad Ali Jabraeil Jamali, Ahmad Khademzadeh","In this paper we present high performance dynamically allocated multi-queue (DAMQ) buffer schemes for fault tolerance systems on chip applications that require an interconnection network. Two or four virtual channels shared the same buffer space. On the message switching layer, we make improvement to boost system performance when there are faults involved in the components communication. The proposed schemes are when a node or a physical channel is deemed as faulty, the previous hop node will terminate the buffer occupancy of messages destined to the failed link. The buffer usage decisions are made at switching layer without interactions with higher abstract layer, thus buffer space will be released to messages destined to other healthy nodes quickly. Therefore, the buffer space will be efficiently used in case fault occurs at some nodes.",2009-10-09T20:24:57Z,2009-10-09T20:24:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1852v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.1852v1,cs.DC

Abstract Interpretation for Probabilistic Termination of Biological   Systems,"Roberta Gori, Francesca Levi","In a previous paper the authors applied the Abstract Interpretation approach for approximating the probabilistic semantics of biological systems, modeled specifically using the Chemical Ground Form calculus. The methodology is based on the idea of representing a set of experiments, which differ only for the initial concentrations, by abstracting the multiplicity of reagents present in a solution, using intervals. In this paper, we refine the approach in order to address probabilistic termination properties. More in details, we introduce a refinement of the abstract LTS semantics and we abstract the probabilistic semantics using a variant of Interval Markov Chains. The abstract probabilistic model safely approximates a set of concrete experiments and reports conservative lower and upper bounds for probabilistic termination.",2009-11-26T00:36:03Z,2009-11-26T00:36:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4988v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.4988v1,"cs.LO, cs.CE, cs.FL, q-bio.QM"

Starting with Shannons communication model and ending with the OSI model, this paper presents progressively more advanced forms of modeling of communication systems by tying communication models together based on the notion of flow. The basic communication process is divided into different spheres (sources, channels, and destinations), each with its own five interior stages, receiving, processing, creating, releasing, and transferring of information.

Anderson localization casts clouds over adiabatic quantum optimization,"Boris Altshuler, Hari Krovi, Jeremie Roland","Understanding NP-complete problems is a central topic in computer science. This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer's Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: the system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.",2009-12-03T22:31:36Z,2009-12-03T22:31:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0746v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.0746v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cs.CC"

Fractal Heterogeneous Media,"Christian Turk, Anna Carbone, Bernardino M. Chiaia","A method is proposed for generating compact fractal disordered media, by generalizing the random midpoint displacement algorithm. The obtained structures are invasive stochastic fractals, with the Hurst exponent varying as a continuous parameter, as opposed to lacunar deterministic fractals, such as the Menger sponge. By employing the Detrending Moving Average algorithm [Phys. Rev. E 76, 056703 (2007)], the Hurst exponent of the generated structure can be subsequently checked. The fractality of such a structure is referred to a property defined over a three dimensional topology rather than to the topology itself. Consequently, in this framework, the Hurst exponent should be intended as an estimator of compactness rather than of roughness. Applications can be envisaged for simulating and quantifying complex systems characterized by self-similar heterogeneity across space. For example, exploitation areas range from the design and control of multifunctional self-assembled artificial nano and micro structures, to the analysis and modelling of complex pattern formation in biology, environmental sciences, geomorphological sciences, etc.",2009-12-07T22:27:55Z,2009-12-07T22:27:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1362v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.1362v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.dis-nn"

Computation Tree Logic with Deadlock Detection,"Rob van Glabbeek, Bas Luttik, Nikola Trcka","We study the equivalence relation on states of labelled transition systems of satisfying the same formulas in Computation Tree Logic without the next state modality (CTL-X). This relation is obtained by De Nicola & Vaandrager by translating labelled transition systems to Kripke structures, while lifting the totality restriction on the latter. They characterised it as divergence sensitive branching bisimulation equivalence.   We find that this equivalence fails to be a congruence for interleaving parallel composition. The reason is that the proposed application of CTL-X to non-total Kripke structures lacks the expressiveness to cope with deadlock properties that are important in the context of parallel composition. We propose an extension of CTL-X, or an alternative treatment of non-totality, that fills this hiatus. The equivalence induced by our extension is characterised as branching bisimulation equivalence with explicit divergence, which is, moreover, shown to be the coarsest congruence contained in divergence sensitive branching bisimulation equivalence.",2009-12-10T21:20:20Z,2009-12-22T08:32:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2109v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.2109v2,"cs.LO, F.4.1; D.2.4"

We find that accumulative trading volume gradually emerges a kurtosis near the price mean value over a trading price range when it takes a longer trading time, regardless of actual price fluctuation path, time series, or total transaction volume in the time interval. To explain the volume-price behavior, we, in terms of physics, propose a transaction energy hypothesis, derive a time-independent transaction volume-price probability wave equation, and get two sets of analytical volume distribution eigenfunctions over a trading price range. By empiric test, we show the existence of coherence in stock market and demonstrate the model validation at this early stage.

The Sparsity Gap: Uncertainty Principles Proportional to Dimension,Joel A. Tropp,"In an incoherent dictionary, most signals that admit a sparse representation admit a unique sparse representation. In other words, there is no way to express the signal without using strictly more atoms. This work demonstrates that sparse signals typically enjoy a higher privilege: each nonoptimal representation of the signal requires far more atoms than the sparsest representation-unless it contains many of the same atoms as the sparsest representation. One impact of this finding is to confer a certain degree of legitimacy on the particular atoms that appear in a sparse representation. This result can also be viewed as an uncertainty principle for random sparse signals over an incoherent dictionary.",2010-03-01T18:28:33Z,2010-03-01T18:28:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0415v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0415v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"

Using data from the XMM-Newton satellite, we show that the X-ray pulsator RX J0648.0-4418 is a white dwarf with mass > 1.2 Msun, based only on dynamical measurements. This ultra-massive white dwarf in a post-common envelope binary with a hot subdwarf can reach the Chandrasekhar limit, and possibly explode as a Type Ia supernova, when its helium-rich companion will transfer mass at an increased rate through Roche lobe overflow.",2010-03-04T09:41:58Z,2010-03-04T09:41:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0997v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0997v1,"astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR"
Energy Transfer from Individual Semiconductor Nanocrystals to Graphene,"Zheyuan Chen, Stéphane Berciaud, Colin Nuckolls, Tony F. Heinz, Louis E.

A situation of particular interest concerns the interaction between a photoexcited dipole and an atomically thin metal. The recent discovery of graphene layers permits investigation of this phenomenon. Here we report a study of fluorescence from individual CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals in contact with single- and few-layer graphene sheets. The rate of energy transfer is determined from the strong quenching of the nanocrystal fluorescence. For single-layer graphene, we find a rate of ~ 4ns-1, in agreement with a model based on the dipole approximation and a tight-binding description of graphene. This rate increases significantly with the number of graphene layers, before approaching the bulk limit.

Multiple Conceptual Coherences in the Speed Tutorial: Micro-processes of   Local Stability,Brian W. Frank,"Researchers working within knowledge-in-pieces traditions have often employed observational approaches to investigate micro-processes of learning. There is growing evidence from this line of work that students' intuitive thinking about physical phenomena is characterized more so by its diversity and flexibility than its uniformity and robustness. This characterization implies that much of the dynamics of students' thinking over short timescales involve processes that stabilize local patterns of thinking, later destabilize them, and allow other patterns to form.

Wrapper/TAM Co-Optimization and constrained Test Scheduling for SOCs   Using Rectangle Bin Packing,"Hafiz Md. Hasan Babu, Md. Rafiqul Islam, Muhammad Rezaul Karim, Abdullah Al Mahmud, Md. Saiful Islam","This paper describes an integrated framework for SOC test automation. This framework is based on a new approach for Wrapper/TAM co-optimization based on rectangle packing considering the diagonal length of the rectangles to emphasize on both TAM widths required by a core and its corresponding testing time .In this paper, an efficient algorithm has been proposed to construct wrappers that reduce testing time for cores. Rectangle packing has been used to develop an integrated scheduling algorithm that incorporates power constraints in the test schedule.

The General Vector Addition System Reachability Problem by Presburger   Inductive Invariants,leroux jerome,"The reachability problem for Vector Addition Systems (VASs) is a central problem of net theory. The general problem is known to be decidable by algorithms exclusively based on the classical Kosaraju-Lambert-Mayr-Sacerdote-Tenney decomposition. This decomposition is used in this paper to prove that the Parikh images of languages recognized by VASs are semi-pseudo-linear; a class that extends the semi-linear sets, a.k.a. the sets definable in Presburger arithmetic. We provide an application of this result; we prove that a final configuration is not reachable from an initial one if and only if there exists a semi-linear inductive invariant that contains the initial configuration but not the final one. Since we can decide if a Presburger formula denotes an inductive invariant, we deduce that there exist checkable certificates of non-reachability. In particular, there exists a simple algorithm for deciding the general VAS reachability problem based on two semi-algorithms. A first one that tries to prove the reachability by enumerating finite sequences of actions and a second one that tries to prove the non-reachability by enumerating Presburger formulas.",2010-09-06T15:08:07Z,2010-09-09T12:48:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1076v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.1076v2,"cs.LO, F.1"
Approximate Modeling of Spherical Membrane,"Pekka Koskinen, Oleg O. Kit","Spherical symmetry is ubiquitous in nature. It's therefore unfortunate that spherical system simulations are so hard, and require complete spheres with millions of interacting particles. Here we introduce an approach to model spherical systems, using revised periodic boundary conditions adapted to spherical symmetry. Method reduces computational costs by orders of magnitude, and is applicable for both solid and liquid membranes, provided the curvature is sufficiently small. We demonstrate the method by calculating the bending and Gaussian curvature moduli of single- and multi-layer graphene. Method works with any interaction (ab initio, classical interactions), with any approach (molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo), and with applications ranging from science to engineering, from liquid to solid membranes, from bubbles to balloons.",2010-10-01T05:44:59Z,2010-11-23T10:37:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0067v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.0067v2,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Categorical Quantum Circuits,"Ville Bergholm, Jacob D. Biamonte","In this paper, we extend past work done on the application of the mathematics of category theory to quantum information science. Specifically, we present a realization of a dagger-compact category that can model finite-dimensional quantum systems and explicitly allows for the interaction of systems of arbitrary, possibly unequal, dimensions. Hence our framework can handle generic tensor network states, including matrix product states. Our categorical model subsumes the traditional quantum circuit model while remaining directly and easily applicable to problems stated in the language of quantum information science. The circuit diagrams themselves now become morphisms in a category, making quantum circuits a special case of a much more general mathematical framework. We introduce the key algebraic properties of our tensor calculus diagrammatically and show how they can be applied to solve problems in the field of quantum information.",2010-10-23T02:15:12Z,2011-05-29T15:00:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4840v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4840v2,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"

This is because they arise in the procedure known as {\em Normal ordering} of bosons, a procedure which is involved in the evaluation of quantum functions such as the canonical partition function of quantum statistical physics, {\it inter alia}. In fact, we shall show that an evaluation of the non-interacting partition function for a single boson system is identical to integrating the {\em exponential generating function} of the Bell numbers, which is a device for encapsulating a combinatorial sequence in a single function. We then introduce a remarkable equality, the Dobinski relation, and use it to indicate why renormalisation is necessary in even the simplest of perturbation expansions for a partition function.

Automata and temporal logic over arbitrary linear time,Julien Cristau,"Linear temporal logic was introduced in order to reason about reactive systems. It is often considered with respect to infinite words, to specify the behaviour of long-running systems. One can consider more general models for linear time, using words indexed by arbitrary linear orderings. We investigate the connections between temporal logic and automata on linear orderings, as introduced by Bruy\`ere and Carton. We provide a doubly exponential procedure to compute from any LTL formula with Until, Since, and the Stavi connectives an automaton that decides whether that formula holds on the input word. In particular, since the emptiness problem for these automata is decidable, this transformation gives a decision procedure for the satisfiability of the logic.",2011-01-10T08:53:11Z,2011-01-10T08:53:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1731v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.1731v1,"cs.LO, cs.FL"
Synthesis of Memory-Efficient Real-Time Controllers for Safety   Objectives (Full Version),"Krishnendu Chatterjee, Vinayak S. Prabhu","We study synthesis of controllers for real-time systems, where the objective is to stay in a given safe set. The problem is solved by obtaining winning strategies in concurrent two-player \emph{timed automaton games} with safety objectives. To prevent a player from winning by blocking time, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannot be responsible for causing a zeno run. We construct winning strategies for the controller which require access only to (1) the system clocks (thus, controllers which require their own internal infinitely precise clocks are not necessary), and (2) a linear (in the number of clocks) number of memory bits. Precisely, we show that a memory of size $\big(3\cdot|C|+1 + \lg(|C|+1)\big)$ bits suffices for winning controller strategies for safety objectives, where $C$ is the set of clocks of the timed automaton game, significantly improving the previous known exponential bound. We also settle the open question of whether \emph{region} strategies for controllers require memory for safety objectives by showing with an example that region strategies do require memory for safety objectives.",2011-01-31T02:51:14Z,2011-01-31T02:51:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5842v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.5842v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT"

Ground-based radial velocity orbits combined with satellite data from Hubble, FUSE, IUE, and Chandra can provide full information about the systems, including the masses.

Allo-network drugs: harnessing allostery in cellular networks,"Ruth Nussinov, Chung-Jung Tsai, Peter Csermely","Allosteric drugs are increasingly used because they produce fewer side effects. Allosteric signal propagation does not stop at the 'end' of a protein, but may be dynamically transmitted across the cell. Here, we propose that the concept of allosteric drugs can be broadened to allo-network drugs, whose effects can propagate either within a protein, or across several proteins, to enhance or inhibit specific interactions along a pathway. We posit that current allosteric drugs are a special case of allo-network drugs, and suggest that allo-network drugs can achieve specific, limited changes at the systems level, and in this way can achieve fewer side effects and lower toxicity.

A Generalized Kahn Principle for Abstract Asynchronous Networks,Samson Abramsky,"Our general motivation is to answer the question: ""What is a model of concurrent computation?"". As a preliminary exercise, we study dataflow networks. We develop a very general notion of model for asynchronous networks. The ""Kahn Principle"", which states that a network built from functional nodes is the least fixpoint of a system of equations associated with the network, has become a benchmark for the formal study of dataflow networks. We formulate a generalized version of the Kahn Principle, which applies to a large class of non-deterministic systems, in the setting of abstract asynchronous networks; and prove that the Kahn Principle holds under certain natural assumptions on the model. We also show that a class of models, which represent networks that compute over arbitrary event structures, generalizing dataflow networks which compute over streams, satisfy these assumptions.",2011-12-02T11:23:38Z,2011-12-02T11:23:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0427v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0427v1,"cs.LO, math.CT, quant-ph"

Using Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the encapsulation system with spherical particles as encapsulated guests, for different densities.

Evaluating the performance of geographical locations in scientific   networks with an aggregation - randomization - re-sampling approach (ARR),Stefan Hennemann,"Knowledge creation and dissemination in science and technology systems is perceived as a prerequisite for socio-economic development. The efficiency of creating new knowledge is considered to have a geographical component, i.e. some regions are more capable in scientific knowledge production than others. This article shows a method to use a network representation of scientific interaction to assess the relative efficiency of regions with diverse boundaries in channeling knowledge through a science system. In a first step, a weighted aggregate of the betweenness centrality is produced from empirical data (aggregation). The subsequent randomization of this empirical network produces the necessary Null-model for significance testing and normalization (randomization). This step is repeated to yield higher confidence about the results (re-sampling). The results are robust estimates for the relative regional efficiency to broker knowledge, which is discussed along with cross-sectional and longitudinal empirical examples. The network representation acts as a straight-forward metaphor of conceptual ideas from economic geography and neighboring disciplines. However, the procedure is not limited to centrality measures, nor is it limited to spatial aggregates.

Analytical Modelling of a Plucked Piezoelectric Bimorph for Energy   Harvesting,Michele Pozzi,"Energy harvesting (EH) is a multidisciplinary research area, involving physics, materials science and engineering, with the objective of providing renewable sources of sufficient power to operate targeted low-power applications. Piezoelectric transducers are often used for vibrational, inertial and direct movement EH. One problem is that, due to the stiffness of the most common material (PZT) and typically useful sizes, intrinsic resonant frequencies are normally high, whereas the available power is often concentrated at low frequencies. The aim of the plucking technique of frequency up-conversion, also known as ""pizzicato"" excitation, is to bridge this frequency gap. In this paper, the technique is modelled analytically. The analytical model is developed starting from the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations modified for piezoelectric coupling. A system of differential equations and associated initial conditions are derived which describe the free vibration of a piezoelectric bimorph in the last part of the plucking excitation, i.e. after release.

The firmware was written in Basic and compiled using Oshonsoft PIC IDE and downloaded to the microcontroller by using PICkit2 programmer. An application program was also developed using Visual Basic 6, which allows displaying the waveform of the signal(s) in real time and the data can be saved into the hard disk of the computer for future use and analysis. It can also be interfaced to the USB port of the PC or laptop using USB to serial adapter BAFO BF-810.

Spin transmission control in helical magnetic fields,"Henri Saarikoski, Tobias Dollinger, Klaus Richter","We calculate spin transport in two-dimensional waveguides in the presence of spatially modulated Zeeman-split energy bands. We show that in a regime where the spin evolution is predominantly adiabatic the spin backscattering rate can be tuned via diabatic Landau-Zener transitions between the spin-split bands [C. Betthausen et. al., Science 337, 324 (2012)]. This mechanism is tolerant against spin-independent scattering processes. Completely spin-polarized systems show full spin backscattering, and thus current switching. In partially spin-polarized systems a spatial sequence of Landau-Zener transition points enhances the resistance modulation via reoccupation of backscattered spin-polarized transport modes. We discuss a possible application as a spin transistor.",2012-07-23T14:19:26Z,2012-07-23T14:19:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5404v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5404v1,cond-mat.mes-hall
On Expressing and Monitoring Oscillatory Dynamics,"Petr Dluhoš, Luboš Brim, David Šafránek","To express temporal properties of dense-time real-valued signals, the Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has been defined by Maler et al. The work presented a monitoring algorithm deciding the satisfiability of STL formulae on finite discrete samples of continuous signals. The logic has been used to express and analyse biological systems, but it is not expressive enough to sufficiently distinguish oscillatory properties important in biology. In this paper we define the extended logic STL* in which STL is augmented with a signal-value freezing operator allowing us to express (and distinguish) detailed properties of biological oscillations. The logic is supported by a monitoring algorithm prototyped in Matlab. The monitoring procedure of STL* is evaluated on a biologically-relevant case study.",2012-08-19T16:01:35Z,2012-08-19T16:01:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3853v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.3853v1,"cs.CE, cs.LO, cs.NA, cs.SY"
Hybrid models of the cell cycle molecular machinery,"Vincent Noel, Dima Grigoriev, Sergei Vakulenko, Ovidiu Radulescu","Piecewise smooth hybrid systems, involving continuous and discrete variables, are suitable models for describing the multiscale regulatory machinery of the biological cells. In hybrid models, the discrete variables can switch on and off some molecular interactions, simulating cell progression through a series of functioning modes.

This computes the so-called clover of a state. When S is the completion of a WSTS X, the clover in S is a finite description of the downward closure of the reachability set. We show that such completions are infinity-complete exactly when X is an omega-2-WSTS, a new robust class of WSTS. We show that our procedure terminates in more cases than the generalized Karp-Miller procedure on extensions of Petri nets and on lossy channel systems. We characterize the WSTS where our procedure terminates as those that are clover-flattable.

Parameterised Multiparty Session Types,"Pierre-Malo Denielou, Nobuko Yoshida, Andi Bejleri, Raymond Hu","For many application-level distributed protocols and parallel algorithms, the set of participants, the number of messages or the interaction structure are only known at run-time. This paper proposes a dependent type theory for multiparty sessions which can statically guarantee type-safe, deadlock-free multiparty interactions among processes whose specifications are parameterised by indices. We use the primitive recursion operator from G\""odel's System T to express a wide range of communication patterns while keeping type checking decidable. To type individual distributed processes, a parameterised global type is projected onto a generic generator which represents a class of all possible end-point types. We prove the termination of the type-checking algorithm in the full system with both multiparty session types and recursive types. We illustrate our type theory through non-trivial programming and verification examples taken from parallel algorithms and Web services usecases.",2012-08-31T13:01:05Z,2012-10-10T09:07:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6483v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.6483v3,"cs.LO, F.3.3, D.1.3, F.1.1, F.1.2"

Efficient Instantiation of Parameterised Boolean Equation Systems to   Parity Games,"Gijs Kant, Jaco van de Pol","Parameterised Boolean Equation Systems (PBESs) are sequences of Boolean fixed point equations with data variables, used for, e.g., verification of modal mu-calculus formulae for process algebraic specifications with data.   Solving a PBES is usually done by instantiation to a Parity Game and then solving the game. Practical game solvers exist, but the instantiation step is the bottleneck.   We enhance the instantiation in two steps. First, we transform the PBES to a Parameterised Parity Game (PPG), a PBES with each equation either conjunctive or disjunctive. Then we use LTSmin, that offers transition caching, efficient storage of states and both distributed and symbolic state space generation, for generating the game graph. To that end we define a language module for LTSmin, consisting of an encoding of variables with parameters into state vectors, a grouped transition relation and a dependency matrix to indicate the dependencies between parts of the state vector and transition groups.   Benchmarks on some large case studies, show that the method speeds up the instantiation significantly and decreases memory usage drastically.",2012-10-24T00:33:20Z,2012-10-24T00:33:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6414v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6414v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT"

Equilibrium Points and Zero Velocity Surfaces in the Restricted Four   Body Problem with Solar Wind Drag,"Reena Kumari, Badam Singh Kushvah","We have analyzed the motion of an infinitesimal mass in the restricted four body problem with solar wind drag. It is assumed that forces which govern the motion are mutual gravitational attractions of the primaries, radiation pressure force and solar wind drag. We have derived the equations of motion and find the Jacobi integral, zero velocity surfaces and particular solutions of the system. It is found that three collinear points are real when radiation factor $0<\beta<0.1$ whereas only one real point obtained when $0.125<\beta<0.2$. Again, stability property of the system is examined with the help of Poincar\'{e} surface of section (PSS) and Lyapunov characteristic exponents (LCEs).

How jet physics scales from stellar black holes in GRBs to the supermassive ones in AGNs is still unknown. Here we show that jets produced by AGNs and GRBs exhibit the same correlation between the kinetic power carried by accelerated particles and the gamma-ray luminosity, with AGNs and GRBs lying at the low and high-luminosity ends, respectively, of the correlation. This result implies that the efficiency of energy dissipation in jets produced in black hole systems is similar over 10 orders of magnitude in jet power, establishing a physical analogy between AGN and GRBs.",2012-12-13T21:03:46Z,2013-01-03T15:51:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3343v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.3343v2,"astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO"
Formal Model-Driven Engineering: Generating Data and Behavioural   Components,"Chen-Wei Wang, Jim Davies","Model-driven engineering is the automatic production of software artefacts from abstract models of structure and functionality. By targeting a specific class of system, it is possible to automate aspects of the development process, using model transformations and code generators that encode domain knowledge and implementation strategies. Using this approach, questions of correctness for a complex, software system may be answered through analysis of abstract models of lower complexity, under the assumption that the transformations and generators employed are themselves correct. This paper shows how formal techniques can be used to establish the correctness of model transformations used in the generation of software components from precise object models. The source language is based upon existing, formal techniques; the target language is the widely-used SQL notation for database programming. Correctness is established by giving comparable, relational semantics to both languages, and checking that the transformations are semantics-preserving.",2013-01-01T01:54:57Z,2013-01-01T01:54:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0044v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.0044v1,"cs.SE, cs.LO, cs.MS, D.3.1; F.3.1"

Small planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune substantially outnumber Jupiter-sized planets. The survey measurements support the core accretion model in which planets form by the accumulation of solids and then gas in protoplanetary disks. The diversity of exoplanetary characteristics demonstrates that most of the gross features of the Solar system are one outcome in a continuum of possibilities.

Solving Parity Games on Integer Vectors,"Parosh Aziz Abdulla, Richard Mayr, Arnaud Sangnier, Jeremy Sproston","We consider parity games on infinite graphs where configurations are represented by control-states and integer vectors. This framework subsumes two classic game problems: parity games on vector addition systems with states (vass) and multidimensional energy parity games. We show that the multidimensional energy parity game problem is inter-reducible with a subclass of single-sided parity games on vass where just one player can modify the integer counters and the opponent can only change control-states. Our main result is that the minimal elements of the upward-closed winning set of these single-sided parity games on vass are computable. This implies that the Pareto frontier of the minimal initial credit needed to win multidimensional energy parity games is also computable, solving an open question from the literature. Moreover, our main result implies the decidability of weak simulation preorder/equivalence between finite-state systems and vass, and the decidability of model checking vass with a large fragment of the modal mu-calculus.",2013-06-12T12:52:01Z,2013-06-12T12:52:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2806v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2806v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT, 68Q60, D.2.2; D.2.4"
Satisfiability of ATL with strategy contexts,"François Laroussinie, Nicolas Markey","Various extensions of the temporal logic ATL have recently been introduced to express rich properties of multi-agent systems. Among these, ATLsc extends ATL with strategy contexts, while Strategy Logic has first-order quantification over strategies. There is a price to pay for the rich expressiveness of these logics: model-checking is non-elementary, and satisfiability is undecidable.   We prove in this paper that satisfiability is decidable in several special cases. The most important one is when restricting to turn-based games. We prove that decidability also holds for concurrent games if the number of moves available to the agents is bounded. Finally, we prove that restricting strategy quantification to memoryless strategies brings back undecidability.",2013-07-17T01:43:17Z,2013-07-17T01:43:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4478v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4478v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT, cs.MA"

Final coalgebra semantics then gives an interpretation function into the final coalgebra of all languages with the usual output and derivative operations. The first characterization is based on systems, where each derivative is given as a finite language over the set of nonterminals; the second characterization on systems where derivatives are given as elements of a term-algebra; and the third characterization is based on adding coalgebraic structure to a class of closed (unique) fixed point expressions.

Using higher-order contracts to model session types,"Giovanni Bernardi, Matthew Hennessy","Session types are used to describe and structure interactions between independent processes in distributed systems. Higher-order types are needed in order to properly structure delegation of responsibility between processes.   In this paper we show that higher-order web-service contracts can be used to provide a fully-abstract model of recursive higher-order session types. The model is set-theoretic, in the sense that the meaning of a contract is given in terms of the set of contracts with which it complies.   The proof of full-abstraction depends on a novel notion of the complement of a contract. This in turn gives rise to an alternative to the type duality commonly used in systems for type-checking session types. We believe that the notion of complement captures more faithfully the behavioural intuition underlying type duality.",2013-10-23T10:41:12Z,2016-06-28T18:48:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6176v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.6176v6,cs.LO

They are built from the alphabet, two kinds of traces, two kinds of divergence traces, five kinds of failures, and four kinds of infinite traces. In the case of finite LTSs, infinite traces lose their role and the number of congruences drops to 20.

And its sound and complete axiomatic system is naturally established. To model the outcomes of games (the co-action of the player and the opponent), correspondingly in GameACP, the execution of GameACP processes, another operator called playing operator (PO) is extended into GameACP. We also establish a sound and complete axiomatic system for PO.

Modular Complexity Analysis for Term Rewriting,"Harald Zankl, Martin Korp","All current investigations to analyze the derivational complexity of term rewrite systems are based on a single termination method, possibly preceded by transformations. However, the exclusive use of direct criteria is problematic due to their restricted power. To overcome this limitation the article introduces a modular framework which allows to infer (polynomial) upper bounds on the complexity of term rewrite systems by combining different criteria. Since the fundamental idea is based on relative rewriting, we study how matrix interpretations and match-bounds can be used and extended to measure complexity for relative rewriting, respectively. The modular framework is proved strictly more powerful than the conventional setting. Furthermore, the results have been implemented and experiments show significant gains in power.",2014-02-04T14:38:21Z,2014-03-29T16:55:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0746v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.0746v2,cs.LO
Numerical evidence for nucleated self-assembly of DNA brick structures,"Aleks Reinhardt, Daan Frenkel","The observation by Ke et al. [Science 338, 1177 (2012)] that large numbers of short, pre-designed DNA strands can assemble into three-dimensional target structures came as a great surprise, as no colloidal self-assembling system has ever achieved the same degree of complexity. That failure seemed easy to rationalise: the larger the number of distinct building blocks, the higher the expected error rate for self-assembly. The experiments of Ke et al. have disproved this argument. Here, we report Monte Carlo simulations of the self-assembly of a DNA brick cube, comprising approximately 1000 types of DNA strand, using a simple model. We model the DNA strands as lattice tetrahedra with attractive patches, the interaction strengths of which are computed using a standard thermodynamic model. We find that, within a narrow temperature window, the target structure assembles with high probability. Our simulations suggest that mis-assembly is disfavoured because of a slow nucleation step. As our model incorporates no aspect of DNA other than its binding properties, these simulations suggest that, with proper design of the building blocks, other systems, such as colloids, may also assemble into truly complex structures.",2014-02-25T16:33:02Z,2014-04-25T16:53:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6228v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6228v2,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.chem-ph"
Planets in Spin-Orbit Misalignment and the Search for Stellar Companions,"Brett C. Addison, C. G. Tinney, Duncan J. Wright, Graeme Salter, Daniel Bayliss, George Zhou","The discovery of giant planets orbiting close to their host stars was one of the most unexpected results of early exoplanetary science. Astronomers have since found that a significant fraction of these 'Hot Jupiters' move on orbits substantially misaligned with the rotation axis of their host star. We recently reported the measurement of the spin-orbit misalignment for WASP-79b by using data from the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope. Contemporary models of planetary formation produce planets on nearly coplanar orbits with respect to their host star's equator. We discuss the mechanisms which could drive planets into spin-orbit misalignment. The most commonly proposed being the Kozai mechanism, which requires the presence of a distant, massive companion to the star-planet system. We therefore describe a volume-limited direct-imaging survey of Hot Jupiter systems with measured spin-orbit angles, to search for the presence of stellar companions and test the Kozai hypothesis.",2014-03-04T01:35:14Z,2014-03-04T01:35:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0652v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.0652v1,astro-ph.EP
Interaction and Depth against Nondeterminism in Proof Search,Ozan Kahramanogullari,"Deep inference is a proof theoretic methodology that generalizes the standard notion of inference of the sequent calculus, whereby inference rules become applicable at any depth inside logical expressions. Deep inference provides more freedom in the design of deductive systems for different logics and a rich combinatoric analysis of proofs. In particular, construction of exponentially shorter analytic proofs becomes possible, however with the cost of a greater nondeterminism than in the sequent calculus. In this paper, we show that the nondeterminism in proof search can be reduced without losing the shorter proofs and without sacrificing proof theoretic cleanliness. For this, we exploit an interaction and depth scheme in the logical expressions. We demonstrate our method on deep inference systems for multiplicative linear logic and classical logic, discuss its proof complexity and its relation to focusing, and present implementations.",2014-03-11T16:22:34Z,2014-05-28T16:36:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2628v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2628v2,cs.LO
Infinitary Term Rewriting for Weakly Orthogonal Systems: Properties and   Counterexamples,"Joerg Endrullis, Clemens Grabmayer, Dimitri Hendriks, Jan Willem Klop, Vincent van Oostrom","We present some contributions to the theory of infinitary rewriting for weakly orthogonal term rewrite systems, in which critical pairs may occur provided they are trivial. We show that the infinitary unique normal form property fails by an example of a weakly orthogonal TRS with two collapsing rules. By translating this example, we show that this property also fails for the infinitary lambda-beta-eta-calculus. As positive results we obtain the following: Infinitary confluence, and hence the infinitary unique normal forms property, holds for weakly orthogonal TRSs that do not contain collapsing rules. To this end we refine the compression lemma. Furthermore, we establish the triangle and diamond properties for infinitary multi-steps (complete developments) in weakly orthogonal TRSs, by refining an earlier cluster-analysis for the finite case.",2014-03-24T22:25:36Z,2014-06-05T08:54:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6172v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6172v2,cs.LO
Companions of Stars: From Other Stars to Brown Dwarfs to Planets: The   Discovery of the First Methane Brown Dwarf,B. R.

The nature of companions of stars is discussed with an attempt to avoid biases induced by anthropocentric nomenclature. With the newer types of remote reconnaissance of nearby stars and their systems of companions, an exciting and perhaps even more profound set of contributions to science is within reach in the near future.

Investigation of fermionic pairing on tight binding lattice for low   dimensional systems,"Soumi Roy Chowdhury, Ranjan Chaudhury","Cooper's original one pair problem in continuum is revisited here corresponding to a lattice of tight binding nature, with an aim to investigate superconductivity in low dimensional systems. An electronic type of boson mediated attraction is considered for the pairing mechanism with the non trivial energy dependence of the electronic density of states taken into account in the calculation in a rigorous way. Some of the very important electronic and optical properties of a class of one dimensional organic conductors are used for the development of the formalism and calculation. The result of our calculations show that fermionic pair formation is indeed possible with some constraints. Similarities emerge in the physical properties of the electron pair formed from Cooper's treatment and ours excepting the striking difference appearing in the form of occurrence of a maximum allowed band filling for pairing and of an upper bound of the pairing energy found in our approach.",2014-04-21T08:05:40Z,2014-04-23T13:27:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5137v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5137v2,cond-mat.supr-con

Binary relations between magnitudes of different dimensions used in   material science optimization problems. Pseudo-state equation of Soft   Magnetic Composities,"Krzysztof Zdzisław Sokalski, Bartosz Jankowski, Barbara Ślusarek","Suplementary algoritm for optimizing technological parameters of soft magnetic compozities has been derived on the base of topological structure of the power loss characteristics. In optimization processes of magnitudes obeying scaling it happen binary relations of magnitudes having different dimensions. From mathematical point of view in general case such a procedure is not permissible. However, in a case of the system obeying the scaling law it is so. It has been shown that in such systems binary relations of magnitudes of different dimensions is correct and has mathematical meaning which is important for practical use of scaling in optimization processes. Derived here structure of the set of all power loss characteristics in soft magnetic composite enables us to derive a formal pseudo-state equation of SMC.

"Polynomial Interpretations over the Natural, Rational and Real Numbers   Revisited","Friedrich Neurauter, Aart Middeldorp","Polynomial interpretations are a useful technique for proving termination of term rewrite systems. They come in various flavors: polynomial interpretations with real, rational and integer coefficients. As to their relationship with respect to termination proving power, Lucas managed to prove in 2006 that there are rewrite systems that can be shown polynomially terminating by polynomial interpretations with real (algebraic) coefficients, but cannot be shown polynomially terminating using polynomials with rational coefficients only. He also proved the corresponding statement regarding the use of rational coefficients versus integer coefficients. In this article we extend these results, thereby giving the full picture of the relationship between the aforementioned variants of polynomial interpretations. In particular, we show that polynomial interpretations with real or rational coefficients do not subsume polynomial interpretations with integer coefficients. Our results hold also for incremental termination proofs with polynomial interpretations.",2014-07-01T20:32:24Z,2014-09-16T21:38:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0406v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.0406v2,cs.LO
Topological Similarity of Random Cell Complexes and Applications,"Benjamin Schweinhart, Jeremy Mason, Robert MacPherson","Although random cell complexes occur throughout the physical sciences, there does not appear to be a standard way to quantify their statistical similarities and differences. The various proposals in the literature are usually motivated by the analysis of particular physical systems and do not necessarily apply to general situations. The central concepts in this paper---the swatch and the cloth---provide a description of the local topology of a cell complex that is general (any physical system that may be represented as a cell complex is admissible) and complete (any statistical question about the local topology may be answered from the cloth). Furthermore, this approach allows a distance to be defined that measures the similarity of the local topology of two cell complexes. The distance is used to identify a steady state of a model dislocation network evolving by energy minimization, and then to rigorously quantify the approach of the simulation to this steady state.",2014-07-25T17:52:41Z,2016-01-04T22:23:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6989v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.6989v2,"cs.CG, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Generating and Solving Symbolic Parity Games,"Gijs Kant, Jaco van de Pol","We present a new tool for verification of modal mu-calculus formulae for process specifications, based on symbolic parity games. It enhances an existing method, that first encodes the problem to a Parameterised Boolean Equation System (PBES) and then instantiates the PBES to a parity game. We improved the translation from specification to PBES to preserve the structure of the specification in the PBES, we extended LTSmin to instantiate PBESs to symbolic parity games, and implemented the recursive parity game solving algorithm by Zielonka for symbolic parity games. We use Multi-valued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) to represent sets and relations, thus enabling the tools to deal with very large systems. The transition relation is partitioned based on the structure of the specification, which allows for efficient manipulation of the MDDs. We performed two case studies on modular specifications, that demonstrate that the new method has better time and memory performance than existing PBES based tools and can be faster (but slightly less memory efficient) than the symbolic model checker NuSMV.",2014-07-30T03:22:32Z,2014-07-30T03:22:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7928v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7928v1,"cs.LO, cs.GT"

Factors Affecting QoS in Tanzania Cellular Networks,"Adam B. Mtaho, Fredrick Romanus Ishengoma","Quality of service in cellular communication system is a topic that recently has raised much interest for many researchers. This paper presents the findings obtained from the study on factors affecting QoS in Tanzania cellular networks. The study was carried out in Dodoma Municipal, Tanzania. The study employed cross sectional research design. Information was gathered from structured questionnaire of 240 subscribers during the study of quality of service for the four leading cellular networks in Tanzania. Both qualitative and quantitative data from field survey were collected and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences and Excel software. The study findings show that the major factors that degrade QoS in Tanzania cellular networks are inadequate network infrastructure, lack of fairness from service providers and little efforts taken by the government in enforcing the national agreed standards. Other factors are lack of reliable end to end systems, geographical terrain, low quality handsets, poor government monitoring on standards and lack of subscriber skills and training.",2014-10-02T12:52:52Z,2014-10-02T12:52:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0533v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0533v1,cs.CY

Band 5 observations with SKA-MID towards cluster surveys from the next generation of X-ray telescopes such as e-ROSITA and from Euclid will provide the robust mass estimates required to exploit these samples.

Fibred Coalgebraic Logic and Quantum Protocols,Daniel Marsden,"Motivated by applications in modelling quantum systems using coalgebraic techniques, we introduce a fibred coalgebraic logic. Our approach extends the conventional predicate lifting semantics with additional modalities relating conditions on different fibres. As this fibred setting will typically involve multiple signature functors, the logic incorporates a calculus of modalities enabling the construction of new modalities using various composition operations. We extend the semantics of coalgebraic logic to this setting, and prove that this extension respects behavioural equivalence.   We show how properties of the semantics of modalities are preserved under composition operations, and then apply the calculational aspect of our logic to produce an expressive set of modalities for reasoning about quantum systems, building these modalities up from simpler components. We then demonstrate how these modalities can describe some standard quantum protocols. The novel features of our logic are shown to allow for a uniform description of unitary evolution, and support local reasoning such as ""Alice's qubit satisfies condition"" as is common when discussing quantum protocols.",2014-12-30T01:43:13Z,2014-12-30T01:43:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8525v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8525v1,"quant-ph, cs.LO, F.4.1"

Among them, a family of scanning probe microscopy methods (STM, AFM, KPFM) and the corresponding spectroscopy add-ons provide information about the structure and electronic properties of graphene on the local scale (from inline imagem to atoms). This review focuses on the recent applications of these microscopic/spectroscopic methods for the investigation of graphene on metals (interfaces, intercalation-like systems, graphene nanoribbons, and quantum dots, etc.). It is shown that very important information about interaction strength at the graphene/metal interfaces as well as about modification of the electronic spectrum of graphene at the Fermi level can be obtained on the local scale. The combination of these results with those obtained by other methods and comparison with recent theoretical data demonstrate the power of this approach for the investigation of the graphene-based systems.",2015-02-02T09:13:34Z,2015-02-02T09:13:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00411v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.00411v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall"
Variable and value elimination in binary constraint satisfaction via   forbidden patterns,"David A. Cohen, Martin C.

A variable elimination rule (value elimination rule) allows the polynomial-time identification of certain variables (domain elements) whose elimination, without the introduction of extra compensatory constraints, does not affect the satisfiability of an instance. We show that there are essentially just four variable elimination rules and three value elimination rules defined by forbidding generic sub-instances, known as irreducible existential patterns, in arc-consistent CSP instances. One of the variable elimination rules is the already-known Broken Triangle Property, whereas the other three are novel.

A Sound and Complete Axiomatization of Majority-n Logic,"Luca Amaru, Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon, Anupam Chattopadhyay, Giovanni De Micheli","Manipulating logic functions via majority operators recently drew the attention of researchers in computer science. For example, circuit optimization based on majority operators enables superior results as compared to traditional logic systems. Also, the Boolean satisfiability problem finds new solving approaches when described in terms of majority decisions. To support computer logic applications based on majority a sound and complete set of axioms is required. Most of the recent advances in majority logic deal only with ternary majority (MAJ- 3) operators because the axiomatization with solely MAJ-3 and complementation operators is well understood. However, it is of interest extending such axiomatization to n-ary majority operators (MAJ-n) from both the theoretical and practical perspective. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a sound and complete axiomatization of MAJ-n logic. Our axiomatization naturally includes existing majority logic systems. Based on this general set of axioms, computer applications can now fully exploit the expressive power of majority logic.",2015-02-23T09:42:56Z,2015-11-25T10:36:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06359v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06359v3,cs.LO
Deterministic treatment of model error in geophysical data assimilation,"Alberto Carrassi, Stéphane Vannitsem","This chapter describes a novel approach for the treatment of model error in geophysical data assimilation. In this method, model error is treated as a deterministic process fully correlated in time. This allows for the derivation of the evolution equations for the relevant moments of the model error statistics required in data assimilation procedures, along with an approximation suitable for application to large numerical models typical of environmental science. In this contribution we first derive the equations for the model error dynamics in the general case, and then for the particular situation of parametric error. We show how this deterministic description of the model error can be incorporated in sequential and variational data assimilation procedures. A numerical comparison with standard methods is given using low-order dynamical systems, prototypes of atmospheric circulation, and a realistic soil model. The deterministic approach proves to be very competitive with only minor additional computational cost. Most importantly, it offers a new way to address the problem of accounting for model error in data assimilation that can easily be implemented in systems of increasing complexity and in the context of modern ensemble-based procedures.",2015-03-03T07:12:18Z,2015-11-10T15:09:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00842v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00842v2,physics.ao-ph

Elegans} in response to vibrating the surface on which it is moving; the neural circuit underlying this response is the subject of this investigation. Specifically, we perform reachability analysis on the TW circuit model of Wicks et al. (1996), which enables us to estimate key circuit parameters. Underlying our approach is the use of Fan and Mitra's recently developed technique for automatically computing local discrepancy (convergence and divergence rates) of general nonlinear systems. We show that the results we obtain are in agreement with the experimental results of Wicks et al. (1995).

Differential Hybrid Games,André Platzer,"This article introduces differential hybrid games, which combine differential games with hybrid games. In both kinds of games, two players interact with continuous dynamics.

Fixed points in conjunctive networks and maximal independent sets in   graph contractions,"Julio Aracena, Adrien Richard, Lilian Salinas","Given a graph $G$, viewed as a loop-less symmetric digraph, we study the maximum number of fixed points in a conjunctive boolean network with $G$ as interaction graph. We prove that if $G$ has no induced $C_4$, then this quantity equals both the number of maximal independent sets in $G$ and the maximum number of maximal independent sets among all the graphs obtained from $G$ by contracting some edges. We also prove that, in the general case, it is coNP-hard to decide if one of these equalities holds, even if $G$ has a unique induced $C_4$.",2015-07-22T11:56:20Z,2017-04-18T10:52:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06141v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.06141v2,"math.CO, cs.DM"
Proceedings Tenth International Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta   Languages: Theory and Practice,"Iliano Cervesato, Kaustuv Chaudhuri","This volume constitutes the proceedings of LFMTP 2015, the Tenth International Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice, held on August 1st, 2015 in Berlin, Germany. The workshop was a one-day satellite event of CADE-25, the 25th International Conference on Automated Deduction. Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design and implementation and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of formal computational systems have been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop brought together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.",2015-07-27T22:45:43Z,2015-07-27T22:45:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.07597v1,"cs.LO, cs.PL"

Zebrafish collective behaviour in heterogeneous environment modeled by a   stochastic model based on visual perception,"Bertrand Collignon, Axel Séguret, José Halloy","Collective motion is one of the most ubiquitous behaviours displayed by social organisms and has led to the development of numerous models. Recent advances in the understanding of sensory system and information processing by animals impel to revise classical assumptions made in decisional algorithms. In this context, we present a new model describing the three dimensional visual sensory system of fish that adjust their trajectory according to their perception field. Furthermore, we introduce a new stochastic process based on a probability distribution function to move in targeted directions rather than on a summation of influential vectors as it is classically assumed by most models. We show that this model can spontaneously transits from consensus to choice. In parallel, we present experimental results of zebrafish (alone or in group of 10) swimming in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We use these experimental data to set the parameter values of our model and show that this perception-based approach can simulate the collective motion of species showing cohesive behaviour in heterogeneous environments. Finally, we discuss the advances of this multilayer model and its possible outcomes in biological, physical and robotic sciences.",2015-09-04T13:50:03Z,2015-09-04T13:50:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01448v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01448v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Evaluation of Variability Concepts for Simulink in the Automotive Domain,"Carsten Kolassa, Holger Rendel, Bernhard Rumpe","Modeling variability in Matlab/Simulink becomes more and more important. We took the two variability modeling concepts already included in Matlab/Simulink and our own one and evaluated them to find out which one is suited best for modeling variability in the automotive domain. We conducted a controlled experiment with developers at Volkswagen AG to decide which concept is preferred by developers and if their preference aligns with measurable performance factors. We found out that all existing concepts are viable approaches and that the delta approach is both the preferred concept as well as the objectively most efficient one, which makes Delta-Simulink a good solution to model variability in the automotive domain.",2015-09-08T09:13:53Z,2015-09-08T09:13:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02289v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02289v1,"cs.SE, D.2; K.6.3; D.2.1; D.2.2"

For single process synthesis it is well-established that such parametric extensions do not increase worst-case complexities.   For synchronous systems, we show that, despite being more powerful, the distributed realizability problem for PROMPT-LTL is not harder than its LTL counterpart. For asynchronous systems we have to consider an assume-guarantee synthesis problem, as we have to express scheduling assumptions. As asynchronous distributed synthesis is already undecidable for LTL, we give a semi-decision procedure for the PROMPT-LTL assume-guarantee synthesis problem based on bounded synthesis.",2015-09-17T06:39:09Z,2016-09-14T00:59:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05144v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.05144v3,"cs.LO, cs.GT"

We also provide a reduction-preserving translation in the other direction, from CRSs to NRSs, improving over a previously defined translation. These tools, together with existing translations between CRSs and other higher-order rewriting formalisms, open up the path for a transfer of results between higher-order and nominal rewriting.

This closes the gap between the previously known upper bound of $O(n^3)$ and lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$.

Solvation of the Morpholinium Cation in Acetonitrile. Effect of an Anion,"Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda A. Andreeva","Ionic liquids constitute a fast growing class of compounds finding multiple applications in science and technology. Morpholinium-based ionic liquids (MBILs) and their mixtures with polar molecular co-solvents are interesting as sustainable electrolyte systems for electrochemistry. We investigate local structures of protic and propton-free morpholinium cations in acetonitrile (ACN) using semi-empirical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An impact of an anion (acetate) on the cation solvation regularities is discussed. Unlike oxygen, nitrogen of the morpholine ring is a strong electrophilic binding center. This site is responsible for the interactions of the cation with the solvent and with the anion. In protic MBILs, the role of nitrogen is delegated to the proton, which is linked to nitrogen. The acetate anion weakens solvation of the cation due to occupation of space near nitrogen or proton. The analysis reveals a favorable solvation of MBILs in ACN, which is a prerequisite for a new high-performance electrolyte system. The reported structural data are validated through a point-to-point comparison with the MP2 post-Hartree-Fock theory.",2015-11-23T12:20:12Z,2015-11-23T12:20:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07192v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07192v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

Finite Countermodel Based Verification for Program Transformation (A   Case Study),"Alexei P. Lisitsa, Andrei P. Nemytykh","Both automatic program verification and program transformation are based on program analysis. In the past decade a number of approaches using various automatic general-purpose program transformation techniques (partial deduction, specialization, supercompilation) for verification of unreachability properties of computing systems were introduced and demonstrated. On the other hand, the semantics based unfold-fold program transformation methods pose themselves diverse kinds of reachability tasks and try to solve them, aiming at improving the semantics tree of the program being transformed. That means some general-purpose verification methods may be used for strengthening program transformation techniques. This paper considers the question how finite countermodels for safety verification method might be used in Turchin's supercompilation method.

Theory of non-local point transformations - Part 2: General form and   Gedanken experiment,"Massimo Tessarotto, Claudio Cremaschini",The problem is posed of further extending the axiomatic construction proposed in Part 1 for non-local point transformations mapping in each other different curved space times. The new transformations apply to curved space times when expressed in arbitrary coordinate systems.

In this paper, we propose a new approach towards tackling the problem. Our approach is inspired by the {\em shock model} and {\em random environment} techniques in the Theory of Reliability, while accommodating security ingredients. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first that can accommodate a certain degree of {\em adaptiveness of attacks}, which substantially weakens the often-made independence and exponential attack inter-arrival time assumptions.

The obtained analytical potential is suitable for simulations of H in bulk Fe as well as for modeling small FeH molecules, and it can be directly combined with our previously constructed potential for the stainless steel Fe-Cr-C system. This will allow simulations of, e.g., hydrocarbon molecule chemistry on steel surfaces.

A fundamental need in big data research is to process data tabulated as large-scale matrices using eigenvectors. A higher order generalized singular value decomposition technique successfully captures the common features of the same organ from multiple animals in genomic signal processing. A recent semidefinite programming approach to solve an AC optimal power flow was accompanied by the problem formulation in the Cartesian coordinate system. The collection of nodal Kirchhoff laws introduces a 3D tensor with a common feature of individual matrices to maintain local power balance.

Scenario-based decision-making for power systems investment planning,"Jialin Liu, Olivier Teytaud","The optimization of power systems involves complex uncertainties, such as technological progress, political context, geopolitical constraints. Negotiations at COP21 are complicated by the huge number of scenarios that various people want to consider; these scenarios correspond to many uncertainties. These uncertainties are difficult to modelize as probabilities, due to the lack of data for future technologies and due to partially adversarial geopolitical decision makers. Tools for such difficult decision making problems include Wald and Savage criteria, possibilistic reasoning and Nash equilibria. We investigate the rationale behind the use of a two-player Nash equilibrium approach in such a difficult context; we show that the computational cost is indeed smaller than for simpler criteria. Moreover, it naturally provides a selection of decisions and scenarios, and it has a natural interpretation in the sense that Nature does not make decisions taking into account our own decisions. The algorithm naturally provides a matrix of results, namely the matrix of outcomes in the most interesting decisions and for the most critical scenarios.

Epistemic extensions of combined classical and intuitionistic   propositional logic,Steffen Lewitzka,"Logic $L$ was introduced by Lewitzka [7] as a modal system that combines intuitionistic and classical logic: $L$ is a conservative extension of CPC and it contains a copy of IPC via the embedding $\varphi\mapsto\square\varphi$. In this article, we consider $L3$, i.e. $L$ augmented with S3 modal axioms, define basic epistemic extensions and prove completeness w.r.t. algebraic semantics. The resulting logics combine classical knowledge and belief with intuitionistic truth. Some epistemic laws of Intuitionistic Epistemic Logic studied by Artemov and Protopopescu [1] are reflected by classical modal principles. In particular, the implications ""intuitionistic truth $\Rightarrow$ knowledge $\Rightarrow$ classical truth"" are represented by the theorems $\square\varphi\rightarrow K\varphi$ and $K\varphi\rightarrow\varphi$ of our logic $EL3$, where we are dealing with classical instead of intuitionistic knowledge. Finally, we show that a modification of our semantics yields algebraic models for the systems of Intuitionistic Epistemic Logic introduced in [1].",2016-11-04T15:49:17Z,2017-02-27T17:12:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01429v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01429v2,cs.LO
Inductive decision based Real Time Occupancy detector in University   Buildings,"Nkita Jain, Rachita Gupta","The ability to estimate College Campus Occupancy for Classrooms and Labs in real time has become one of the major concerns for various Academicians, authorities and administrators,where still a manual attendance marking system is being followed.

Parameterisation of non-collinear energy landscapes in itinerant magnets,"Adam Jacobsson, G. Johansson, O. I. Gorbatov, Marjana. Ležaić, Biplab Sanyal, Stefan Blügel, Corina Etz","The magnetic force theorem provides convenient ways to study exchange interactions in magnetic systems. However, it is well known that short range interactions in itinerant magnetic systems are poorly described with the conventional use of the theorem and numerous strategies have been developed over the years to overcome this deficiency. In this study, we discuss this issue in the context of the frozen magnon method and find that a self-consistent approach is in general preferable. Moreover, an extended Heisenberg model is suggested in order to better describe finite deviations from the magnetic ground state and is shown through cross-validation to give a superior description of the interactions in non-collinear magnetic configurations compared to the regular Heisenberg model. The present study thus supplies a fully self-consistent method for systematic investigations of exchange interactions beyond the standard Heisenberg model.

Cyclic Dominance in the Spatial Coevolutionary Optional Prisoner's   Dilemma Game,"Marcos Cardinot, Josephine Griffith, Colm O'Riordan","This paper studies scenarios of cyclic dominance in a coevolutionary spatial model in which game strategies and links between agents adaptively evolve over time. The Optional Prisoner's Dilemma (OPD) game is employed. The OPD is an extended version of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma where players have a third option to abstain from playing the game. We adopt an agent-based simulation approach and use Monte Carlo methods to perform the OPD with coevolutionary rules. The necessary conditions to break the scenarios of cyclic dominance are also investigated. This work highlights that cyclic dominance is essential in the sustenance of biodiversity.

We give a coalgebraic account of distribution bisimilarity, and explain the genesis of the belief-state transformer from a PA. To do so, we make explicit the convex algebraic structure present in PA and identify belief-state transformers as transition systems with state space that carries a convex algebra.

Despite its power, GW is not routinely applied to large complex materials due to its computational expense. We perform an exact recasting of the GW polarizability and the self-energy as Laplace integrals over imaginary time propagators. We then ""shred"" the propagators (via energy windowing) and approximate them in a controlled manner by using Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and discrete variable methods to treat the imaginary time propagators in real space. The resulting cubic scaling GW method has a sufficiently small prefactor to outperform standard quartic scaling methods on small systems (>=10 atoms) and also represents a substantial improvement over several other cubic methods tested.

In the current scenario, radio halos are generated through re--acceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated by cluster mergers. Although this theoretical framework has received increasingly supporting observational evidence over the last ten years, observations of statistically complete samples are needed in order to fundamentally test model predictions.

"Privacy Risk Assessment: From Art to Science, By Metrics","Isabel Wagner, Eerke Boiten","Privacy risk assessments aim to analyze and quantify the privacy risks associated with new systems. As such, they are critically important in ensuring that adequate privacy protections are built in. However, current methods to quantify privacy risk rely heavily on experienced analysts picking the ""correct"" risk level on e.g. a five-point scale. In this paper, we argue that a more scientific quantification of privacy risk increases accuracy and reliability and can thus make it easier to build privacy-friendly systems. We discuss how the impact and likelihood of privacy violations can be decomposed and quantified, and stress the importance of meaningful metrics and units of measurement. We suggest a method of quantifying and representing privacy risk that considers a collection of factors as well as a variety of contexts and attacker models.

Quantum Mechanical Foundations of Epistemology,Bruce Levinson,"Scholars of the history and philosophy of science have asked what would decolonized science would look like. This paper develops an answer by interrogating the assumption that observations need to be recorded and communicated using the language of classical physics. Niels Bohr held this assumption even though he recognized the fact that quantum phenomena cannot be analyzed on classical lines. Classical analysis requires the objectification of whatever is being observed so that it can be objectively described. Inherent in this analysis is the intellectual creation of a transcendental verity, a view from nowhere. In contrast, knowledge systems that predate European colonialism make use of the quantum nature of nature without constructing an objective model of it. This paper concludes that uncolonized knowledge systems differ from classical ones in that they are epistemically plural, accepting multiple true observations of the same phenomenon.",2017-08-24T13:44:39Z,2024-05-22T16:24:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09508v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09508v4,"physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"

The non-idempotent approach provides very simple combinatorial arguments-based on decreasing measures of type derivations-to characterize head and strongly normalizing terms. Moreover, typability provides upper bounds for the lengths of the head reduction and the maximal reduction sequences to normal-form. In the second part of this paper, the {\lambda}{\mu}-calculus is refined to a small-step calculus called {\lambda}{\mu}s, which is inspired by the substitution at a distance paradigm. The {\lambda}{\mu}s-calculus turns out to be compatible with a natural extensionof the non-idempotent interpretations of {\lambda}{\mu}, i.e., {\lambda}{\mu}s-reduction preserves and decreases typing derivations in an extended appropriate typing system.

Decidability for Entailments of Symbolic Heaps with Arrays,"Daisuke Kimura, Makoto Tatsuta",This paper presents two decidability results on the validity checking problem for entailments of symbolic heaps in separation logic with Presburger arithmetic and arrays. The first result is for a system with arrays and existential quantifiers. The correctness of the decision procedure is proved under the condition that sizes of arrays in the succedent are not existentially quantified. This condition is different from that proposed by Brotherston et al. in 2017 and one of them does not imply the other. The main idea is a novel translation from an entailment of symbolic heaps into a formula in Presburger arithmetic. The second result is the decidability for a system with both arrays and lists. The key idea is to extend the unroll collapse technique proposed by Berdine et al. in 2005 to arrays and arithmetic as well as double-linked lists.,2018-02-16T14:00:00Z,2021-05-10T16:09:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05935v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05935v4,cs.LO

In this paper, we introduce the class of \emph{o-minimal invariants}, which is broader than any previously considered, and study the decidability of the existence and algorithmic synthesis of such invariants as certificates of non-termination for linear loops equipped with a large class of halting conditions.

Our experiments extend a useful branch in application of this technique for studying thermal properties of suspended layered ribbons and have potential application in investigating the interfacial thermal resistance of different 2D heterojunctions.",2018-03-21T06:13:53Z,2018-03-21T06:13:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07757v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07757v1,cond-mat.mes-hall
Anomaly Detection for Industrial Big Data,"Neil Caithness, David Wallom","As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) grows, systems are increasingly being monitored by arrays of sensors returning time-series data at ever-increasing 'volume, velocity and variety' (i.e. Industrial Big Data). An obvious use for these data is real-time systems condition monitoring and prognostic time to failure analysis (remaining useful life, RUL). (e.g. See white papers by Senseye.io, and output of the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE).) However, as noted by Agrawal and Choudhary 'Our ability to collect ""big data"" has greatly surpassed our capability to analyze it, underscoring the emergence of the fourth paradigm of science, which is data-driven discovery.' In order to fully utilize the potential of Industrial Big Data we need data-driven techniques that operate at scales that process models cannot. Here we present a prototype technique for data-driven anomaly detection to operate at industrial scale. The method generalizes to application with almost any multivariate dataset based on independent ordinations of repeated (bootstrapped) partitions of the dataset and inspection of the joint distribution of ordinal distances.",2018-04-09T14:09:47Z,2018-04-09T14:09:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02998v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02998v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
"Slow relaxation dynamics in binary glasses during stress-controlled,   tension-compression cyclic loading",Nikolai V. Priezjev,"The effect of cyclic loading on relaxation dynamics and mechanical properties of metallic glasses is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. We consider the Kob-Andersen three-dimensional binary mixture rapidly cooled across the glass transition and subjected to thousands of tension-compression cycles in the elastic range. It was found that during cyclic loading at constant pressure, the system is relocated to progressively lower levels of the potential energy, thus promoting greater densification and higher strength. Furthermore, with increasing stress amplitude, the average glass density increases and the minimum of the potential energy becomes deeper, while the elastic modulus is reduced. The typical size of clusters of atoms with large nonaffine displacements becomes smaller over consecutive cycles, which correlates with the gradual decrease in the potential energy. These results are important for thermomechanical processing of metallic glasses with improved mechanical properties.",2018-04-19T14:22:20Z,2018-04-19T14:22:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07189v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07189v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Towards the manipulation of topological states of matter: A perspective   from electron transport,"Cheng Zhang, Hai-Zhou Lu, Shun-Qing Shen, Yong P. Chen, Faxian Xiu","The introduction of topological invariants, ranging from insulators to metals, has provided new insights into the traditional classification of electronic states in condensed matter physics. A sudden change in the topological invariant at the boundary of a topological nontrivial system leads to the formation of exotic surface states that are dramatically different from its bulk. In recent years, significant advancements in the exploration of the physical properties of these topological systems and regarding device research related to spintronics and quantum computation have been made. Here, we review the progress of the characterization and manipulation of topological phases from the electron transport perspective and also the intriguing chiral/Majorana states that stem from them.

Towards learning-to-learn,"Benjamin James Lansdell, Konrad Paul Kording","In good old-fashioned artificial intelligence (GOFAI), humans specified systems that solved problems. Much of the recent progress in AI has come from replacing human insights by learning. However, learning itself is still usually built by humans -- specifically the choice that parameter updates should follow the gradient of a cost function. Yet, in analogy with GOFAI, there is no reason to believe that humans are particularly good at defining such learning systems: we may expect learning itself to be better if we learn it. Recent research in machine learning has started to realize the benefits of that strategy. We should thus expect this to be relevant for neuroscience: how could the correct learning rules be acquired? Indeed, cognitive science has long shown that humans learn-to-learn, which is potentially responsible for their impressive learning abilities. Here we discuss ideas across machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science that matter for the principle of learning-to-learn.",2018-11-01T05:07:49Z,2019-01-09T15:45:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00231v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00231v3,"q-bio.NC, cs.LG"
Understanding electron correlation energy through density functional   theory,"Teepanis Chachiyo, Hathaithip Chachiyo","A curious behavior of electron correlation energy is explored. Namely, the correlation energy is the energy that tends to drive the system toward that of the uniform electron gas. As such, the energy assumes its maximum value when a gradient of density is zero. As the gradient increases, the energy is diminished by a gradient suppressing factor, designed to attenuate the energy from its maximum value similar to the shape of a bell curve. Based on this behavior, we constructed a very simple mathematical formula that predicted the correlation energy of atoms and molecules. Combined with our proposed exchange energy functional, we calculated the correlation energies, the total energies, and the ionization energies of test atoms and molecules; and despite the unique simplicities, the functionals' accuracies are in the top tier performance, competitive to the B3LYP, BLYP, PBE, TPSS, and M11. Therefore, we propose that, as guided by the simplicities and supported by the accuracies, the correlation energy is the energy that locally tends to drive the system toward the uniform electron gas.",2018-11-02T02:37:41Z,2019-08-01T04:25:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00712v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00712v2,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.chem-ph"

Thanks to its versatility, LEEM/PEEM systems are currently employed to study model systems in the fields of nanotechnology, nanomagnetism, material science, catalysis, energy storage, thin films and 2D materials. In the following chapter, we will present a brief but complete review of this class of instruments. After an historical digression in the introducing section, we will show first the basic operating principles of a simple setup and then the elements that can be added to improve the performances. Later, two sections will be dedicated to LEEM and PEEM respectively.

Solvability = Typability + Inhabitation,"Antonio Bucciarelli, Delia Kesner, Simona Ronchi Della Rocca","We extend the classical notion of solvability to a lambda-calculus equipped with pattern matching. We prove that solvability can be characterized by means of typability and inhabitation in an intersection type system P based on non-idempotent types. We show first that the system P characterizes the set of terms having canonical form, i.e. that a term is typable if and only if it reduces to a canonical form. But the set of solvable terms is properly contained in the set of canonical forms. Thus, typability alone is not sufficient to characterize solvability, in contrast to the case for the lambda-calculus. We then prove that typability, together with inhabitation, provides a full characterization of solvability, in the sense that a term is solvable if and only if it is typable and the types of all its arguments are inhabited. We complete the picture by providing an algorithm for the inhabitation problem of P.",2018-12-14T16:27:40Z,2021-01-28T13:07:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06009v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06009v4,"cs.LO, cs.PL"

We argue that one reason is the difficulty to interpret the internals of trained networks. In this study, we look at the application of LSTMs for rainfall-runoff forecasting, one of the central tasks in the field of hydrology, in which the river discharge has to be predicted from meteorological observations. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for this problem since memory cells can represent dynamic reservoirs and storages, which are essential components in state-space modelling approaches of the hydrological system. On basis of two different catchments, one with snow influence and one without, we demonstrate how the trained model can be analyzed and interpreted.

This transition is observed both in static and shear tests. The grain volume fraction at which the transition occurs, $\nu_c$, decreases with increasing friction between the grains. Densely packed grains, with a volume fraction $\nu> \nu_c$, display an elastic-plastic rheology. Dilute packings, with $\nu<\nu_c$, display gas-like characteristics. Packings with $\nu=\nu_c$ display phase coexistance. It is shown that when volume fraction is allowed to change freely (using constant normal stress boundary condition), it evolves spontaneously to $\nu_c$ under a wide range of boundary conditions, exhibiting 'self-organized criticality'.",1998-12-11T18:36:37Z,1998-12-11T18:36:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9812204v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9812204v1,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"

Electronic transmission of a nanowire partly irradiated under terahertz   electromagnetic field,"Guanhui Zhou, Mou Yang",We theoretically study the electronic transport of a nanowire partly irradiated under an external terahertz (THz) electromagnetic field. Although the electrons in the ballistic nanowires only suffer lateral collision with photons the reflection of electrons also takes place in this partly irradiated case. Using free-electron model and scattering matrix approach we showed that at resonance there exists a step decrement of 50 percent for the transmission probability as the amplitude of field increases to a certain volume. And the coherent structure of transmission for the system apparently appears when the field irradiate the middle part of nanowire only.

Critical network effect induces business oscillations in multi-level   marketing systems,Dranreb Earl Juanico,"The ""social-networking revolution"" of late (e.g., with the advent of social media, Facebook, and the like) has been propelling the crusade to elucidate the embedded networks that underlie economic activity.

An Optimization Framework to Improve 4D-Var Data Assimilation System   Performance,"Alexandru Cioaca, Adrian Sandu","This paper develops a computational framework for optimizing the parameters of data assimilation systems in order to improve their performance. The approach formulates a continuous meta-optimization problem for parameters; the meta-optimization is constrained by the original data assimilation problem.

The proposed framework is applied to optimize observation values, data weighting coefficients, and the location of sensors for a test problem.

Multiferroicity in V-doped PbTiO$_{3}$,"Francesco Ricci, Vincenzo Fiorentini","We report \emph{ab initio} predictions on the proper multiferroic (ferromagnetic, insulating and ferroelectric) character of PbTiO$_{3}$ doped with vanadium. V impurities coupled ferromagnetically carry a magnetization of 1 $\mu_{\rm B}$ each. The coupling is expected to be strong, since the paramagnetic solution is higher by 150 meV/vanadium, and no stable antiferromagnetic solution was found. The electronic gap in the doped system is about 0.2-0.3 eV in GGA, hence the system is properly multiferroic. V doping increases the spontaneous polarization in PbTiO$_{3}$, with an approximate percentual rate of 0.7 $\mu$C/cm$^{2}$.",2013-09-27T11:09:43Z,2013-09-27T11:09:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7205v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7205v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

We then argue that something close to Boltzmann's proposal is true: gases behave thermodynamic-like if they are epsilon-ergodic, i.e., ergodic on the phase space except for a small region of measure epsilon.

The reversal process is studied in two material systems, Pt/CoFeB and Pt/NiFe, for different aspect ratios. The onset of the switching behavior is indicated by a sharp transition in the spin pumping voltage. At a threshold value of the external field, the switching process changes from partial to full reversal with increasing microwave power. The proposed method provides a simple way to detect microwave assisted magnetization reversal.",2014-04-04T02:37:08Z,2014-04-04T02:37:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1133v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1133v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

Role reversal in a predator-prey interaction,"Faustino Sánchez-Garduño, Pedro Miramontes, Tatiana T.

Casimir interactions in strained graphene systems,"Anh D. Phan, The-Long Phan",We theoretically study the strain effect on the Casimir interactions in graphene based systems. We found that the interactions between two strained graphene sheets are strongly dependent on the direction of stretching.

We study the effect of thermal fluctuations in two disordered central-force lattice models near mechanical instability: randomly diluted triangular lattice and randomly braced square lattice. These two lattices exhibit different scalings for the emergence of rigidity at $T=0$ due to their different patterns of self stress at the transition. Using analytic theory we show that thermal fluctuations stabilize both lattices. In particular, the triangular lattice displays a critical regime in which the shear modulus scales as $G \sim T^{1/2}$, whereas the square lattice shows $G \sim T^{2/3}$.",2015-03-18T03:09:35Z,2015-03-18T03:09:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05274v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05274v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.stat-mech"

These models, for instance Rayleigh damping, account for the damping sources in the system altogether and often lack physical basis. We report on an alternative path for reproducing damping coming from material nonlinear response through the consideration of the heterogeneous character of material mechanical properties. The parameterization of that heterogeneity is performed through a stochastic model.

Efficient Checking of Individual Rewards Properties in Markov Population   Models,"Luca Bortolussi, Jane Hillston","In recent years fluid approaches to the analysis of Markov populations models have been demonstrated to have great pragmatic value. Initially developed to estimate the behaviour of the system in terms of the expected values of population counts, the fluid approach has subsequently been extended to more sophisticated interrogations of models through its embedding within model checking procedures. In this paper we extend recent work on checking CSL properties of individual agents within a Markovian population model, to consider the checking of properties which incorporate rewards.",2015-09-29T02:10:30Z,2015-09-29T02:10:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08561v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08561v1,"cs.LO, cs.PF, cs.SY"

A Formal System: Rigorous Constructions of Computer Models,Garry Pantelis,This book explores an alternative to the current dominant paradigm where a discrete computer model is constructed as an attempt to approximate some continuum theory. We focus on a class of discrete computer models that are based on simple deterministic rules and finite state arithmetic. Such models are highly compatible with the operational parameters of the real world computer on which they are executed and hence their validation can be associated with the allowable computations on the machine. A simple formal system based on a language of functional programs is employed as a tool of analysis.,2015-10-15T11:03:53Z,2017-04-13T10:16:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04469v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04469v3,"cs.LO, 03B35 (Primary), 00A71, 03B15 (Secondary), D.2.4; F.4.1"

A Classical Realizability Model for a Semantical Value Restriction,Rodolphe Lepigre,"We present a new type system with support for proofs of programs in a call-by-value language with control operators. The proof mechanism relies on observational equivalence of (untyped) programs. It appears in two type constructors, which are used for specifying program properties and for encoding dependent products. The main challenge arises from the lack of expressiveness of dependent products due to the value restriction. To circumvent this limitation we relax the syntactic restriction and only require equivalence to a value. The consistency of the system is obtained semantically by constructing a classical realizability model in three layers (values, stacks and terms).",2016-03-24T09:00:30Z,2016-04-07T13:48:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07484v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07484v2,"cs.LO, cs.PL, math.LO"

We introduce two new logics L_D and L_I, based on Kripke semantics, and propose them as alternatives for D and I, respectively. We analyze the relative expressive powers of these four logics and discuss the way these systems relate to natural language. We argue that L_D and L_I naturally resolve a range of interpretational problems that arise in D and I. We also obtain sound and complete axiomatizations for L_D and L_I.",2016-09-23T15:24:38Z,2017-12-03T22:09:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07398v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07398v2,"math.LO, cs.LO"

The conclusion is that accreting gas without stars is detected almost entirely within the circumgalactic medium of large galaxies and is rare otherwise.

Going beyond plain, strong normalisation without losing soundness turns out to be a hard task, which cannot be accomplished without a richer, quantitative notion of types, but also without imposing some affinity constraints. The proposed type system is powerful enough to type classic examples of probabilistically terminating programs such as random walks.

A key scientific and technological challenge is to stabilize and control coexistence of symmetry-distinct phases with external stimuli. Using BiFeO3 (BFO) layers confined between layers of the dielectric TbScO3 as a model system, we stabilize the mixed-phase coexistence of centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric BFO phases with antipolar, insulating and polar, semiconducting behavior, respectively at room temperature. Application of in-plane electric (polar) fields can both remove and introduce centrosymmetry from the system resulting in reversible, nonvolatile interconversion between the two phases. This interconversion between the centrosymmetric insulating and non-centrosymmetric semiconducting phases coincides with simultaneous changes in the non-linear optical response of over three orders of magnitude, a change in resistivity of over five orders of magnitude, and a change in the polar order.

The Importance of Being Discrete - Life Always Wins on the Surface,"Nadav M. Shnerb, Yoram Louzoun, Eldad Bettelheim, Sorin Solomon","Many systems in chemistry, biology, finance and social sciences present emerging features which are not easy to guess from the elementary interactions of their microscopic individual components. In the past, the macroscopic behavior of such systems was modeled by assuming that the collective dynamics of microscopic components can be effectively described collectively by equations acting on spatially continuous density distributions. It turns out that quite contrary, taking into account the actual individual/discrete character of the microscopic components of these systems is crucial for explaining their macroscopic behavior. In fact, we find that in conditions in which the continuum approach would predict the extinction of all the population (respectively the vanishing of the invested capital or of the concentration of a chemical substance, etc), the microscopic granularity insures the emergence of macroscopic localized sub-populations with collective adaptive properties which allow their survival and development. In particular it is found that in 2 dimensions ""life"" (the localized proliferating phase) always prevails.",1999-12-29T19:24:55Z,1999-12-29T19:24:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/adap-org/9912005v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/adap-org/9912005v1,"adap-org, cond-mat.stat-mech, nlin.AO, nlin.CG, q-bio"
Resolving the C IV and Mg II Absorption in NGC 4151,Gerard A. Kriss,"Observations of the C IV and Mg II absorption lines in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 obtained with the GHRS in October 1994 are presented. The data from the STScI archive show multiple broad and narrow components in both species. In addition to Galactic absorption, four narrow and four broad systems associated with NGC 4151 are identified. Two broad systems dominate the total equivalent width, and their mean blueshift and width are comparable to the broad Lyman line and continuum absorption seen in far-UV spectra from the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope. Narrow-line C IV emission is present on the red side of the broadest absorption trough, and narrow absorption at the systemic velocity of NGC 4151, presumably in its own ISM, absorbs the core of the narrow emission line. Strong Mg II absorption is present in all but two velocity systems. Ratios relative to the corresponding C IV components suggest a low ionization parameter for the absorbing gas: U ~ 1-3 x 10^{-3}. This makes none of the identified UV absorption systems a good candidate for association with the warm X-ray absorbing gas.",1996-10-07T13:27:58Z,1996-10-07T13:27:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9610043v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9610043v1,astro-ph
Non-pulsed emission from the binary system PSR B1259-63,"Maria A. Chernyakova, Andrei F.

A rapidly rotating radio pulsar is expected to produce a wind of relativistic particles. Be stars are known to produce highly asymmetric mass loss. Due to the interaction of the pulsar wind and the Be star wind the system of two shocks between the pulsar and the Be star forms. In this paper we show that the observed non-pulsed radio emission from the system is a result of the synchrotron emission of the relativistic particles in the outflow beyond the shock wave and that the non-pulsed X-ray emission is due to the inverse Compton scattering of the Be star photons on this particles.,2000-04-04T14:58:17Z,2000-04-04T14:58:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0004039v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0004039v1,astro-ph
Dynamical Instability and Statistical Behaviour of N-Body Systems,"Cipriani Piero, Di Bari Maria","We here describe the possibility of a synthetic description of the onset of Chaos in many degrees of freedom dynamical systems within the framework of the geometric description of dynamics. We show how this approach to instability helps to single out the transition between different regimes of stochasticity in typical as well peculiar N-body systems. It is shown how intermingled are the relationships between geometric properties of the manifold and stability properties of the dynamics, which do not follow any naive prescription. The implications concerning the possibility of a Statistical description are also addressed, and it is shown how the peculiarities of the interaction potential reflect themselves also on the geometric description. In particular, it is found that for the gravitational N-body system the dynamics possess features very similar to those of stable and tempered many body dynamical systems in the regime of strong stochasticity. All these issues are addressed from a semi-analytical approach, checked using well tailored numerical simulations, which help also to reinterpret some results recently appeared, and to correct to some extent previous claims presented in the literature.",1997-09-18T17:34:39Z,1997-09-18T17:34:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/chao-dyn/9709022v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/chao-dyn/9709022v1,"chao-dyn, astro-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, nlin.CD"

We introduce the notions of Lyapunov exponents, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and related quantities using some simple low-dimensional systems as ""toy"" models of the more complicated systems encountered in the study of fluids. We then show how familiar methods used in the kinetic theory of gases can be employed for explicit, analytical calculations of the largest Lyapunov exponent and KS entropy for dilute gases composed of hard spheres in d dimensions.

Based on the relative positions of the one-photon and two-photon states in long oligomers, we suggest that invoking interchain interactions is essential for explaining strong fluorescence in this system. Bond-order studies show that the lowest two-photon state corresponds to a localized excitation while one-photon and triplet excitations are extended in nature.

Toward semiclassical theory of quantum level correlations of generic   chaotic systems,Daniel L.

Recently this quantity has been computed for chaotic and for disordered systems using periodic orbit theory and field theory. In this work we present an independent derivation, which is based on periodic orbit theory. The main ingredient in our approach is the use of the spectral zeta function and its autocorrelation function $C(\epsilon)$. The relation between $R(\epsilon)$ and $C(\epsilon)$ is constructed by making use of a probabilistic reasoning similar to that which has been used for the derivation of Hardy -- Littlewood conjecture. We then convert the symmetry properties of the function $C(\epsilon)$ into relations between the so-called diagonal and the off-diagonal parts of $R(\epsilon)$.

The complete system is described within a modified Landauer-Buettiker formalism and we demonstrate that a parallel contribution of two electron systems in different valleys of the band structure can lead to an edge channel related non-local behaviour even in the 3D-regime. From the obtained general result we derive also a simplified model which applies for the case of much different dissipation.

We next use the finite temperature Thomas-Fermi method to demonstrate that in the local density approximation, these interacting fermions are equivalent to a system of noninteracting particles obeying the Haldane-Wu fractional exclusion statistics. It is also shown that mapping onto to a system of N noninteracting quasi-particles enables us to predict the energies of the excited states of the N-body system.",1999-02-11T00:19:35Z,1999-02-11T00:19:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9902158v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9902158v1,cond-mat
Macroscopic Polarization from Electronic Wavefunctions,Raffaele Resta,"The dipole moment of any finite and neutral system, having a square-integrable wavefunction, is a well defined quantity. The same quantity is ill-defined for an extended system, whose wavefunction invariably obeys periodic (Born-von Karman) boundary conditions. Despite this fact, macroscopic polarization is a theoretically accessible quantity, for either uncorrelated or correlated many-electron systems: in both cases, polarization is a rather ""exotic"" observable. For an uncorrelated-either Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham-crystalline solid, polarization has been expressed and computed as a Berry phase of the Bloch orbitals (since 1993). The case of a correlated and/or disordered system received a definitive solution only very recently (1998): this latest development allows us present here the whole theory from a novel, and very general, viewpoint.

Emergence of scaling in random networks,"Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Reka Albert","Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the world wide web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.",1999-10-21T15:29:02Z,1999-10-21T15:29:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9910332v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9910332v1,"cond-mat.dis-nn, adap-org, cond-mat.stat-mech, nlin.AO"
Nonequilibrium Mesoscopic Conductors Driven by Reservoirs,"Akira Shimizu, Hiroaki Kato","In order to specify a nonequilibrium steady state of a quantum wire (QWR), one must connect reservoirs to it. Since reservoirs should be large 2d or 3d systems, the total system is a large and inhomogeneous 2d or 3d system, in which e-e interactions have the same strength in all regions. However, most theories of interacting electrons in QWR considered simplified 1d models, in which reservoirs are absent or replaced with noninteracting 1d leads. We first discuss fundamental problems of such theories in view of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. We then present formulations which are free from such difficulties, and discuss what is going on in mesoscopic systems in nonequilibrium steady state.

Transport in a mesoscopic ring with a quantum dot: from the Coulomb   blockade regime to the Kondo effect,"Valeria Ferrari, Guillermo Chiappe, Enrique Anda","The system described in this work consists of a quantum dot inserted in a mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux. Our aim is to present a complete description for this device and to predict the physics of a experiment with these features.   We have proposed a model that takes into account the conditions that are usual in experiments with quantum dots and mesoscopic systems. In order to solve the model, we develop a methodology to find the Green's functions of the system by means of proper approximations.   This system presents persistent currents as a function of a gate potential applied to the quantum dot. We have studied the influence of both the interaction between electrons and the hybridization between the ring and the dot. We have found several regimes that describe different physical phenomena involved in the system. These regimes range from the phenomenon of Coulomb Blockade (in the high correlation limit) to a quasi non interacting regime. Between these two limits we have found an intermediate regime where the Kondo effect shows up.",2000-10-24T00:51:07Z,2000-10-24T00:51:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0010356v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0010356v1,cond-mat.mes-hall
Weak localization in ferromagnets with spin-orbit interaction,"V. K. Dugaev, P. Bruno, J. Barnas","Weak localization corrections to conductivity of ferromagnetic systems are studied theoretically in the case when spin-orbit interaction plays a significant role. Two cases are analyzed in detail: (i) the case when the spin-orbit interaction is due to scattering from impurities, and (ii) the case when the spin-orbit interaction results from reduced dimensionality of the system and is of the Bychkov-Rashba type. Results of the analysis show that the localization corrections to conductivity of ferromagnetic metals lead to a negative magnetoresistance -- also in the presence of the spin-orbit scattering. Positive magnetoresistance due to weak antilocalization, typical of nonmagnetic systems, does not occur in ferromagnetic systems. In the case of two-dimensional ferromagnets, the quantum corrections depend on the magnetization orientation with respect to the plane of the system.",2001-01-17T13:38:30Z,2001-05-15T10:47:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0101260v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0101260v2,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Crackling Noise,"James P. Sethna, Karin A. Dahmen, Christopher R. Myers","Crackling noise arises when a system responds to changing external conditions through discrete, impulsive events spanning a broad range of sizes. A wide variety of physical systems exhibiting crackling noise have been studied, from earthquakes on faults to paper crumpling. Because these systems exhibit regular behavior over many decades of sizes, their behavior is likely independent of microscopic and macroscopic details, and progress can be made by the use of very simple models. The fact that simple models and real systems can share the same behavior on a wide range of scales is called universality. We illustrate these ideas using results for our model of crackling noise in magnets, explaining the use of the renormalization group and scaling collapses. This field is still developing: we describe a number of continuing challenges.",2001-02-06T02:26:35Z,2001-02-06T02:26:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0102091v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0102091v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.soft"

The Jastrow function takes into account correlations between pairs of electrons. In simulations of solids, it is common to use a Jastrow function which is both homogeneous and isotropic. The use of a homogeneous and isotropic Jastrow factor is questionable in applications to systems with strong density inhomogeneities, such as surfaces and multilayers. By generalizing the original derivation of the RPA Jastrow factor for the homogeneous electron gas [Gaskell] to inhomogeneous systems we derive an scheme for generating inhomogeneous and anisotropic Jastrow factors for use in nonuniform systems, from the non-interacting static structure factor and density of the system.

The analytical calculation of the hysteresis curve of the system with interaction between nanoobjects is provided. It is shown that during the magnetization reversal system passes through a number of metastable states. The kinetic problem of the magnetization reversal was solved for three models. The following results have been obtained. 1) For 1D system (T=0) with the long-range interaction with the energy proportional to $r^{-p}$, the staircase-like shape of the magnetization curve has self-similar character. The nature of the steps is determined by interplay of the interparticle interaction and coercivity of the single nanoparticle. 2) The influence of the thermal fluctuations on the kinetic process was examined in the framework of the nearest-neighbor interaction model. The thermal fluctuations lead to the additional splitting of the steps on the magnetization curve. 3) The magnetization curve for system with interaction and coercivity dispersion was calculated in mean field approximation. The simple method to experimentally distinguish the influence of interaction and coercivity dispersion on the magnetization curve is suggested.",2001-04-26T10:52:28Z,2001-04-26T10:52:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0104507v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0104507v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Does Berry phase exist for a system coupled to its environment?,"Robert S. Whitney, Yuval Gefen","Berry phase was originally defined for systems whose states are separated by finite energy gaps. One might naively expect that a system without a gap cannot have a Berry phase. Despite this we ask whether a Berry phase can be observed in a system which has a continuous spectrum because its coupling to the environment has broadened its energy levels. We find that, contrary to the above naive expectation, there are conditions under which the Berry phase is observable. However it is modified by the presence of the environment and no longer has a simple geometric interpretation. The model system we consider is a spin-half in a slowly rotating magnetic field, with the spin also coupled to a Ohmic environment of harmonic oscillators (spin-boson model). Here we discuss the high-temperature limit of this model. We then interpret our results in terms of a spin under the influence of a classical stochastic field.",2001-07-17T10:39:48Z,2001-07-17T10:39:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0107359v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0107359v1,"cond-mat, quant-ph"

Overview of the main features and peculiar properties of the HF method are presented. A way to realize the HF method within the Kohn-Sham (KS) approach of the DFT is discussed. We show that this is impossible without including a specific correlation energy, which is defined by the difference between the sum of the kinetic and exchange energies of a system considered within KS and HF, respectively. It is the nonlocal exchange potential entering the HF equations that generates this correlation energy. We show that the total correlation energy of a finite electron system, which has to include this correlation energy, cannot be obtained from considerations of uniform electron systems. The single-particle excitation spectrum of many-electron systems is related to the eigenvalues of the corresponding KS equations. We demonstrate that this spectrum does not coincide in general with the eigenvalues of KS or HF equations.",2002-04-04T10:15:12Z,2003-12-07T21:48:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0204104v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0204104v2,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

Bond valence calculation for several perovskites and the evidences for a   valence charge transfer process in these compounds,Hoang Nam Nhat,"This paper presents the bond valence calculation for several perovskite systems and describes the evidences for a valence charge transfer process in these compounds.

On the basis of testing samples, the distribution of valence charge has been evaluated which showed the failure of elastic bonding mechanism on all studied systems and revealed the general deficit of valence charge in the unit cell. This deficit was not equally localized on all coordination spheres but proved asymmetrically distributed between the spheres. As the content of substitution increased, the charge deficit declined systematically from balanced level, signifying the continuous transfer of valence charge from the B-O6 to A-O12 spheres. The transfered charge varied from system to system, depending on the valence deviation of spheres and was not small. The total valence deviation reached near 2electron/unit cell in the studied systems. The local deviation may be more larger than this average value.

The Knight shifts, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates 1/T1 and the electronic specific heats Cel of these systems exhibit anomalous temperature (T) dependence at low temperatures, as was pointed out by Khalifah et al.

Ratios of 1/T1T to the square of the spin component of the isotropic Knight shift, Kspin estimated for these systems at low temperatures suggest that they have antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations. It is confirmed by the fact that the T-dependences of 1/T1T and Cel/T of the present systems can be explained by the self-consistent renormalization theory for three dimensional itinerant electron systems with AF spin fluctuations.

The electronic structure of the multilayers and the scattering potentials of point defects therein are calculated self-consistently. Residual resistivities are obtained by solving the quasi-classical Boltzmann equation including the electronic structure of the layered system, the anisotropic scattering cross sections derived by a Green's function method and the vertex corrections. Furthermore, the influence of scattering centers at the interfaces and within the metallic layers is incorporated by averaging the scattering cross sections of different impurities at various sites. An excellent agreement of experimental and theoretical results concerning the general trend of GMR in Co/Cu systems depending on the type and the position of impurities is obtained. Due to the quantum confinement in magnetic multilayers GMR can be tailored as a function of the impurity position. In Co/Cu and Fe/Au systems impurities in the magnetic layer lead to high GMR values, whereas in Fe/Cr systems defects at the interfaces are most efficient to increase GMR.",2005-04-25T14:24:50Z,2005-04-25T14:24:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0504634v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0504634v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Solitonic Phase in Manganites,"Luis Brey, P. B. Littlewood","Whenever a symmetry in the ground state of a system is broken, topological defects will exist. These defects are essential for understanding phase transitions in low dimensional systems[1]. Excitingly in some unique condensed matter systems the defects are also the low energy electric charge excitations. This is the case of skyrmions in quantum Hall ferromagnets[2] and solitons in polymers[3]. Orbital order present in several transitions metal compounds[4-6] could give rise to topological defects. Here we argue that the topological defects in orbital ordered half doped manganites are orbital solitons. Surprisingly, these solitons carry a fractional charge of $\pm$e/2, and whenever extra charge is added to the system an array of solitons is formed and an incommensurate solitonic phase occurs. The striking experimental asymmetry in the phase diagram as electrons or holes are added to half doped manganites[7-12], is explained by the energy difference between positive and negative charged solitons. Contrary to existent models that explain coexistence between phases in manganites as an extrinsic effect[13-14], the presence of inhomogeneities is naturally explained by the existence of solitonic phases. The occurrence and relevance of orbital solitons might be a general phenomena in strongly correlated systems.",2005-05-04T09:42:50Z,2005-05-04T09:42:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0505093v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0505093v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.str-el"

Its implementation on a simple prototype system of interacting elements with unknown random lifetimes undergoing irreversible damage until a global rupture occurs shows that the most probable predicted failure time (mode) may evolve non-monotonically with time as information is incorporated in the prediction scheme. In addition, both the mode, its standard deviation and, in fact, the full distribution of predicted failure times exhibit sensitive dependence on the realization of the system, similarly to ``chaos'' in spinglasses, providing a multi-dimensional dynamical explanation for the broad distribution of failure times observed in many empirical situations.",2005-11-05T00:13:38Z,2005-11-05T00:13:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0511134v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0511134v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.dis-nn"

For such mesoscopic systems the relaxation behavior differs substantially from the simple exponential relaxation. In particular, the equation shows the appearance of the recurrence phenomena on a time-scale determined by the slowest mode of the system.

Such modulated structures are important both as prototypes of simple nanotechnological devices and as particular examples of emerging spatial inhomogeneity in interacting many-electron systems. Here we investigate the effect different types of modulation of the system parameters have on the ground-state energy and the charge-density distribution of the system. The superlattices are described by the inhomogeneous attractive Hubbard model, and the calculations are performed by density-functional and density-matrix renormalization group techniques. We find that modulations in local electric potentials are much more effective in shaping the system's properties than modulations in the attractive on-site interaction.

Computing Functional and Relational Box Consistency by Structured   Propagation in Atomic Constraint Systems,M. H. van Emden,"Box consistency has been observed to yield exponentially better performance than chaotic constraint propagation in the interval constraint system obtained by decomposing the original expression into primitive constraints. The claim was made that the improvement is due to avoiding decomposition. In this paper we argue that the improvement is due to replacing chaotic iteration by a more structured alternative.   To this end we distinguish the existing notion of box consistency from relational box consistency. We show that from a computational point of view it is important to maintain the functional structure in constraint systems that are associated with a system of equations. So far, it has only been considered computationally important that constraint propagation be fair. With the additional structure of functional constraint systems, one can define and implement computationally effective, structured, truncated constraint propagations. The existing algorithm for box consistency is one such.

Distributed Control by Lagrangian Steepest Descent,"David H. Wolpert, Stefan Bieniawski","Often adaptive, distributed control can be viewed as an iterated game between independent players. The coupling between the players' mixed strategies, arising as the system evolves from one instant to the next, is determined by the system designer. Information theory tells us that the most likely joint strategy of the players, given a value of the expectation of the overall control objective function, is the minimizer of a Lagrangian function of the joint strategy. So the goal of the system designer is to speed evolution of the joint strategy to that Lagrangian minimizing point, lower the expectated value of the control objective function, and repeat. Here we elaborate the theory of algorithms that do this using local descent procedures, and that thereby achieve efficient, adaptive, distributed control.",2004-03-10T03:49:25Z,2004-03-10T03:49:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0403012v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0403012v1,"cs.MA, cs.GT, nlin.AO, J.6; J.7; G.m"
Deductive Algorithmic Knowledge,Riccardo Pucella,"The framework of algorithmic knowledge assumes that agents use algorithms to compute the facts they explicitly know. In many cases of interest, a deductive system, rather than a particular algorithm, captures the formal reasoning used by the agents to compute what they explicitly know. We introduce a logic for reasoning about both implicit and explicit knowledge with the latter defined with respect to a deductive system formalizing a logical theory for agents. The highly structured nature of deductive systems leads to very natural axiomatizations of the resulting logic when interpreted over any fixed deductive system. The decision problem for the logic, in the presence of a single agent, is NP-complete in general, no harder than propositional logic. It remains NP-complete when we fix a deductive system that is decidable in nondeterministic polynomial time.

For this purpose, we propose a model qCCS which is a natural quantum extension of classical value-passing CCS with the input and output of quantum states, and unitary transformations and measurements on quantum systems. The operational semantics of qCCS is given based on probabilistic labeled transition system. This semantics has many different features compared with the proposals in literature in order to describe input and output of quantum systems which are possibly correlated with other components. Based on this operational semantics, we introduce the notions of strong probabilistic bisimilarity and weak probabilistic bisimilarity between quantum processes and discuss some properties of them, such as congruence under various combinators.",2006-01-06T02:47:41Z,2013-11-14T09:03:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0601014v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0601014v3,"cs.LO, quant-ph, F.1.2"

Coupling Control and Human-Centered Automation in Mathematical Models of   Complex Systems,Roderick V. N. Melnik,"In this paper we analyze mathematically how human factors can be effectively incorporated into the analysis and control of complex systems. As an example, we focus our discussion around one of the key problems in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) theory and practice, the problem of speed control, considered here as a decision making process with limited information available. The problem is cast mathematically in the general framework of control problems and is treated in the context of dynamically changing environments where control is coupled to human-centered automation. Since in this case control might not be limited to a small number of control settings, as it is often assumed in the control literature, serious difficulties arise in the solution of this problem. We demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a set of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations where human factors are incorporated via estimations of the system Hamiltonian. In the ITS context, these estimations can be obtained with the use of on-board equipment like sensors/receivers/actuators, in-vehicle communication devices, etc. The proposed methodology provides a way to integrate human factor into the solving process of the models for other complex dynamic systems.",2007-02-25T11:09:12Z,2007-02-25T11:09:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0702149v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0702149v1,"cs.CE, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.IT, math.IT"

Analysis of Vibrations in Large Flexible Hybrid Systems,"Olena V. Mul, Delfim F. M. Torres","The mathematical model of a real flexible elastic system with distributed and discrete parameters is considered. It is a partial differential equation with non-classical boundary conditions. Complexity of the boundary conditions results in the impossibility to find exact analytical solutions. To address the problem, we use the asymptotical method of small parameter together with the numerical method of normal fundamental systems of solutions. These methods allow us to investigate vibrations, and a technique for determination of complex eigenvalues of the considered boundary value problem is developed. The conditions, at which vibration processes of different character take place, are defined. Dependence of the vibration frequencies on physical parameters of the hybrid system is studied. We show that introduction of different feedbacks into the system allow one to control the frequency spectrum, in which excitation of vibrations is possible.",2005-04-29T18:15:32Z,2005-04-29T18:15:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0504601v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0504601v1,"math.AP, math.OC, 93C20; 74H10; 74H15; 74H45"
An impact of stochastic dynamic boundary conditions on the evolution of   the Cahn-Hilliard system,"Desheng Yang, Jinqiao Duan","Nonlinear systems are often subject to random influences. Sometimes the noise enters the system through physical boundaries and this leads to stochastic dynamic boundary conditions. A dynamic, as opposed to static, boundary condition involves the time derivative as well as spatial derivatives for the system state variables on the boundary. Although stochastic \emph{static} (Neumann or Dirichet type) boundary conditions have been applied for stochastic partial differential equations, not much is known about the dynamical impact of stochastic \emph{dynamic} boundary conditions. The purpose of this paper is to study possible impacts of stochastic dynamic boundary conditions on the long term dynamics of the Cahn-Hilliard equation arising in the materials science. We show that the dimension estimation of the random attractor increases as the coefficient for the dynamic term in the stochastic dynamic boundary condition decreases. However, the dimension of the random attractor is not affected by the corresponding stochastic static boundary condition.",2006-08-04T22:04:30Z,2006-08-04T22:04:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608133v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0608133v1,"math.DS, math.AP, math.PR, 60H15; 37L55; 35R60"
Graph Theory and the Evolution of Autocatalytic Networks,"Sanjay Jain, Sandeep Krishna","We give a self-contained introduction to the theory of directed graphs, leading up to the relationship between the Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors of a graph and its autocatalytic sets. Then we discuss a particular dynamical system on a fixed but arbitrary graph, that describes the population dynamics of species whose interactions are determined by the graph. The attractors of this dynamical system are described as a function of graph topology. Finally we consider a dynamical system in which the graph of interactions of the species coevolves with the populations of the species. We show that this system exhibits complex dynamics including self-organization of the network by autocatalytic sets, growth of complexity and structure, and collapse of the network followed by recoveries. We argue that a graph theoretic classification of perturbations of the network is helpful in predicting the future impact of a perturbation over short and medium time scales.",2002-10-30T10:32:04Z,2002-10-30T10:32:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0210070v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0210070v1,nlin.AO

Generalized models as a universal approach to the analysis of nonlinear   dynamical systems,"Thilo Gross, Ulrike Feudel","We present a universal approach to the investigation of the dynamics in generalized models. In these models the processes that are taken into account are not restricted to specific functional forms. Therefore a single generalized models can describe a class of systems which share a similar structure. Despite this generality, the proposed approach allows us to study the dynamical properties of generalized models efficiently in the framework of local bifurcation theory. The approach is based on a normalization procedure that is used to identify natural parameters of the system. The Jacobian in a steady state is then derived as a function of these parameters. The analytical computation of local bifurcations using computer algebra reveals conditions for the local asymptotic stability of steady states and provides certain insights on the global dynamics of the system. The proposed approach yields a close connection between modelling and nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate the investigation of generalized models by considering examples from three different disciplines of science: a socio-economic model of dynastic cycles in china, a model for a coupled laser system and a general ecological food web.",2006-01-29T13:32:05Z,2006-01-29T13:32:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0601061v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0601061v1,nlin.CD

Finite size effects in the dynamics of opinion formation,"Raul Toral, Claudio J.

We discuss the conditions under which changes of behavior can appear only when the number of agents in the model takes a finite value. Those changes of behavior can be related to the apparent phase transitions that appear in some physical models. We show examples in the Galam's model of opinion transmission and the Axelrod's model of culture formation stressing the role that the network of interactions has on the main results of both models. Finally, we present the phenomenon of system-size stochastic resonance by which a forcing signal (identified as an advertising agent) is optimally amplified by a population of the right (intermediate) size.

Besides dramatically raising our perception of many natural phenomena, these concepts are opening up new vistas of applications and unfolding technologies: Optical soliton based information technology, magnetoelectronics, controlling and synchronization of chaos and secure communications, to name a few. These developments have raised further new interesting questions and potentialities.

Meta-nematic transitions in a bilayer system: Application to the bilayer   ruthenate,"Christoph Puetter, Hyeonjin Doh, Hae-Young Kee","It was suggested that the two consecutive metamagnetic transitions and the large residual resistivity discovered in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ can be understood via the nematic order and its domains in a single layer system. However, a recently reported anisotropy between two longitudinal resistivities induced by tilting the magnetic field away from the c-axis cannot be explained within the single layer nematic picture. To fill the gap in our understanding within the nematic order scenario, we investigate the effects of bilayer coupling and in-plane magnetic field on the electronic nematic phases in a bilayer system. We propose that the in-plane magnetic field in the bilayer system modifies the energetics of the domain formation, since it breaks the degeneracy of two different nematic orientations. Thus the system reveals a pure nematic phase with a resistivity anisotropy in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. In addition to the nematic phase, the bilayer coupling opens a novel route to a hidden nematic phase that preserves the x-y symmetry of the Fermi surfaces.",2007-06-07T20:41:46Z,2008-08-17T18:39:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1069v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.1069v3,"cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Symmetrised Characterisation of Noisy Quantum Processes,"Joseph Emerson, Marcus Silva, Osama Moussa, Colm Ryan, Martin Laforest, Jonathan Baugh, David G. Cory, Raymond Laflamme","A major goal of developing high-precision control of many-body quantum systems is to realise their potential as quantum computers. Probably the most significant obstacle in this direction is the problem of ""decoherence"": the extreme fragility of quantum systems to environmental noise and other control limitations. The theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction has shown that quantum computation is possible even in the presence of decoherence provided that the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain well-defined theoretical conditions. However, existing methods for noise characterisation have become intractable already for the systems that are controlled in today's labs. In this paper we introduce a technique based on symmetrisation that enables direct experimental characterisation of key properties of the decoherence affecting a multi-body quantum system. Our method reduces the number of experiments required by existing methods from exponential to polynomial in the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the application of this technique to the optimisation of control over nuclear spins in the solid state.",2007-07-04T19:55:30Z,2007-07-04T19:55:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0685v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.0685v1,quant-ph

The system is subjected to both temporal and spatiotemporal perturbations. Through the analysis of the system's time evolution and its time correlations, we have obtained numerical evidence for two stochastic resonance-like behaviors. Such behavior is seen when a generalized signal-to-noise ratio function are depicted as a function of the external noise intensity or as function of the system size.

The concept is illustrated in carbon systems, including polyacetylene and nano graphitic ribbons. Using density functional theory calculations for systems made of up to 400 atoms, we determine the flexoelectric coefficients to be of the order of ~ 0.1 e, in agreement with the prediction of linear theory.

The ability to obtain particle coordinates in bulk samples from micrographs is particularly appealing. In this paper we review and extend methods for optimal image formation of colloidal samples, which is vital for particle coordinates of the highest accuracy, and for extracting the most reliable coordinates from these images. We discuss in depth the accuracy of the coordinates, which is sensitive to the details of the colloidal system and the imaging system. Moreover, this accuracy can vary between particles, particularly in dense systems. We introduce a previously unreported error estimate and use it to develop an iterative method for finding particle coordinates. This individual-particle accuracy assessment also allows comparison between particle locations obtained from different experiments.

In some large systems with resource-constrained devices, such as sensor networks and RFID systems, the design is sensitive to memory or key storage cost. With a goal to minimize the maximum users' key storage, key compression based on key linking, that is, deriving one key from another without compromising security, is studied. A lower bound on key storage needed for a general access structure with key derivation is derived. This bound demonstrates the theoretic limit of any systems which do not trade off security and can be treated as a negative result to provide ground for designs with security tradeoff.

Our results indicate that the breakdown, in both the Peierls and Mott insulators, at thermodynamic limit, does not follow the Landau-Zener mechanism.

Universality behind Basquin's law of fatigue,"F. Kun, H. A. Carmona, J. S. Andrade Jr., H. J.

We show that in spite of the broad scatter of the Basquin exponent $\alpha$, the fatigue fracture of heterogeneous materials exhibits intriguing universal features. Based on stochastic fracture models we propose a generic scaling form for the macroscopic deformation and show that at the fatigue limit the system undergoes a continuous phase transition when changing the external load. On the microlevel, the fatigue fracture proceeds in bursts characterized by universal power law distributions. We demonstrate that in a range of systems, including deformation of asphalt, a realistic model of deformation, and a fiber bundle model, the system dependent details are contained in Basquin's exponent for time to failure, and once this is taken into account, remaining features of failure are universal.",2008-01-23T20:49:55Z,2008-01-23T20:49:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3664v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3664v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.dis-nn"

"Qtier-Rapor: Managing Spreadsheet Systems & Improving Corporate   Performance, Compliance and Governance",Keith Bishop,"Much of what EuSpRIG discusses is concerned with the integrity of individual spreadsheets. In businesses, interlocking spreadsheets are regularly used to fill functional gaps in core administrative systems. The growth and deployment of such integrated spreadsheet SYSTEMS raises the scale of issues to a whole new level. The correct management of spreadsheet systems is necessary to ensure that the business achieves its goals of improved performance and good corporate governance, within the constraints of legislative compliance - poor management will deliver the opposite. This paper is an anatomy of the real-life issues of the commercial use of spreadsheets in business, and demonstrates how Qtier-Rapor has been used to instil best practice in the use of integrated commercial spreadsheet systems.",2008-02-29T21:39:29Z,2008-02-29T21:39:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0011v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0011v1,"cs.OH, J.1; H.4.1; K.6.4; D.2.5; D.2.9; K.8.1"
Anisotropic interaction of two-level systems with acoustic waves in   disordered crystals,"Dragoş-Victor Anghel, Dmitry Churochkin","We apply the model introduced in Phys. Rev. B 75, 064202 (2007), cond-mat/0610469, to calculate the anisotropy effect in the interaction of two level systems with phonons in disordered crystals. We particularize our calculations to cubic crystals and compare them with the available experimental data to extract the parameters of the model. With these parameters we calculate the interaction of the dynamical defects in the disordered crystal with phonons (or sound waves) propagating along other crystalographic directions, providing in this way a method to investigate if the anisotropy comes from the two-level systems being preferably oriented in a certain direction or solely from the lattice anisotropy with the two-level systems being isotropically oriented.",2008-04-09T13:40:30Z,2008-04-09T13:40:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1481v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.1481v1,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Scattering of phonons on two-level systems in disordered crystals,"Dragoş-Victor Anghel, Dmitry Churochkin","We calculate the scattering rates of phonons on two-level systems in disordered trigonal and hexagonal crystals. We apply a model in which the two-level system, characterized by a direction in space, is coupled to the strain field of the phonon via a tensor of coupling constants. The structure of the tensor of coupling constants is similar to the structure of the tensor of elastic stiffness constants, in the sense that they are determined by the same symmetry transformations. In this way, we emphasize the anisotropy of the interaction of elastic waves with the ensemble of two-level systems in disordered crystals. We also point to the fact that the ratio $\gamma_l/\gamma_t$ has a much broader range of allowed values in disordered crystals than in isotropic solids.",2008-04-09T13:47:50Z,2008-08-21T09:13:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1486v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.1486v2,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"

The pseudogap was found to grow in size over a large region of the phase diagram of this system, finally leading to a metal-insulator transition. We have made a study comparing the near Fermi level behaviors of this system to those of a canonical double exchange system, namely, La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$. This study intends to highlight one of the important differences between the phase separated and double exchange colossal magnetoresistance systems in the nature of their energy gaps across the metal-insulator transitions. These differences could be ascribed to the distortions in the MnO$_6$ octahedra of their structures that regulate the localization of charge carriers.

Exact and approximate relations for the spin-dependence of the exchange   energy in high magnetic fields,"J. M. Morbec, K.

Within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), we show that the dependence of this functional on the four densities can be fully reconstructed from either of two extreme limits: a fully polarized system or a completely unpolarized system. Reconstruction from the limit of an unpolarized system yields a generalization of the Oliver-Perdew spin scaling relations from spin-DFT to current-DFT. Reconstruction from the limit of a fully polarized system is used to derive the high-field form of the local-spin-density approximation to current-DFT and to magnetic-field DFT.",2008-11-05T12:35:27Z,2008-11-05T12:35:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0714v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0714v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.other"

The primary difference between the models is the resolution of the computational lattice and, consequently, the intrinsic parameters that must be rescaled to retain similarity to the physical system. Considering the first-passage time to zero for the magnetization component in the longitudinal (easy-axis) direction, we look for applied fields that result in bimodal distributions of this time for each system and compare the results to the experimental system. We observe that the relevant fluctuations leading to bimodal distributions are different for each lattice resolution and result in magnetization-switching behavior that is unique to each computational model.

However, commercial systems are relatively expensive and the number of students in such a teaching-learning scenario is limited. ARSBO solves these problems.

On Constructor Rewrite Systems and the Lambda-Calculus (Long Version),"Ugo Dal Lago, Simone Martini","We prove that orthogonal constructor term rewrite systems and lambda-calculus with weak (i.e., no reduction is allowed under the scope of a lambda-abstraction) call-by-value reduction can simulate each other with a linear overhead. In particular, weak call-by-value beta-reduction can be simulated by an orthogonal constructor term rewrite system in the same number of reduction steps. Conversely, each reduction in a term rewrite system can be simulated by a constant number of beta-reduction steps. This is relevant to implicit computational complexity, because the number of beta steps to normal form is polynomially related to the actual cost (that is, as performed on a Turing machine) of normalization, under weak call-by-value reduction. Orthogonal constructor term rewrite systems and lambda-calculus are thus both polynomially related to Turing machines, taking as notion of cost their natural parameters.",2009-04-27T09:49:14Z,2012-08-02T15:16:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4120v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.4120v4,"cs.PL, cs.LO, F.1.1; F.4.1"

Different local order parameters are considered to obtain order parameter profiles for systems where the crystal phase is in coexistence with the fluid phase, separated by interfaces with (100) orientation of the crystal. From these profiles, the mean-squared interfacial width w^2 is extracted as a function of system size. We rationalize the prediction of capillary wave theory that w^2 diverges logarithmically with the lateral size of the system.

Information erasure lurking behind measures of complexity,"Karoline Wiesner, Mile Gu, Elisabeth Rieper, Vlatko Vedral","Complex systems are found in most branches of science. It is still argued how to best quantify their complexity and to what end. One prominent measure of complexity (the statistical complexity) has an operational meaning in terms of the amount of resources needed to forecasting a system's behaviour. Another one (the effective measure complexity, aka excess entropy) is a measure of mutual information stored in the system proper. We show that for any given system the two measures differ by the amount of information erased during forecasting. We interpret the difference as inefficiency of a given model. We find a bound to the ratio of the two measures defined as information-processing efficiency, in analogy to the second law of thermodynamics. This new link between two prominent measures of complexity provides a quantitative criterion for good models of complex systems, namely those with little information erasure.",2009-05-18T15:54:50Z,2011-10-21T09:24:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2918v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.2918v2,"physics.data-an, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.CC"
Discontinuity induced bifurcations of non-hyperbolic cycles in nonsmooth   systems,"Alessandro Colombo, Fabio Dercole","We analyse three codimension-two bifurcations occurring in nonsmooth systems, when a non-hyperbolic cycle (fold, flip, and Neimark-Sacker cases, both in continuous- and discrete-time) interacts with one of the discontinuity boundaries characterising the system's dynamics. Rather than aiming at a complete unfolding of the three cases, which would require specific assumptions on both the class of nonsmooth system and the geometry of the involved boundary, we concentrate on the geometric features that are common to all scenarios. We show that, at a generic intersection between the smooth and discontinuity induced bifurcation curves, a third curve generically emanates tangentially to the former. This is the discontinuity induced bifurcation curve of the secondary invariant set (the other cycle, the double-period cycle, or the torus, respectively) involved in the smooth bifurcation. The result can be explained intuitively, but its validity is proven here rigorously under very general conditions.

FTOS-Verify: Analysis and Verification of Non-Functional Properties for   Fault-Tolerant Systems,"Chih-Hong Cheng, Christian Buckl, Javier Esparza, Alois Knoll","The focus of the tool FTOS is to alleviate designers' burden by offering code generation for non-functional aspects including fault-tolerance mechanisms. One crucial aspect in this context is to ensure that user-selected mechanisms for the system model are sufficient to resist faults as specified in the underlying fault hypothesis. In this paper, formal approaches in verification are proposed to assist the claim. We first raise the precision of FTOS into pure mathematical constructs, and formulate the deterministic assumption, which is necessary as an extension of Giotto-like systems (e.g., FTOS) to equip with fault-tolerance abilities. We show that local properties of a system with the deterministic assumption will be preserved in a modified synchronous system used as the verification model. This enables the use of techniques known from hardware verification. As for implementation, we develop a prototype tool called FTOS-Verify, deploy it as an Eclipse add-on for FTOS, and conduct several case studies.",2009-05-25T06:11:42Z,2009-05-25T06:11:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3946v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.3946v1,"cs.DC, cs.LO"

Monroe (2009) recently gave a conjecture implying that such algorithm does not exist.   We show that in the presence of errors such optimal algorithms do exist. The concept is motivated by the notion of heuristic algorithms. Namely, we allow the algorithm to claim a small number of false ""theorems"" (according to any samplable distribution on non-tautologies) and err with bounded probability on other inputs.

Model-based specifications of a component-based system permit to explicitly model the structure and behaviour of components and their integration. In particular Software Architectures (SA) has been advocated as an effective means to produce quality systems. In this chapter by combining different technologies and tools for analysis and development, we propose an architecture-centric model-driven approach to validate required properties and to generate the system code. Functional requirements are elicited and used for identifying expected properties the architecture shall express. The architectural compliance to the properties is formally demonstrated, and the produced architectural model is used to automatically generate the Java code. Suitable transformations assure that the code is conforming to both structural and behavioural SA constraints.

Hancock","We have calculated the absorption characteristics of different hybrid systems consisting of Ag, Ag2 or Ag3 atomic clusters and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) using the time-dependent density-functional theory. The polymer is found to have an extensive structural-dependency on the spectral patterns of the hybrid systems relative to the bare clusters. The absorption spectrum can be `tuned' to the visible range for hybrid systems with an odd number of electrons per silver cluster, whereas for hybrid systems comprising an even number of electrons, the leading absorption edge can be shifted up to about 4.5 eV. The results give theoretical support to the experimental observations on the absorption in the visible range in metal cluster-polymer hybrid structures.",2010-03-10T19:45:35Z,2010-04-16T17:28:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2183v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2183v3,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Uncertainty and the Communication of Time,Loet Leydesdorff,"Prigogine and Stengers (1988) have pointed to the centrality of the concepts of ""time and eternity"" for the cosmology contained in Newtonian physics, but they have not addressed this issue beyond the domain of physics. The construction of ""time"" in the cosmology dates back to debates among Huygens, Newton, and Leibniz. The deconstruction of this cosmology in terms of the philosophical questions of the 17th century suggests an uncertainty in the time dimension. While order has been conceived as an ""harmonie pr\'e\'etablie"", it is considered as emergent from an evolutionary perspective. In a ""chaology"", one should fully appreciate that different systems may use different clocks. Communication systems can be considered as contingent in space and time: substances contain force or action, and they communicate not only in (observable) extension, but also over time. While each communication system can be considered as a system of reference for a special theory of communication, the addition of an evolutionary perspective to the mathematical theory of communication opens up the possibility of a general theory of communication.",2010-03-15T10:42:07Z,2010-03-15T10:42:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2884v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2884v1,"physics.hist-ph, physics.soc-ph"

Magnetic Scattering Chapter,"Jeffrey W.

Both techniques provide measurements as a function of the energy and the momentum transferred from the spin system to the probe particles, in terms of five-dimensional data sets as a function of various thermodynamic fields at the control of the experimenter. These scattering techniques yield fundamental information about the equal-time correlations such the magnetic configuration and symmetry, as well as the dynamics that determine the exchange interactions for prototypical systems that behave as linear, planar, or three-dimensional systems. Historically, neutron scattering has been the magnetic scattering technique of choice for such investigations, but the extraordinary advances in resonant x-ray scattering techniques have enable new types of magnetic scattering measurements. The type of information obtained with the two techniques is largely complementary and depends on the interests of the investigators.

Different types of ad slots are auctioned by the ad exchange, e.g., video ad, banner ad etc. We study repeated posted price auctions for homogeneous and heterogeneous items when there is an intermediary. In a posted price auction, the auctioneer sets a fixed reserve price. The buyer can accept the price and win the ad slot or reject the price.   We analyze the system from the auctioneer's perspective and show that the optimal reserve price is dynamic for heterogeneous items. We also investigate system from intermediary's perspective and devise algorithms for scheduling advertisers. Often the advertisers have budget constraints and impression constraints.

In this paper we first reformulate PNPF ($4N+6$ equations) into an evolutional system with $N+1$ equations, and define a new total electrical charge. We then prove the constant states are stable provided that they are such that the perturbed systems around them are dissipative. However, not all positive constant solutions of PNPF are such that the corresponding perturbed systems are dissipative.

Meanwhile, the so-called fracton is expected to appear in the nanoscale region owing to the self-similar structure of monomers in polymeric glasses. We demonstrate that such excitations can be detected using terahertz spectroscopy. For the interaction between terahertz light and the vibrational density of states of the fractal structure, we formulate an infrared light-vibration coupling coefficient for the fracton region. Accordingly, we show that information concerning fractal and fracton dimensions appears in the exponent of the absorption coefficient. Finally, using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and low-frequency Raman scattering, we experimentally observe these universal excitations in a protein lysozyme system that has an intrinsically disordered and self-similar nature in a single supramolecule.

Pricing Mechanism for Resource Sustainability in Competitive Online   Learning Multi-Agent Systems,"Ezra Tampubolon, Holger Boche","In this paper, we consider the problem of resource congestion control for competing online learning agents. On the basis of non-cooperative game as the model for the interaction between the agents, and the noisy online mirror ascent as the model for rational behavior of the agents, we propose a novel pricing mechanism which gives the agents incentives for sustainable use of the resources. Our mechanism is distributed and resource-centric, in the sense that it is done by the resources themselves and not by a centralized instance, and that it is based rather on the congestion state of the resources than the preferences of the agents. In case that the noise is persistent, and for several choices of the intrinsic parameter of the agents, such as their learning rate, and of the mechanism parameters, such as the learning rate of -, the progressivity of the price-setters, and the extrinsic price sensitivity of the agents, we show that the accumulative violation of the resource constraints of the resulted iterates is sub-linear w.r.t. the time horizon.

Magnetic phase diagram of the triangular antiferromagnetic   $Cs_2CuCl_{4-x}Br_x$ mixed system,"Natalija van Well, Oksana Zaharko, Bernard Delley, Markos Skoulatos, Robert Georgii, Sander van Smaalen, Christian Rüegg","The novel magnetic phase diagram of the $Cs_2CuCl_{4-x}Br_x$ mixed system is established by means of single crystal neutron diffraction in the lowest temperature region and zero magnetic field. Two long-range ordered magnetic phases exist in this mixed system depending on the Cl/Br concentration. In the rich Cl concentration range, the ordered magnetic state occurs below the ordering temperature $T_N = 0.51(1)K$ for $Cs_2CuCl_3Br_1$ and at $Cs_2CuCl_{2.6}Br_{1.4}$ below $T_N = 0.24(2)K$.

Between the rich Cl and rich Br concentration ranges (two magnetic phases), there is a range of x without magnetic order down to $50mK$. A suggestion about the magnetic exchange paths in the $bc$-layer for different regimes is presented, which can be controlled depending on the preferred Br-occupation in the [CuX4] tetrahedra.

Polynomial Probabilistic Invariants and the Optional Stopping Theorem,"Anne Schreuder, C. -H.

We construct invariants in the form of polynomials over program variables, which give rise to martingales. These polynomials are program invariants in the sense that their expected value upon termination is the same as their value at the start of the computation. In order to guarantee this we apply the Optional Stopping Theorem. Concretely, we present two approaches. The first is restricted to linear systems. In this case under positive almost sure termination there is a reduction to finding linear invariants for deterministic transition systems. Secondly, by exploiting geometric persistence properties we construct martingale invariants for general polynomial transition system.

We exploit the elemental abundances observed in six white dwarfs polluted by the accretion of rocky bodies to determine the fraction of oxidized iron in those extrasolar rocky bodies and therefore their oxygen fugacities.

Egoistic Incentives Based on Zero-Determinant Alliances for Large-Scale   Systems,"Shengling Wang, Peizi Ma, Qin Hu, Xiuzhen Cheng, Weifeng Lv","Social dilemmas exist in various fields and give rise to the so-called free-riding problem, leading to collective fiascos. The difficulty of tracking individual behaviors makes egoistic incentives in large-scale systems a challenging task. However, the state-of-the-art mechanisms are either individual-based or state-dependent, resulting in low efficiency in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose an egoistic incentive mechanism from a connected (network) perspective rather than an isolated (individual) perspective by taking advantage of the social nature of people. We make use of a zero-determinant (ZD) strategy for rewarding cooperation and sanctioning defection. After proving cooperation is the dominant strategy for ZD players, we optimize their deployment to facilitate cooperation over the whole system. To further speed up cooperation, we derive a ZD alliance strategy for sequential multiple-player repeated games to empower ZD players with higher controllable leverage, which undoubtedly enriches the theoretical system of ZD strategies and broadens their application domain. Our approach is stateless and stable, which contributes to its scalability.

Thinging-Oriented Modeling of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Sabah Al-Fedaghi, Jassim Al-Fadhli","In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in both practical and research applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). According to the literature, there is a need in this area to develop a more refined model of UAV system architecture, in other words, a conceptual model that defines the system s structure and behavior. The existing models mostly are fractional and do not account for the entire important dynamic attributes. Progress in this area could reduce ambiguity and increase reliability in the design of such systems. This paper aims to advance the modeling of UAV system architecture by adopting a conceptual model called a thinging (abstract) machine in which all of the UAV s software and hardware components are viewed in terms of the flow of things and five generic operations. We apply this model to a real case study of a drone. The results, an integrated conceptual representation of the drone, support the viability of this approach.",2020-05-30T21:21:11Z,2020-05-30T21:21:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00369v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00369v1,"cs.SE, cs.RO"
Cryopumping and Vacuum Systems,Vincent Baglin,"The understanding of complex and/or large vacuum systems operating at cryogenic temperatures requires a specific knowledge of the vacuum science at such temperatures. At room temperature, molecules with a low binding energy to a surface are not pumped. However, at cryogenic temperatures, their sojourn time is significantly increased, thanks to the temperature reduction, which allow a ""cryopumping"". This lecture gives an introduction to the field of cryogenic vacuum, discussing surface desorption, sticking probability, thermal transpiration, adsorption isotherms, vapour pressure of usual gases, industrial surfaces and roughness factors. These aspects are illustrated with the case of the Large Hardon Collider explaining its beam screen and its cryosorber, leaks and beam vacuum system modelling in a cryogenic environment. Finally, operation of cryogenic beam vacuum systems is discussed for LHC and other cryogenic machines.",2020-06-02T12:52:35Z,2020-06-02T12:52:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01574v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01574v1,"physics.ins-det, physics.acc-ph"
Aerial Manipulation Using Hybrid Force and Position NMPC Applied to   Aerial Writing,"Dimos Tzoumanikas, Felix Graule, Qingyue Yan, Dhruv Shah, Marija Popovic, Stefan Leutenegger","Aerial manipulation aims at combining the manoeuvrability of aerial vehicles with the manipulation capabilities of robotic arms. This, however, comes at the cost of the additional control complexity due to the coupling of the dynamics of the two systems. In this paper we present a NMPC specifically designed for MAVs equipped with a robotic arm. We formulate a hybrid control model for the combined MAV-arm system which incorporates interaction forces acting on the end effector. We explain the practical implementation of our algorithm and show extensive experimental results of our custom built system performing multiple aerial-writing tasks on a whiteboard, revealing accuracy in the order of millimetres.",2020-06-03T09:15:29Z,2020-06-03T09:15:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02116v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02116v1,cs.RO
High-Entropy Oxides Based on Valence Combinations: Design and Practice,"Lei Tang, Zemin Li, Kepi Chen, Cuiwei Li, Xiaowen Zhang, Linan An","High-entropy oxides (HEOs) are a new class of materials that are promising for a wide range of applications. Designing HEOs needs to consider both geometric compatibility and electrical equilibrium. However, there is currently no available method to systematically consider these two factors when selecting constituent materials for making HEOs. Here we propose a two-step strategy, where a HEO system to be explored is first partitioned into multiple subsystems based on the valence combinations of substituted cations; the geometric compatibility is then considered in selecting suitable substituted cations. We demonstrate this strategy by using A(5B0.2)O3 perovskite as a model system. We show that the system can be partitioned into 12 subsystems. Ten of the subsystems have formed a single-phase cubic perovskite, while two have partially ordering structure. The formation of single phases is correlated to Goldschmidt's tolerance factor, while the formation of the ordering structure is mainly correlated to cation-valence difference. We anticipate that this strategy is applicable to exploring HEOs in other systems.",2020-06-06T10:27:40Z,2020-06-06T10:27:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03834v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03834v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Minimizing Deduction System and its Application,"Zhe Cen, Xiutao Feng, Zhangyi Wang, Chunping Cao","In a deduction system with some propositions and some known relations among these propositions, people usually care about the minimum of propositions by which all other propositions can be deduced according to these known relations. Here we call it a minimizing deduction system. Its common solution is the guess and determine method. In this paper we propose a method of solving the minimizing deduction system based on MILP. Firstly, we introduce the conceptions of state variable, path variable and state copy, which enable us to characterize all rules by inequalities. Then we reduce the deduction problem to a MILP problem and solve it by the Gurobi optimizer. As its applications, we analyze the security of two stream ciphers SNOW2.0 and Enocoro-128v2 in resistance to guess and determine attacks. For SNOW 2.0, it is surprising that it takes less than 0.1s to get the best solution of 9 known variables in a personal Macbook Air(Early 2015, Double Intel Core i5 1.6GHZ, 4GB DDR3). For Enocoro-128v2, we get the best solution of 18 known variables within 3 minutes.

Dependency of Sliding Friction for Two Dimensional Systems on   Electronegativity,"Jianjun Wang, Avinash Tiwari, Yang Huang, Yu Jia, B. N. J. Persson","We study the role of electronegativity in sliding friction for five different two dimensional (2D) monolayer systems using density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals (vdW) corrections. We show that the friction between the commensurate 2D layered systems depends strongly on the electronegativity difference of the involved atoms. All the 2D layered structures exhibit almost the same magnitude of friction force when sliding along the nonpolar path, independent of the material and the surface structures. In contrast, for sliding friction along the polar path, the friction force obeys a universal linear scaling law as a function of the electronegativity difference of its constituent atoms. Further analyses demonstrate that atomic dipoles in the 2D monolayers induced by the electronegativity difference enhance the corrugation of charge distribution and increase the sliding barrier accordingly. Our studies reveal that electronegativity plays an important role in friction of low dimensional systems, and will provide a strategy for designing nanoscale devices further.",2020-06-14T14:20:45Z,2020-06-14T14:20:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07910v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07910v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

Stabilization of one-dimensional Townes solitons by spin-orbit coupling   in a dual-core system,"Elad Shamriz, Zhaopin Chen, Boris A. Malomed","It was recently demonstrated that two-dimensional Townes solitons (TSs) in two-component systems with cubic self-focusing, which are normally made unstable by the critical collapse, can be stabilized by linear spin-orbit coupling (SOC), in Bose-Einstein condensates and optics alike. We demonstrate that one-dimensional TSs, realized as optical spatial solitons in a planar dual-core waveguide with dominant quintic self-focusing, may be stabilized by SOC-like terms emulated by obliquity of the coupling between cores of the waveguide. Thus, SOC offers a universal mechanism for the stabilization of the TSs. A combination of systematic numerical considerations and analytical approximations identifies a vast stability area for skew-symmetric solitons in the system's main (semi-infinite) and annex (finite) bandgaps. Tilted (""moving"") solitons are unstable, spontaneously evolving into robust breathers. For broad solitons, diffraction, represented by second derivatives in the system, may be neglected, leading to a simplified model with a finite bandgap. It is populated by skew-antisymmetric gap solitons, which are nearly stable close to the gap's bottom.",2020-06-16T22:56:51Z,2020-06-16T22:56:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09555v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09555v1,"nlin.PS, cond-mat.quant-gas, physics.optics"
Identifying candidate hosts for quantum defects via data mining,"Austin M. Ferrenti, Nathalie P. de Leon, Jeff D. Thompson, R. J.

Here we systematically evaluate the suitability of host materials by applying a combined four-stage data mining and manual screening process to all entries in the Materials Project database, with literature-based experimental confirmation of band gap values. We identify 580 viable host substrates for quantum defect introduction and use in quantum information systems. While this constitutes a significant increase in the number of known and potentially viable material systems, it nonetheless represents a significant (99.54%) reduction from the total number of known inorganic phases, and the application of additional selection criteria for specific applications will reduce their number even further. The screening principles outlined may easily be applied to previously unrealized phases and other technologically important materials systems.",2020-06-25T01:20:03Z,2020-06-25T01:20:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14128v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14128v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Explosive Synchronization in Multilayer Dynamically Dissimilar Networks,"Sarika Jalan, Ajay Deep Kachhvah, Hawoong Jeong","The phenomenon of explosive synchronization, which originates from hypersensitivity to small perturbation caused by some form of frustration prevailed in various physical and biological systems, has been shown to lead events of cascading failure of the power grid to chronic pain or epileptic seizure in the brain. Furthermore, networks provide a powerful model to understand and predict the properties of a diverse range of real-world complex systems. Recently, a multilayer network has been realized as a better suited framework for the representation of complex systems having multiple types of interactions among the same set of constituents. This article shows that by tuning the properties of one layer (network) of a multilayer network, one can regulate the dynamical behavior of another layer (network). By taking an example of a multiplex network comprising two different types of networked Kuramoto oscillators representing two different layers, this article attempts to provide a glimpse of opportunities and emerging phenomena multiplexing can induce which is otherwise not possible for a network in isolation. Here we consider explosive synchronization to demonstrate the potential of multilayer networks framework.

Finite Element Network Analysis: A Machine Learning based Computational   Framework for the Simulation of Physical Systems,"Mehdi Jokar, Fabio Semperlotti","This study introduces the concept of finite element network analysis (FENA) which is a physics-informed, machine-learning-based, computational framework for the simulation of complex physical systems. The framework leverages the extreme computational speed of trained neural networks and the unique transfer knowledge property of bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) to provide a uniquely powerful and flexible computing platform. One of the most remarkable properties of this framework consists in its ability to simulate the response of complex systems, made of multiple interconnected components, by combining individually pre-trained network models that do not require any further training following the assembly phase. This remarkable result is achieved via the use of key concepts such as transfer knowledge and network concatenation. Although the computational framework is illustrated and numerically validated for the case of a mechanical system under static loading, the conceptual structure of the framework has broad applicability and could be extended to the most diverse field of computational science. The framework is numerically validated against the solution provided by traditional finite element analysis and the results highlight the outstanding performance of this new concept of computational platform.",2020-08-17T11:38:24Z,2021-02-19T04:23:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07229v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07229v2,physics.comp-ph

As in the original case, the convergence robust exact filtering differentiator depends on the bound of a higher-order derivative; nevertheless, this new realization can be implemented with or without the knowledge of such constant.

Can scaling analysis be used to interpret the anti-parity-time symmetry   in heat transfer?,"Ying Li, Wei Li, Cheng-Wei Qiu","In a previous work (Li et al. Science 364, 170) [1], we proposed a heat transfer system that preserves the anti-parity-time (APT) symmetry, and observe the rest-to-motion phase transition during the symmetry breaking. Recently, it was suggested (Zhao et al. arXiv:1906.08431) [2] that the behaviours of the system can be understood using scaling analysis based on the P\'eclet and Nusselt numbers (Pe and Nu). It was further proposed that there exists a third regime in the phase diagram in addition to the symmetric and symmetry broken phases. Although we appreciate the proposal to characterize the contributions of coupling, diffusion, and advection with dimensionless numbers, here we show that they do not help to predict or interpret the behaviours of the APT system. The dimensionless numbers do not provide enough details about the system to conclude that there is a motionless phase, a phase transition, to find the critical point, or to give the correct phase diagram with only two regimes.",2020-08-21T15:21:12Z,2020-08-21T15:21:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10990v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10990v1,physics.flu-dyn
Global Stability and Periodicity in a Glucose-Insulin Regulation Model   with a Single Delay,"M. Angelova, G. Beliakov, A. Ivanov, S.

Sufficient conditions are derived for the unique positive equilibrium in the system to be globally asymptotically stable. They are given in terms of the global attractivity of the fixed point in a limiting interval map. The existence of slowly oscillating periodic solutions is shown in the case when the equilibrium is unstable. The mathematical results are supported by extensive numerical simulations. It is shown that typical behaviour in the system is the convergence to either a stable periodic solution or to the unique stable equilibrium.

Coordinated Online Learning for Multi-Agent Systems with Coupled   Constraints and Perturbed Utility Observations,"Ezra Tampubolon, Holger Boche","Competitive non-cooperative online decision-making agents whose actions increase congestion of scarce resources constitute a model for widespread modern large-scale applications. To ensure sustainable resource behavior, we introduce a novel method to steer the agents toward a stable population state, fulfilling the given coupled resource constraints. The proposed method is a decentralized resource pricing method based on the resource loads resulting from the augmentation of the game's Lagrangian. Assuming that the online learning agents have only noisy first-order utility feedback, we show that for a polynomially decaying agents' step size/learning rate, the population's dynamic will almost surely converge to generalized Nash equilibrium. A particular consequence of the latter is the fulfillment of resource constraints in the asymptotic limit. Moreover, we investigate the finite-time quality of the proposed algorithm by giving a nonasymptotic time decaying bound for the expected amount of resource constraint violation.",2020-10-21T10:11:17Z,2020-10-21T10:11:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10878v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10878v1,"math.OC, cs.GT, cs.LG, cs.MA, cs.SY, eess.SY"
On Information Asymmetry in Competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement   Learning: Convergence and Optimality,"Ezra Tampubolon, Haris Ceribasic, Holger Boche","In this work, we study the system of interacting non-cooperative two Q-learning agents, where one agent has the privilege of observing the other's actions. We show that this information asymmetry can lead to a stable outcome of population learning, which generally does not occur in an environment of general independent learners. The resulting post-learning policies are almost optimal in the underlying game sense, i.e., they form a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we propose in this work a Q-learning algorithm, requiring predictive observation of two subsequent opponent's actions, yielding an optimal strategy given that the latter applies a stationary strategy, and discuss the existence of the Nash equilibrium in the underlying information asymmetrical game.",2020-10-21T11:19:53Z,2021-01-22T22:18:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10901v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10901v2,"cs.LG, cs.GT, cs.MA, cs.SY, econ.TH, eess.SY"

Towards Compositional Verification for Modular Robotic Systems,"Rafael C. Cardoso, Louise A. Dennis, Marie Farrell, Michael Fisher, Matt Luckcuck","Software engineering of modular robotic systems is a challenging task, however, verifying that the developed components all behave as they should individually and as a whole presents its own unique set of challenges. In particular, distinct components in a modular robotic system often require different verification techniques to ensure that they behave as expected. Ensuring whole system consistency when individual components are verified using a variety of techniques and formalisms is difficult. This paper discusses how to use compositional verification to integrate the various verification techniques that are applied to modular robotic software, using a First-Order Logic (FOL) contract that captures each component's assumptions and guarantees. These contracts can then be used to guide the verification of the individual components, be it by testing or the use of a formal method. We provide an illustrative example of an autonomous robot used in remote inspection. We also discuss a way of defining confidence for the verification associated with each component.",2020-12-03T02:21:51Z,2020-12-03T02:21:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01648v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01648v1,"cs.SE, cs.LO, cs.RO"
Generate and Verify: Semantically Meaningful Formal Analysis of Neural   Network Perception Systems,"Chris R. Serrano, Pape M. Sylla, Michael A. Warren","Testing remains the primary method to evaluate the accuracy of neural network perception systems. Prior work on the formal verification of neural network perception models has been limited to notions of local adversarial robustness for classification with respect to individual image inputs. In this work, we propose a notion of global correctness for neural network perception models performing regression with respect to a generative neural network with a semantically meaningful latent space. That is, against an infinite set of images produced by a generative model over an interval of its latent space, we employ neural network verification to prove that the model will always produce estimates within some error bound of the ground truth. Where the perception model fails, we obtain semantically meaningful counter-examples which carry information on concrete states of the system of interest that can be used programmatically without human inspection of corresponding generated images. Our approach, Generate and Verify, provides a new technique to gather insight into the failure cases of neural network perception systems and provide meaningful guarantees of correct behavior in safety critical applications.",2020-12-16T23:09:53Z,2020-12-16T23:09:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09313v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09313v1,"cs.LG, cs.LO, I.4.m; I.5.m"
Breaking Space Inversion-Symmetry to Obtain Asymmetric Spin-Wave   Excitation in Systems with Nonuniform Magnetic Exchange,"Rair Macêdo, Arjun S. Kudinoor, Karen L. Livesey, Robert E.

The quantum mechanical exchange interaction between spins is responsible for the phenomenon of magnetic order, and is generally considered to be uniform across bulk magnetic systems. Partly inspired by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction--also known as antisymmetric exchange--we use a linearly varying exchange interaction along a magnetic strip as a route to spatial inversion symmetry-breaking. We find that, in addition to asymmetric modes and localization, spatially-varying exchange can be used to design nonreciprocal magnetic signal excitation at frequencies that are tunable. Moreover, our work predicts nonreciprocity to occur across a vast range of frequencies up to hundreds of GHz. Such spin wave engineering is a key area of ongoing research in the fields of magnonics and spintronics, which are expected to enable the next generation of communication technology.

Simple three-stage frequency-stabilized diode laser system using   injection-locking and tapered amplifier,"J. Szonert, M. Głódź, K.

Slave amplifies the frequency-shifted beam and suppresses (within 0.5%) the strong dependence of its intensity on the AOM carrier frequency, thus acting as an efficient optical limiter. The beam is further amplified in TA. System operates at 780 nm, with an output power above 700 mW, a time-averaged linewidth of 0.6 MHz, and a frequency drift below 2 MHz/h. The mode-hop-free tuning range of the master amounts 2 GHz, DAVLL allows a lock point tunability in the range of 400 MHz.

SEH: Size Estimate Hedging for Single-Server Queues,"Maryam Akbari-Moghaddam, Douglas G. Down","For a single server system, Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) is an optimal size-based policy. In this paper, we discuss scheduling a single-server system when exact information about the jobs' processing times is not available. When the SRPT policy uses estimated processing times, the underestimation of large jobs can significantly degrade performance. We propose a simple heuristic, Size Estimate Hedging (SEH), that only uses estimated processing times for scheduling decisions. A job's priority is increased dynamically according to an SRPT rule until it is determined that it is underestimated, at which time the priority is frozen.

This may lead to some unwanted chattering effects than may damage the system. This behavior is difficult to observe even in simulation. In this paper, we propose an interval approach to characterize the sliding surface which corresponds to the set of all states such that the state trajectory may jump indefinitely between two distinct behaviors. We show that the recent notion of thick sets will allows us to compute efficiently an outer approximation of the sliding surface of a given class of hybrid system taking into account all set-membership uncertainties.

Further, this type system is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving types for the $T$-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states.

Interference Alignment Using Reaction in Molecular Interference Channels,"Maryam Farahnak-Ghazani, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari","Co-channel interference (CCI) is a performance limiting factor in molecular communication (MC) systems with shared medium. Interference alignment (IA) is a promising scheme to mitigate CCI in traditional communication systems. Due to the signal-dependent noise in MC systems, the traditional IA schemes are less useful in MC systems. In this paper, we propose a novel IA scheme in molecular interference channels (IFCs), based on the choice of releasing/sampling times. To cancel the aligned interference signals and reduce the signal dependent noise, we use molecular reaction in the proposed IA scheme. We obtain the feasible region for the releasing/sampling times in the proposed scheme. Further, we investigate the error performance of the proposed scheme. Our results show that the proposed IA scheme using reaction improves the performance significantly.\blfootnote{This work was supported in part by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) Research Grant on Nano-Network Communications and in part by the Research Center of Sharif University of Technology.",2021-01-26T12:34:51Z,2022-06-26T18:15:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10745v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10745v2,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Inadequacy of Linear Methods for Minimal Sensor Placement and Feature   Selection in Nonlinear Systems; a New Approach Using Secants,"Samuel E. Otto, Clarence W. Rowley","Sensor placement and feature selection are critical steps in engineering, modeling, and data science that share a common mathematical theme: the selected measurements should enable solution of an inverse problem. Most real-world systems of interest are nonlinear, yet the majority of available techniques for feature selection and sensor placement rely on assumptions of linearity or simple statistical models. We show that when these assumptions are violated, standard techniques can lead to costly over-sensing without guaranteeing that the desired information can be recovered from the measurements. In order to remedy these problems, we introduce a novel data-driven approach for sensor placement and feature selection for a general type of nonlinear inverse problem based on the information contained in secant vectors between data points. Using the secant-based approach, we develop three efficient greedy algorithms that each provide different types of robust, near-minimal reconstruction guarantees. We demonstrate them on two problems where linear techniques consistently fail: sensor placement to reconstruct a fluid flow formed by a complicated shock-mixing layer interaction and selecting fundamental manifold learning coordinates on a torus.",2021-01-27T01:57:34Z,2021-01-27T01:57:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11162v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11162v1,"math.OC, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.ML"

Annealing at 200 {\deg}C, well below the growth temperature, does not significantly affect the already-low internal friction or the sound velocity, but irreversibly reduces the non-Debye specific heat by an order of magnitude at 2 K, indicating a large reduction of the density of two-level systems. Comparison of the specific heat to the internal friction suggests that the two-level systems are uncharacteristically decoupled from acoustic waves, both before and after annealing.

Here we show that dislocation lattice defects are immune to such skin effect or at most display a \emph{weak} skin effect (depending on its relative orientation with the Burgers vector), and as such they support robust topological modes in the bulk of a NH system, specifically when the parent Hermitian phase features band inversion at a finite momentum. However, the dislocation modes gradually lose their support at their core when the system approaches an exceptional point, and finally melt into the boundary of the system across the NH band gap closing. We explicitly demonstrate these findings for a two-dimensional NH Chern insulator, thereby establishing that dislocation lattice defects can be instrumental to experimentally probe pristine NH topology.",2021-05-11T17:59:33Z,2022-07-12T18:10:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05244v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05244v3,"cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, quant-ph"

Robust optimal policies for team Markov games,"Feng Huang, Ming Cao, Long Wang","In stochastic dynamic environments, team Markov games have emerged as a versatile paradigm for studying sequential decision-making problems of fully cooperative multi-agent systems. However, the optimality of the derived policies is usually sensitive to model parameters, which are typically unknown and required to be estimated from noisy data in practice. To mitigate the sensitivity of optimal policies to these uncertain parameters, we propose a robust model of team Markov games in this paper, where agents utilize robust optimization approaches to update strategies. This model extends team Markov games to the scenario of incomplete information and meanwhile provides an alternative solution concept of robust team optimality. To seek such a solution, we develop a robust iterative learning algorithm of team policies and prove its convergence. This algorithm, compared with robust dynamic programming, not only possesses a faster convergence rate, but also allows for using approximation calculations to alleviate the curse of dimensionality.

GF magnets have, like all solid-state systems, randomly located impurities whose magnetic moments may ``freeze'' at low temperatures, making the system enter a spin-glass state. We analyse the available data for spin-glass transitions in GF materials and find a surprising trend: the glass-transition temperature grows with decreasing impurity concentration and reaches a finite value in the impurity-free limit at a previously unidentified, ``hidden'', energy scale. We propose a scenario in which the interplay of interactions and entropy leads to a crossover in the permeability of the medium that assists glass freezing at low temperatures.

In the nonintegrable domain, the system exhibits crossovers. Depending on the parameters and quantities, the quantum-classical correspondence holds for very few bosons. In some parameter regions, the ground state is robust (highly sensitive) to changes in the interaction strength (tilt amplitude), which may be of use for quantum information protocols (quantum sensing).",2021-05-21T18:00:13Z,2021-10-12T14:30:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10515v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10515v3,"quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas"
Hybrid Movie Recommender System based on Resource Allocation,"Mostafa Khalaji, Chitra Dadkhah, Joobin Gharibshah","Recommender Systems are inevitable to personalize user's experiences on the Internet. They are using different approaches to recommend the Top-K items to users according to their preferences. Nowadays recommender systems have become one of the most important parts of largescale data mining techniques. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Movie Recommender System (HMRS) based on Resource Allocation to improve the accuracy of recommendation and solve the cold start problem for a new movie. HMRS-RA uses a self-organizing mapping neural network to clustering the users into N clusters. The users' preferences are different according to their age and gender, therefore HMRS-RA is a combination of a Content-Based Method for solving the cold start problem for a new movie and a Collaborative Filtering model besides the demographic information of users. The experimental results based on the MovieLens dataset show that the HMRS-RA increases the accuracy of recommendation compared to the state-of-art and similar works.",2021-05-25T05:31:04Z,2021-05-25T05:31:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11678v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11678v1,cs.IR
Runtime Monitoring for Markov Decision Processes,"Sebastian Junges, Hazem Torfah, Sanjit A. Seshia","We investigate the problem of monitoring partially observable systems with nondeterministic and probabilistic dynamics. In such systems, every state may be associated with a risk, e.g., the probability of an imminent crash. During runtime, we obtain partial information about the system state in form of observations. The monitor uses this information to estimate the risk of the (unobservable) current system state. Our results are threefold. First, we show that extensions of state estimation approaches do not scale due the combination of nondeterminism and probabilities. While convex hull algorithms improve the practical runtime, they do not prevent an exponential memory blowup. Second, we present a tractable algorithm based on model checking conditional reachability probabilities. Third, we provide prototypical implementations and manifest the applicability of our algorithms to a range of benchmarks. The results highlight the possibilities and boundaries of our novel algorithms.",2021-05-26T04:26:28Z,2021-05-26T04:26:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12322v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12322v1,"cs.LO, cs.RO"
Enhancing the performance of a bistable energy harvesting device via the   cross-entropy method,Americo Cunha Jr,"This work deals with the solution of a non-convex optimization problem to enhance the performance of an energy harvesting device, which involves a nonlinear objective function and a discontinuous constraint. This optimization problem, which seeks to find a suitable configuration of parameters that maximize the electrical power recovered by a bistable energy harvesting system, is formulated in terms of the dynamical system response and a binary classifier obtained from 0 to 1 test for chaos. A stochastic solution strategy that combines penalization and the cross-entropy method is proposed and numerically tested. Computational experiments are conducted to address the performance of the proposed optimization approach by comparison with a reference solution, obtained via an exhaustive search in a refined numerical mesh. The obtained results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the cross-entropy optimization strategy (even in the presence of noise or in moderately higher dimensions), showing that the proposed framework may be a very useful and powerful tool to solve optimization problems involving nonlinear energy harvesting dynamical systems.",2021-05-27T21:47:20Z,2021-05-27T21:47:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13459v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13459v1,"cs.CE, math.DS, nlin.CD, physics.comp-ph, 37N15, J.2"
On-site Online Feature Selection for Classification of Switchgear   Actuations,"Christina Nicolaou, Ahmad Mansour, Kristof Van Laerhoven","As connected sensors continue to evolve, interest in low-voltage monitoring solutions is increasing. This also applies in the area of switchgear monitoring, where the detection of switch actions, their differentiation and aging are of fundamental interest. In particular, the universal applicability for various types of construction plays a major role. Methods in which design-specific features are learned in an offline training are therefore less suitable for assessing the condition of switchgears. A new computational efficient method for intelligent online feature selection is presented, which can be used to train a model for the addressed use cases on-site. Process- and design-specific features can be learned locally (e.g. on a sensor system) without the need of prior offline training. The proposed method is evaluated on four datasets of switchgear measurements, which were recorded using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based sensors (acoustic and vibration). Furthermore, we show that the features selected by our method can be used to track changes in switching processes due to aging effects.",2021-05-28T07:35:55Z,2021-05-28T07:35:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13639v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13639v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Learning Approximate and Exact Numeral Systems via Reinforcement   Learning,"Emil Carlsson, Devdatt Dubhashi, Fredrik D. Johansson","Recent work (Xu et al., 2020) has suggested that numeral systems in different languages are shaped by a functional need for efficient communication in an information-theoretic sense. Here we take a learning-theoretic approach and show how efficient communication emerges via reinforcement learning. In our framework, two artificial agents play a Lewis signaling game where the goal is to convey a numeral concept. The agents gradually learn to communicate using reinforcement learning and the resulting numeral systems are shown to be efficient in the information-theoretic framework of Regier et al. (2015); Gibson et al. (2017). They are also shown to be similar to human numeral systems of same type. Our results thus provide a mechanistic explanation via reinforcement learning of the recent results in Xu et al.

Indeed, choosing the best thermal protocol to reach a desired temperature or energy is not a trivial task. Noticeably, we find that the phase transitions may speed up thermalization in systems where there are no conserved quantities. In particular, we show that the slow growth of magnetic domains shortens the overall time that the system takes to reach a final desired state.

Temporal Prophecy for Proving Temporal Properties of Infinite-State   Systems,"Oded Padon, Jochen Hoenicke, Kenneth L. McMillan, Andreas Podelski, Mooly Sagiv, Sharon Shoham","Various verification techniques for temporal properties transform temporal verification to safety verification. For infinite-state systems, these transformations are inherently imprecise. That is, for some instances, the temporal property holds, but the resulting safety property does not. This paper introduces a mechanism for tackling this imprecision. This mechanism, which we call temporal prophecy, is inspired by prophecy variables. Temporal prophecy refines an infinite-state system using first-order linear temporal logic formulas, via a suitable tableau construction. For a specific liveness-to-safety transformation based on first-order logic, we show that using temporal prophecy strictly increases the precision. Furthermore, temporal prophecy leads to robustness of the proof method, which is manifested by a cut elimination theorem. We integrate our approach into the Ivy deductive verification system, and show that it can handle challenging temporal verification examples.",2021-06-02T06:26:29Z,2021-06-02T06:26:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00966v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00966v1,cs.LO

Optimizing Rankings for Recommendation in Matching Markets,"Yi Su, Magd Bayoumi, Thorsten Joachims","Based on the success of recommender systems in e-commerce, there is growing interest in their use in matching markets (e.g., labor). While this holds potential for improving market fluidity and fairness, we show in this paper that naively applying existing recommender systems to matching markets is sub-optimal. Considering the standard process where candidates apply and then get evaluated by employers, we present a new recommendation framework to model this interaction mechanism and propose efficient algorithms for computing personalized rankings in this setting. We show that the optimal rankings need to not only account for the potentially divergent preferences of candidates and employers, but they also need to account for capacity constraints. This makes conventional ranking systems that merely rank by some local score (e.g., one-sided or reciprocal relevance) highly sub-optimal -- not only for an individual user, but also for societal goals (e.g., low unemployment). To address this shortcoming, we propose the first method for jointly optimizing the rankings for all candidates in the market to explicitly maximize social welfare. In addition to the theoretical derivation, we evaluate the method both on simulated environments and on data from a real-world networking-recommendation system that we built and fielded at a large computer science conference.",2021-06-03T15:46:02Z,2021-06-03T15:46:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01941v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01941v1,cs.IR
Extracting Dynamical Frequencies from Invariants of Motion in   Finite-Dimensional Nonlinear Integrable Systems,"Chad E. Mitchell, Robert D. Ryne, Kilean Hwang, Sergei Nagaitsev, Timofey Zolkin","Integrable dynamical systems play an important role in many areas of science, including accelerator and plasma physics. An integrable dynamical system with $n$ degrees of freedom (DOF) possesses $n$ nontrivial integrals of motion, and can be solved, in principle, by covering the phase space with one or more charts in which the dynamics can be described using action-angle coordinates. To obtain the frequencies of motion, both the transformation to action-angle coordinates and its inverse must be known in explicit form. However, no general algorithm exists for constructing this transformation explicitly from a set of $n$ known (and generally coupled) integrals of motion. In this paper we describe how one can determine the dynamical frequencies of the motion as functions of these $n$ integrals in the absence of explicitly-known action-angle variables, and we provide several examples.",2021-06-04T17:39:30Z,2021-06-10T20:50:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02625v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02625v2,"physics.acc-ph, math-ph, math.MP, nlin.SI"

The protocol was used by the LFC team in the 2019 edition of the Multi-Agent Programming Contest (MAPC). Our specification of the protocol is written in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), which is a well-suited approach to specifying agent communication protocols due to its focus on concurrent communicating systems.

IoT Solution for Winter Survival of Indoor Plants,"Md Saroar Jahan, Jhuma kabir Mim, Sampo Niittyviita, Santeri Moberg, Murad Ahmad, Nijar Hossain","Not only does cold climate pose a problem for outdoor plants during winter in the northern hemisphere, but for indoor plants as well: low sunlight, low humidity, and simultaneous cold breezes from windows and heat from radiators all cause problems for indoor plants. People often treat their indoor plants like mere decoration, which can often lead to health issues for the plant or even death of the plant, especially during winter. A plant monitoring system was developed to solve this problem, collecting information on plants' indoor environmental conditions (light, humidity, and temperature) and providing this information in an accessible format for the user. Preliminary functional tests were conducted in similar settings where the system would be used. In addition, the concept was evaluated by interviewing an expert in the field of horticulture.

Integrated information as a common signature of dynamical and   information-processing complexity,"Pedro A. M. Mediano, Fernando E. Rosas, Juan Carlos Farah, Murray Shanahan, Daniel Bor, Adam B. Barrett","The apparent dichotomy between information-processing and dynamical approaches to complexity science forces researchers to choose between two diverging sets of tools and explanations, creating conflict and often hindering scientific progress. Nonetheless, given the shared theoretical goals between both approaches, it is reasonable to conjecture the existence of underlying common signatures that capture interesting behaviour in both dynamical and information-processing systems. Here we argue that a pragmatic use of Integrated Information Theory (IIT), originally conceived in theoretical neuroscience, can provide a potential unifying framework to study complexity in general multivariate systems. Furthermore, by leveraging metrics put forward by the integrated information decomposition ($\Phi$ID) framework, our results reveal that integrated information can effectively capture surprisingly heterogeneous signatures of complexity -- including metastability and criticality in networks of coupled oscillators as well as distributed computation and emergent stable particles in cellular automata -- without relying on idiosyncratic, ad-hoc criteria.

In this work, we consider a data-driven method to extract stochastic dynamical systems with non-Gaussian asymmetric (rather than the symmetric) L\'evy process, as well as Gaussian Brownian motion. We establish a theoretical framework and design a numerical algorithm to compute the asymmetric L\'evy jump measure, drift and diffusion (i.e., nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas), hence obtaining the stochastic governing law, from noisy data. Numerical experiments on several prototypical examples confirm the efficacy and accuracy of this method. This method will become an effective tool in discovering the governing laws from available data sets and in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex random phenomena.",2021-07-21T14:50:36Z,2021-07-21T14:50:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10127v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10127v1,"math.ST, stat.ML, stat.TH"
A Design Study on Adaptive Primaries for 1-2 Meter Class Telescopes,"J. Fowler, Rachel Bowens-Rubin, Philip M. Hinz","Adaptive optics (AO) offers an opportunity to stabilize an image and maximize the spatial resolution achievable by ground based telescopes by removing the distortions due to the atmosphere. Typically, the deformable mirror in an AO system is integrated into the optical path between the secondary mirror and science instrument; in some cases, the deformable mirror is integrated into the telescope itself as an adaptive secondary mirror.However including the deformable mirror as the primary mirror of the telescope has been left largely unexplored due to the previous cost and complexity of large-format deformable mirror technology. In recent years this technology has improved, leaving deformable primary mirrors as a viable avenue towards higher actuator density and a simplification in testing and deploying adaptive optics systems. We present a case study to explore the benefits and trade-offs of integrating an adaptive optics system using the primary mirror of the telescope in small-to-mid-sized telescopes.",2021-07-27T23:38:57Z,2021-07-29T04:45:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13104v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13104v2,astro-ph.IM

Unsupervised learning-based structural analysis: Search for a   characteristic low-dimensional space by local structures in atomistic   simulations,"Ryo Tamura, Momo Matsuda, Jianbo Lin, Yasunori Futamura, Tetsuya Sakurai, Tsuyoshi Miyazaki","Owing to the advances in computational techniques and the increase in computational power, atomistic simulations of materials can simulate large systems with higher accuracy. Complex phenomena can be observed in such state-of-the-art atomistic simulations. However, it has become increasingly difficult to understand what is actually happening and mechanisms, for example, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We propose an unsupervised machine learning method to analyze the local structure around a target atom. The proposed method, which uses the two-step locality preserving projections (TS-LPP), can find a low-dimensional space wherein the distributions of datapoints for each atom or groups of atoms can be properly captured. We demonstrate that the method is effective for analyzing the MD simulations of crystalline, liquid, and amorphous states and the melt-quench process from the perspective of local structures.

"An Ontology-Based, Fully Probabilistic, Scalable Method for Human   Activity Recognition","Pouya Foudeh, Naomie Salim","Efficiency and scalability are obstacles that have not yet received a viable response from the human activity recognition research community. This paper proposes an activity recognition method. The knowledge model is in the form of ontology, the state-of-the-art in knowledge representation and reasoning. The ontology starts with probabilistic information about subjects' low-level activities and location and then is populated with the assertion axioms learned from data or defined by the user. Unlike methods that choose only the most probable candidate from sensor readings, the proposed method keeps multiple candidates with the known degree of confidence for each one and involves them in decision making. Using this method, the system is more flexible to deal with unreliable readings from sensors, and the final recognition rate is improved. Besides, to resolve the scalability problem, a system is designed and implemented to do reasoning and storing in a relational database management system. Numerical evaluation and conceptual benchmarking prove the proposed system feasibility.",2021-09-07T07:04:42Z,2021-09-07T07:04:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02902v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02902v1,"cs.HC, cs.DB, cs.LO, J.3; H.5.2; G.3"
Modeling of biomolecular machines in non-equilibrium steady states,Thomas Speck,"Numerical computations have become a pillar of all modern quantitative sciences. Any computation involves modeling--even if often this step is not made explicit--and any model has to neglect details while still being physically accurate. Equilibrium statistical mechanics guides both the development of models and numerical methods for dynamics obeying detailed balance. For systems driven away from thermal equilibrium such a universal theoretical framework is missing. For a restricted class of driven systems governed by Markov dynamics and local detailed balance, stochastic thermodynamics has evolved to fill this gap and to provide fundamental constraints and guiding principles. The next step is to advance stochastic thermodynamics from simple model systems to complex systems with ten thousands or even millions degrees of freedom. Biomolecules operating in the presence of chemical gradients and mechanical forces are a prime example for this challenge. In this Perspective, we give an introduction to isothermal stochastic thermodynamics geared towards the systematic multiscale modeling of the conformational dynamics of biomolecular and synthetic machines, and we outline some of the open challenges.",2021-09-08T09:35:49Z,2021-09-08T09:35:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03516v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03516v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.soft, physics.chem-ph"

We consider three-parameter integrable equations that are cubic in partial derivatives of the unknown applying our method of skew factorization of the symmetry condition.

Efficient Black-Box Checking via Model Checking with Strengthened   Specifications,"Junya Shijubo, Masaki Waga, Kohei Suenaga","Black-box checking (BBC)} is a testing method for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) as well as software systems. BBC consists of active automata learning and model checking; a Mealy machine is learned from the system under test (SUT), and the learned Mealy machine is verified against a specification using model checking. When the Mealy machine violates the specification, the model checker returns an input witnessing the specification violation of the Mealy machine. We use it to refine the Mealy machine or conclude that the SUT violates the specification. Otherwise, we conduct equivalence testing to find an input witnessing the difference between the Mealy machine and the SUT. In the BBC for CPSs, equivalence testing tends to be time-consuming due to the time for the system execution. In this paper, we enhance the BBC utilizing model checking with strengthened specifications. By model checking with a strengthened specification, we have more chance to obtain an input witnessing the specification violation than model checking with the original specification. The refinement of the Mealy machine with such an input tends to reduce the number of equivalence testing, which improves the efficiency. We conducted experiments with an automotive benchmark. Our experiment results demonstrate the merit of our method.",2021-09-10T04:01:05Z,2021-09-10T04:01:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04656v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04656v1,cs.LO
Compositional Cyber-Physical Systems Theory,Georgios Bakirtzis,"This dissertation builds a compositional cyber-physical systems theory to develop concrete semantics relating the above diverse views necessary for safety and security assurance. In this sense, composition can take two forms. The first is composing larger models from smaller ones within each individual formalism of requirements, behaviors, and architectures which can be thought of as horizontal composition -- a problem which is largely solved. The second and main contribution of this theory is vertical composition, meaning relating or otherwise providing verified composition across requirement, behavioral, and architecture models and their associated algebras. In this dissertation, we show that one possible solution to vertical composition is to use tools from category theory. Category theory is a natural candidate for making both horizontal and vertical composition formally explicit because it can relate, compare, and/or unify different algebras.",2021-09-10T13:19:11Z,2021-09-10T13:19:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04858v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04858v1,"cs.LO, cs.CR, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.CT"
Specification and Validation of Autonomous Driving Systems: A Multilevel   Semantic Framework,"Marius Bozga, Joseph Sifakis","Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are critical dynamic reconfigurable agent systems whose specification and validation raises extremely challenging problems. The paper presents a multilevel semantic framework for the specification of ADS and discusses associated validation problems. The framework relies on a formal definition of maps modeling the physical environment in which vehicles evolve. Maps are directed metric graphs whose nodes represent positions and edges represent segments of roads. We study basic properties of maps including their geometric consistency. Furthermore, we study position refinement and segment abstraction relations allowing multilevel representation from purely topological to detailed geometric. We progressively define first order logics for modeling families of maps and distributions of vehicles over maps. These are Configuration Logics, which in addition to the usual logical connectives are equipped with a coalescing operator to build configurations of models. We study their semantics and basic properties. We illustrate their use for the specification of traffic rules and scenarios characterizing sequences of scenes. We study various aspects of the validation problem including run-time verification and satisfiability of specifications. Finally, we show links of our framework with practical validation needs for ADS and advocate its adequacy for addressing the many facets of this challenge.",2021-09-14T07:20:56Z,2021-09-14T07:20:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06478v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06478v1,"cs.MA, cs.LO, cs.SE"
"Sequential Modelling with Applications to Music Recommendation,   Fact-Checking, and Speed Reading",Christian Hansen,"Sequential modelling entails making sense of sequential data, which naturally occurs in a wide array of domains. One example is systems that interact with users, log user actions and behaviour, and make recommendations of items of potential interest to users on the basis of their previous interactions. In such cases, the sequential order of user interactions is often indicative of what the user is interested in next. Similarly, for systems that automatically infer the semantics of text, capturing the sequential order of words in a sentence is essential, as even a slight re-ordering could significantly alter its original meaning. This thesis makes methodological contributions and new investigations of sequential modelling for the specific application areas of systems that recommend music tracks to listeners and systems that process text semantics in order to automatically fact-check claims, or ""speed read"" text for efficient further classification.

As a case of study, we focus on the PtSe$_2$, to which pristine form is a trivial semiconductor with an energy gap of $1.2$\,eV. The vacancies states lead to a large topological gap of $180$\,meV within the pristine system gap.

Robust Coordination of Linear Threshold Dynamics on Directed Weighted   Networks,"Laura Arditti, Giacomo Como, Fabio Fagnani, Martina Vanelli","We study asynchronous dynamics in a network of interacting agents updating their binary states according to a time-varying threshold rule. Specifically, agents revise their state asynchronously by comparing the weighted average of the current states of their neighbors in the interaction network with possibly heterogeneous time-varying threshold values. Such thresholds are determined by an exogenous signal representing an external influence field modeling the different agents' biases towards one state with respect to the other one. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for global stability of consensus equilibria, i.e., equilibria where all agents have the same state, robustly with respect to the (constant or time-varying) external field. Our results apply to general weighted directed interaction networks and build on super-modularity properties of certain network coordination games whose best response dynamics coincide with the linear threshold dynamics. In particular, we introduce a novel notion of robust improvement paths for such games and characterize conditions for their existence.",2021-09-26T19:50:01Z,2023-01-31T15:09:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12685v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12685v3,"cs.GT, cs.MA, cs.SI, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.DS, 91A06, 91A10, 91A13, 91A40"

In fact, depending on the network structure, such games may even fail to have pure-strategy Nash equilibria. An example is represented by the well-known matching pennies (discoordination) game.   In this work, we first provide graph-theoretic conditions for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria in mixed network coordination/anti-coordination games of arbitrary size. For the case where such conditions are met, we then study the asymptotic behavior of best-response dynamics and provide sufficient conditions for finite-time convergence to the set of Nash equilibria.

In this study, we use an efficient topological descriptor for complex data, i.e., the Euler characteristics (ECs), as features to characterize the spatiotemporal data collected from dynamical systems and discover the underlying physics. Unsupervised manifold learning and supervised classification results show that EC can be used to efficiently distinguish systems with different while similar governing models.

The global acquisition function is devised to judiciously optimize acquisition functions of two tasks, and its theoretical properties are provided.

Here, a distinctive way to create 1D flat bands is proposed, by either stamping or growing a 2D monolayer on a non-Euclidean topography-patterned surface. Using boron nitride (hBN) as an example, our analysis employing elastic plate theory, density-functional and coarse-grained tight-binding method reveals that hBN's bi-periodic sinusoidal deformation creates pseudo-electric and magnetic fields with unexpected spatial dependence. A combination of these fields leads to anisotropic confinement and 1D flat bands. Moreover, changing the periodic undulations can tune the bandwidth, to drive the system to different strongly correlated regimes such as density waves, Luttinger liquid, and Mott insulator. The 1D nature of these states differs from those obtained in twisted materials and can be exploited to study the exciting physics of 1D quantum systems.",2021-11-18T00:11:04Z,2021-11-18T00:11:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09454v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09454v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.str-el"
Absorption and optical selection rules of tunable excitons in biased   bilayer graphene,"J. C. G. Henriques, Itai Epstein, N. M. R. Peres","Biased bilayer graphene, with its easily tunable band gap, presents itself as the ideal system to explore the excitonic effect in graphene based systems. In this paper we study the excitonic optical response of such a system by combining a tight binding model with the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the latter being solved in a semi-analytical manner, requiring a single numerical quadrature, thus allowing for a transparent calculation. With our approach we start by analytically obtaining the optical selection rules, followed by the computation of the absorption spectrum for the case of a biased bilayer encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, a system which has been the subject of a recent experimental study. An excellent agreement is seen when we compare our theoretical prediction with the experimental data.",2021-11-20T10:29:49Z,2021-11-20T10:29:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10555v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10555v1,"cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, quant-ph"
Probabilistic Model Checking and Autonomy,"Marta Kwiatkowska, Gethin Norman, David Parker","Design and control of autonomous systems that operate in uncertain or adversarial environments can be facilitated by formal modelling and analysis. Probabilistic model checking is a technique to automatically verify, for a given temporal logic specification, that a system model satisfies the specification, as well as to synthesise an optimal strategy for its control. This method has recently been extended to multi-agent systems that exhibit competitive or cooperative behaviour modelled via stochastic games and synthesis of equilibria strategies. In this paper, we provide an overview of probabilistic model checking, focusing on models supported by the PRISM and PRISM-games model checkers. This includes fully observable and partially observable Markov decision processes, as well as turn-based and concurrent stochastic games, together with associated probabilistic temporal logics. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework through illustrative examples from autonomous systems. Finally, we highlight research challenges and suggest directions for future work in this area.",2021-11-20T16:56:28Z,2021-11-20T16:56:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10630v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10630v1,cs.LO
"Materials, physics, and systems for multicaloric cooling","Huilong Hou, Suxin Qian, Ichiro Takeuchi","The calls to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and the demands for higher energy efficiency continue to drive the research worldwide in alternative cooling and refrigeration technologies. The field of caloric cooling has undergone a series of transformations in the past several decades bolstered by the advent of new materials and devices, and these developments have helped fuel the advent of multicalorics in the past decade. Multicaloric materials systems inherently display one or more types of ferroic orders that can give rise to multiple field-induced phase transitions responsible for the caloric effects. Just as multiferroic materials possessing co-existing order parameters have unveiled a plethora of physical phenomena and applications over the years, multicaloric cooling materials have the potential to open up entirely new avenues for extracting heat and spearhead hitherto unknown technological applications. In this Perspective, we survey the emerging field of multicaloric cooling and explore the state-of-the-art caloric materials systems responsive to multiple fields.

Experimental Realization of Non-Abelian Permutations in a Three-State   Non-Hermitian System,"Weiyuan Tang, Kun Ding, Guancong Ma","Eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system exist on complex Riemannian manifolds, with multiple sheets connecting at branch cuts and exceptional points (EPs). These eigenstates can evolve across different sheets, a process that naturally corresponds to state permutation. Here, we report the first experimental realization of non-Abelian permutations in a three-state non- Hermitian system. Our approach relies on the stroboscopic encircling of two different exceptional arcs (EAs), which are smooth trajectories of order-2 EPs appearing from the coalescence of two adjacent states. The non-Abelian characteristics are confirmed by encircling the EAs in opposite sequences. A total of five non-trivial permutations are experimentally realized, which together comprise a non-Abelian group. Our approach provides a reliable way of investigating non-Abelian state permutations and the related exotic winding effects in non- Hermitian systems.",2021-12-02T04:58:23Z,2021-12-02T04:58:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00982v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.00982v1,"quant-ph, physics.class-ph"

Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing.

A Synergy of Institutional Incentives and Networked Structures in   Evolutionary Game Dynamics of Multi-agent Systems,"Ik Soo Lim, Valerio Capraro","Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours (e.g., cooperation and trust) among self-interested agents is an important problem in many disciplines. Network structure and institutional incentives (e.g., punishing antisocial agents) are known to promote prosocial behaviours, when acting in isolation, one mechanism being present at a time. Here we study the interplay between these two mechanisms to see whether they are independent, interfering or synergetic. Using evolutionary game theory, we show that punishing antisocial agents and a regular networked structure not only promote prosocial behaviours among agents playing the trust game, but they also interplay with each other, leading to interference or synergy, depending on the game parameters. Synergy emerges on a wider range of parameters than interference does. In this domain, the combination of incentives and networked structure improves the efficiency of incentives, yielding prosocial behaviours at a lower cost than the incentive does alone. This has a significant implication in the promotion of prosocial behaviours in multi-agent systems.",2021-12-06T15:23:23Z,2022-03-27T19:11:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03112v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03112v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.GT, cs.MA, q-bio.PE"

Universal interference-based construction of Gaussian operations in   hybrid quantum systems,"Mengzhen Zhang, Shoumik Chowdhury, Liang Jiang","Beam-splitter operations are an indispensable resource for processing quantum information encoded in bosonic modes. However, in hybrid quantum systems, it can be challenging to implement reliable beam-splitters between two distinct bosonic modes due to various experimental imperfections. Without beam-splitters, realizing arbitrary Gaussian operations between bosonic modes can become highly non-trivial or even infeasible. In this work, we develop novel interference-based protocols for engineering Gaussian operations in multi-mode hybrid bosonic systems without requiring beam-splitters. Specifically, for a given generic multi-mode Gaussian unitary coupler, we demonstrate a universal scheme for constructing Gaussian operations on a desired subset of bosonic modes, requiring only multiple uses of the given coupler interleaved with single-mode Gaussian unitaries. Our results provide efficient construction of operations crucial to quantum information science and are derived from fundamental physical properties of bosonic systems. The proposed scheme is thus widely applicable to existing platforms and couplers, with the exception of certain edge cases. We introduce a systematic approach to identify and treat these edge cases by utilizing a novel intrinsically invariant structure associated with our interference-based construction.",2021-12-15T15:23:12Z,2021-12-15T15:23:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08208v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08208v1,quant-ph
Verification of Component-based Systems with Recursive Architectures,"Marius Bozga, Radu Iosif, Joseph Sifakis","We study a sound verification method for parametric component-based systems. The method uses a resource logic, a new formal specification language for distributed systems consisting of a finite yet unbounded number of components. The logic allows the description of architecture configurations coordinating instances of a finite number of types of components, by means of inductive definitions similar to the ones used to describe algebraic data types or recursive data structures. For parametric systems specified in this logic, we show that decision problems such as reaching deadlock or violating critical section are undecidable, in general. Despite this negative result, we provide for these decision problems practical semi-algorithms relying on the automatic synthesis of structural invariants allowing the proof of general safety properties. The invariants are defined using the WSkS fragment of the monadic second order logic, known to be decidable by a classical automata-logic connection, thus reducing a verification problem to checking satisfiability of a WSkS formula.",2021-12-15T17:37:02Z,2021-12-15T17:37:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08292v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08292v1,"cs.FL, cs.LO"
Pressure-induced structural transformation of clathrate Ge$_{136}$ via   an ultrafast recrystallization of an amorphous intermediate,"Marián Ryník, Stefano Leoni, Roman Martoňák","We study the pressure-induced structural transformation of Ge$_{136}$ clathrate by ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics. The system under pressure first undergoes amorphization followed by an ultrafast recrystallization to the $\beta$-tin structure on the time scale of 30 ps. The initial pressure-induced amorphization of clathrate is triggered by high pressure while the subsequent fast recrystallization to $\beta$-tin is driven by low temperature. Interestingly, the amorphous intermediate is still diffusive even at room temperature, in spite of very strong undercooling, making the ultrafast recrystallization possible. The system provides an explicit example of structural transformation between two crystalline phases proceeding via non-crystalline intermediate. Upon fast decompression of the amorphous structure with incipient crystalline order the recrystallization is blocked and the system instead proceeds to the tetrahedral LDA amorphous phase.",2021-12-23T12:24:45Z,2021-12-23T12:24:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12486v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12486v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.dis-nn"

Our aim is to identify the main criteria to support application-domain specialists in the selection of the most suitable solvers, according to the application requirements and available resources. To this end, we discuss how the numerical solver is affected by the regular/irregular discretisation of the input domain, the discretisation of the input PDE with piecewise linear or polynomial basis functions, which generally result in a higher/lower sparsity of the coefficient matrix, and the choice of different initial conditions, which are associated with linear systems with multiple right-hand side terms.

Adversarial Decisions on Complex Dynamical Systems using Game Theory,"Andrew C. Cullen, Tansu Alpcan, Alexander C.

Here the competitors try to both positively influence their own returns, while negatively affecting those of their competitors. Modelling these interactions with the so-called Boyd-Kuramoto-Lanchester (BKL) complex dynamical system model yields results that can be applied to business, gaming and security contexts. This paper studies a class of decision problems on the BKL model, where a large set of coupled, switching dynamical systems are analysed using game-theoretic methods.   Due to their size, the computational cost of solving these BKL games becomes the dominant factor in the solution process. To resolve this, we introduce a novel Nash Dominant solver, which is both numerically efficient and exact. The performance of this new solution technique is compared to traditional exact solvers, which traverse the entire game tree, as well as to approximate solvers such as Myopic and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Science Facing Interoperability as a Necessary Condition of Success and   Evil,Remy Demichelis,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as machine learning algorithms, have allowed scientists, marketers and governments to shed light on correlations that remained invisible until now. Beforehand, the dots that we had to connect in order to imagine a new knowledge were either too numerous, too sparse or not even detected. Sometimes, the information was not stored in the same data lake or format and was not able to communicate. But in creating new bridges with AI, many problems appeared such as bias reproduction, unfair inferences or mass surveillance. Our aim is to show that, on one hand, the AI's deep ethical problem lays essentially in these new connections made possible by systems interoperability. In connecting the spheres of our life, these systems undermine the notion of justice particular to each of them, because the new interactions create dominances of social goods from a sphere to another. These systems make therefore spheres permeable to one another and, in doing so, they open to progress as well as to tyranny.

We use the Bayesian optimization framework combined with the density-functional theory approach to determine the stable configuration of atomic species on a hexagonal plane. We show that the optimized structure of 2D Cu-Au exhibits the hexagonal lattice of a hexagonal ring of Cu atoms containing one Au atom, where the number of the Cu atoms is larger than that of the Au atoms in the unit cell, which is difficult to speculate from the atomic distribution of CuAu in the L1$_0$ structure. We also show that 2D Cu-$X$ with $X=$ Be, Zn, and Pd have hexagonal or elongated rings containing different atoms in the unit cell.

The evolution of this baseline scenario consists in the evolution of hospitals, that is, in the possibility of hospitals to make some of their wards excel. The State has a budget, for the evolution of this baseline scenario, which can be used by two financing systems: either by a ""local financing"", i.e., by splitting the budget among the hospitals so that each hospital is managing its own portion of the budget by pursuing the individual benefit, or by a ""central financing"", i.e., by not splitting the budget among the hospitals so that the State is the sole manager of the budget, by pursuing the benefit of the whole community.

In addition, they are inherently sequential, making them unable to leverage the GPU processing power entirely. We propose neural sparse linear solvers, a deep learning framework to learn approximate solvers for sparse symmetric linear systems. Our method relies on representing a sparse symmetric linear system as an undirected weighted graph. Such graph representation is inherently permutation-equivariant and scale-invariant, and it can become the input to a graph neural network trained to regress the solution. We test neural sparse linear solvers on static linear analysis problems from structural engineering. Our method is less accurate than classic algorithms, but it is hardware-independent, fast on GPUs, and applicable to generic sparse symmetric systems without any additional hypothesis. Although many limitations remain, this study shows a general approach to tackle problems involving sparse symmetric matrices using graph neural networks.",2022-03-14T09:17:02Z,2022-03-14T09:17:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06944v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06944v1,"cs.LG, cs.NA, math.NA, G.1.3"
Detecting entanglement in quantum many-body systems via permutation   moments,"Zhenhuan Liu, Yifan Tang, Hao Dai, Pengyu Liu, Shu Chen, Xiongfeng Ma","Multipartite entanglement plays an essential role in both quantum information science and many-body physics. Due to the exponentially large dimension and complex geometric structure of the state space, the detection of entanglement in many-body systems is extremely challenging in reality. Conventional means, like entanglement witness and entropy criterion, either highly depend on the prior knowledge of the studied systems or the detection capability is relatively weak. In this work, we propose a framework for designing multipartite entanglement criteria based on permutation moments, which have an effective implementation with either the generalized control-SWAP quantum circuits or the random unitary techniques. These criteria show strong detection capability in the multi-qubit Ising model with a long-range $XY$ Hamiltonian. The quantities associated with these criteria have clear physical meaning and can be used as entanglement quantifiers, with which we show the entanglement scaling transition in a quantum dynamical phase transition. Furthermore, our framework can also be generalized to detect the much more complicated entanglement structure in quantum many-body systems.",2022-03-16T04:39:54Z,2023-02-09T08:24:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08391v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08391v2,quant-ph

The underlying models are built from data by the dynamical clustering method, called FEM-BV-VAR, and the Lyapunov vectors are approximated based on these models. We test this data-based numerical approach at the hand of three well-understood example systems with increasing dynamical complexity, identifying crucial properties that allow for a successful application of the method: in particular, it turns out that the method requires a clear multiple time scale structure with fast transitions between slow subsystems which can be dynamically characterized by invariant neutral directions of the linear approximation model.",2022-03-19T13:07:24Z,2022-03-19T13:07:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10322v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10322v1,"math.DS, 37N10 (Primary) 86A08, 86A10 (Secondary)"
MetaOnce: A Metaverse Framework Based on Multi-scene Relations and   Entity-relation-event Game,Hongyin Zhu,"Existing metaverse systems lack rich relation types between entities and events. The challenge is that there is no portable framework to introduce rich concepts, relations, events into the metaverse. This paper introduces a new metaverse framework, MetaOnce. This framework proposes to build multi-scene graphs. This framework not only describes rich relations in a single scene but also combines multiple scene graphs into a complete graph for more comprehensive analysis and inference. Prior social network systems mainly describe friend relations. They ignore the effect of entity-relation-event games on the metaverse system and existing rule constraints. We propose a rule controller and impose constraints on the relations that allow the framework to behave in a compliant manner.

Modern ML systems often change user behavior (e.g. personalized recommender systems learn user preferences to deliver recommendations that change online behavior). An externality of behavior change is preference change. This article argues for the establishment of a multidisciplinary endeavor focused on understanding how AI systems change preference: Preference Science. We operationalize preference to incorporate concepts from various disciplines, outlining the importance of meta-preferences and preference-change preferences, and proposing a preliminary framework for how preferences change.

Mobility Equity and Economic Sustainability Using Game Theory,"Ioannis Vasileios Chremos, Andreas Malikopoulos","In this paper, we consider a multi-modal mobility system of travelers each with an individual travel budget, and propose a game-theoretic framework to assign each traveler to a ``mobility service"" (each one representing a different mode of transportation). We are interested in equity and sustainability, thus we maximize the worst-case revenue of the mobility system while ensuring ``mobility equity,"" which we define it in terms of accessibility. In the proposed framework, we ensure that all travelers are truthful and voluntarily participate under informational asymmetry, and the solution respects the individual budget of each traveler. Each traveler may seek to travel using multiple services (e.g., car, bus, train, bike). The services are capacitated and can serve up to a fixed number of travelers at any instant of time. Thus, our problem falls under the category of many-to-one assignment problems, where the goal is to find the conditions that guarantee the stability of assignments. We formulate a linear program of maximizing worst-case revenue under the constraints of mobility equity, and we fully characterize the optimal solution.",2022-03-22T02:27:51Z,2023-02-26T05:49:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11421v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11421v3,"cs.GT, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Forward simulation of large network models is often computationally prohibitive. Yet, most networks have intrinsic community structure. We exploit these communities and propose a fast simulation algorithm for network dynamics. In particular, aggregating the inputs a node receives constitutes the limiting factor in numerically simulating large-scale network dynamics. We develop community integration algorithms (CIAs) significantly reducing function-evaluations. We obtain a substantial reduction from polynomial to linear computational complexity.

4DL: a four-valued Dynamic logic and its proof-theory,Diana Costa,"Transition systems are often used to describe the behaviour of software systems. If viewed as a graph then, at their most basic level, vertices correspond to the states of a program and each edge represents a transition between states via the (atomic) action labelled. In this setting, systems are thought to be consistent so that at each state formulas are evaluated as either True or False.   On the other hand, when a structure of this sort - for example a map where states represent locations, some local properties are known and labelled transitions represent information available about different routes - is built resorting to multiple sources of information, it is common to find inconsistent or incomplete information regarding what holds at each state, both at the level of propositional variables and transitions.   This paper aims at bringing together Belnap's four values, Dynamic Logic and hybrid machinery such as nominals and the satisfaction operator, so that reasoning is still possible in face of contradicting evidence.

Energy-band echoes: Time-reversed light emission from optically driven   quasiparticle wavepackets,"Shohei Imai, Atsushi Ono, Sumio Ishihara","The at-will control of quantum states is a primary goal of quantum science and technology. The celebrated Hahn echo exemplifies such quantum-state control based on a time-reversal process in a few-level system. Here, we propose a different echo phenomenon associated with the energy-band structure in quantum many-body systems. We show that the dynamics of quasiparticle wavepackets can be reversed by a driving electric-field pulse, yielding echoes with the time-reversed waveform of the optical excitation pulse when the quasiparticles recombine. The present echoes are observed not only in band insulators but also in correlated insulators, including a Mott insulator and a spontaneously-broken-symmetry charge-ordered insulator, in one- and higher-dimensional systems, irrespective of the integrability of the models. Analytical expressions reveal the conditions under which the echoes appear, and they also indicate that the frequency of the echo pulses reflects the dispersion relation for quasiparticles such as electron-hole pairs, doublon-holon pairs, and kink-antikink pairs.

The Transferability Limits of Static Benchmarks,"Thomas Weymuth, Markus Reiher","Every practical method to solve the Schr\""odinger equation for interacting many-particle systems introduces approximations. Such methods are therefore plagued by systematic errors. For computational chemistry, it is decisive to quantify the specific error for some system under consideration. Traditionally, the primary resource for such an error assessment have been benchmarking results, usually taken from the literature. However, their transferability to a specific molecular system, and hence, the reliability of the traditional approach always remains uncertain to some degree. In this communication, we elaborate on the shortcomings of this traditional way of static benchmarking by exploiting statistical analyses at the example of one of the largest quantum chemical benchmark sets available. We demonstrate the uncertainty of error estimates in the light of the choice of reference data selected for a benchmark study. To alleviate the issues with static benchmarks, we advocate to rely instead on a rolling and system-focused approach for rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of a quantum chemical result.",2022-04-13T22:35:02Z,2022-06-07T20:24:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06659v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06659v2,"physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.chem-ph"
Puzzles of Existential Generalisation from Type-theoretic Perspective,Jiří Raclavský,"The present paper addresses several puzzles related to the Rule of Existential Generalization, (EG). In solution to these puzzles from the viewpoint of simple type theory, I distinguish (EG) from a modified Rule of Existential Quantifier Introduction which is derivable from (EG). Both these rules are often confused and both are considered as primitive but I show that (EG) itself is derivable from the proper Rule of Existential Quantifier Introduction. Moreover, the latter rule must be primitive in logical systems that treat both total and partial functions, for the universal and the existential quantifiers are not interdefinable in them. An appropriate natural deduction for such a system is deployed. The present logical system is simpler than the system recently proposed and applied by the present author.

Market Integration of Excess Heat,"Linde Frölke, Ida-Marie Palm, Jalal Kazempour","Excess heat will be an important heat source in future carbon-neutral district heating systems. A barrier to excess heat integration is the lack of appropriate scheduling and pricing systems for these producers, which generally have small capacity and limited flexibility. In this work, we formulate and analyze two methods for scheduling and pricing excess heat producers: self-scheduling and market participation. In the former, a price signal is sent to excess heat producers, based on which they determine their optimal schedule. The latter approach allows excess heat producers to participate in a market clearing. In a realistic case study of the Copenhagen district heating system, we investigate market outcomes for the two excess heat integration paradigms under increasing excess heat penetration. An important conclusion is that in systems of high excess heat penetration, simple price signal methods will not suffice, and more sophisticated price signals or coordinated dispatch become a necessity.",2022-04-27T14:04:56Z,2022-04-27T14:04:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12953v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12953v1,cs.CE

In this paper, we take on a new approach by utilizing the large oscillator strength of the above-band gap C exciton in few-layer molybdenum disulphide ($\text{FL-MoS}_2$). We show a k-space Rabi splitting of 293 meV when coupling $\text{FL-MoS}_2$ C excitons to surface plasmon polaritons at room temperature. This value is 11% of the uncoupled exciton energy (2.67 eV or 464 nm), ~2x what is typically seen in the TMDCs, placing the system in the ultrastrong coupling regime.

Body Diagonal Diffusion Couple Method for Estimation of Tracer Diffusion   Coefficients in a Multi-Principal Element Alloy,"Anuj Dash, Aloke Paul","The estimation of (n-1)2 interdiffusion coefficients in an n component system requires (n-1) diffusion paths to intersect or pass closely in the (n-1) dimensional space according to the body diagonal diffusion couple method. These interdiffusion coefficients are related to n(n-1) intrinsic (or n tracer diffusion coefficients), which cannot be estimated easily following the Kirkendall marker experiment in a multicomponent system despite their importance for understanding the atomic mechanism of diffusion and the physico-mechanical properties of materials. In this study, the estimation of tracer diffusion coefficients from only two diffusion profiles following the concept of the body diagonal diffusion couple method in a multicomponent system is demonstrated. Subsequently, one can estimate the intrinsic and interdiffusion coefficients. This reduces the overall effort up to a great extent since it needs only two instead of (n-1) diffusion profiles irrespective of the number of components, with an additional benefit of enabling the estimation of all types of diffusion coefficients. The available tracer diffusion coefficients estimated following the radiotracer method are compared to the data estimated in this study following this method. This method can also be extended to the systems in which the radiotracer method is not feasible.",2022-05-13T10:31:44Z,2022-05-13T10:31:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06550v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06550v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
A Schmidt decomposition approach to quantum thermodynamics,"André Malavazi, Frederico Brito","The development of a self-consistent thermodynamic theory of quantum systems is of fundamental importance for modern physics. Still, despite its essential role in quantum science and technology, there is no unifying formalism for characterizing the thermodynamics within general autonomous quantum systems, and many fundamental open questions remain unanswered. Along these lines, most current efforts and approaches restrict the analysis to particular scenarios of approximative descriptions and semi-classical regimes. Here we propose a novel approach to describe the thermodynamics of arbitrary bipartite autonomous quantum systems based on the well-known Schmidt decomposition. This formalism provides a simple, exact and symmetrical framework for expressing the energetics between interacting systems, including scenarios beyond the standard description regimes, such as strong coupling. We show that this procedure allows a straightforward identification of local effective operators suitable for characterizing the physical local internal energies.

We augment the Maxwell operator with all input source profiles and output projection profiles, followed by a single partial factorization that directly yields the entire multi-input scattering matrix via the Schur complement.

Interdependent Superconducting Networks,"I. Bonamassa, B. Gross, M. Laav, I. Volotsenko, A. Frydman, S.

The theoretical background for these phenomena is rich and interdisciplinary with interdependent networks providing a versatile ""two-interactions"" framework to study their multiscale evolution. Yet, physics experiments aimed at validating this ever-growing volume of predictions have remained elusive, hitherto hindered by the problem of identifying possible physical mechanisms realizing interdependent couplings. Here we develop and study the first experimental realization of an interdependent system as a multilayer network of two disordered superconductors separated by an insulating film. We show that Joule heating effects emerging at sufficiently large driving currents act as dependency links between the superconducting layers, igniting overheating cascades via adaptive back and forth electro-thermal feedbacks.

Open- and Closed-Loop Neural Network Verification using Polynomial   Zonotopes,"Niklas Kochdumper, Christian Schilling, Matthias Althoff, Stanley Bak","We present a novel approach to efficiently compute tight non-convex enclosures of the image through neural networks with ReLU, sigmoid, or hyperbolic tangent activation functions. In particular, we abstract the input-output relation of each neuron by a polynomial approximation, which is evaluated in a set-based manner using polynomial zonotopes. While our approach can also can be beneficial for open-loop neural network verification, our main application is reachability analysis of neural network controlled systems, where polynomial zonotopes are able to capture the non-convexity caused by the neural network as well as the system dynamics.

Existence results for variational-hemivariational inequality systems   with nonlinear couplings,"Yunru Bai, Nicusor Costea, Shengda Zeng","In this paper we investigate a system of coupled inequalities consisting of a variational-hemivariational inequality and a quasi-hemivariational inequality on Banach spaces. The approach is topological, and a wide variety of existence results is established for both bounded and unbounded constraint sets in real reflexive Banach spaces. The main point of interest is that no linearity condition is imposed on the coupling functional, therefore making the system fully nonlinear. Applications to Contact Mechanics are provided in the last section of the paper. More precisely, we consider a contact model with (possibly) multivalued constitutive law whose variational formulation leads to a coupled system of inequalities. The weak solvability of the problem is proved via employing the theoretical results obtained in the previous section. The novelty of our approach comes from the fact that we consider two potential contact zones and the variational formulation allows us to determine simultaneously the displacement field and the Cauchy stress tensor.",2022-07-14T17:25:10Z,2024-04-27T03:53:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07076v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07076v3,"math.AP, math.FA, 35J88, 39B72, 58E50, 70G75, 74M15"

The algorithm we suggest solves the problem in two phases. It starts by constructing the connectivity structure of the system using machine learning methods -- producing thus a graph of interconnected subsystems. Then this graph is enhanced by recovering the Hamiltonian structure of each subsystem as well as the corresponding ports. This second phase relies heavily on results from symplectic and Poisson geometry that we briefly sketch. And the precise solutions can be constructed using methods of computer algebra and symbolic computations. The algorithm permits to extend the port-Hamiltonian formalism to generic ordinary differential equations, hence introducing eventually a new concept of normal forms of ODEs.",2022-07-14T17:36:44Z,2022-07-14T17:36:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07124v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07124v1,cs.CE

Experience with Abrupt Transition to Remote Teaching of Embedded Systems,"Jan Koniarik, Daniel Dlhopolcek, Martin Ukrop","Due to the pandemic of COVID-19, many university courses had to abruptly transform to enable remote teaching. Adjusting courses on embedded systems and micro-controllers was extra challenging since interaction with real hardware is their integral part. We start by comparing our experience with four basic alternatives of teaching embedded systems: 1) interacting with hardware at school, 2) having remote access to hardware, 3) lending hardware to students for at-home work and 4) virtualizing hardware. Afterward, we evaluate in detail our experience of the fast transition from traditional, offline at-school hardware programming course to using remote access to real hardware present in the lab. The somewhat unusual remote hardware access approach turned out to be a fully viable alternative for teaching embedded systems, enabling a relatively low-effort transition. Our setup is based on existing solutions and stable open technologies without the need for custom-developed applications that require high maintenance. We evaluate the experience of both the students and teachers and condense takeaways for future courses.

Engineering Surface Oxygen Vacancies in $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ to Form a   High Mobility and Transparent Quasi Two dimensional Electron System,"Shyam Sundar Yadav, Shelender Kumar, Pankaj Kumar, Ananth Venkatesan","Quasi-two-dimensional electron systems (q-2DES) are formed in various hetero-structures, including oxide interfaces. Oxygen vacancies (OVs) in oxides like $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ are known to produce electronic carriers. A novel way to produce $\mathrm{SrTiO_{3-\delta}}$ on the surface using a low-energy $\mathrm{H_2}$ plasma is shown here. It results in a q-2DES with mobility as high as $\mu \sim 20,000 \; cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$, displaying quantum oscillations in magneto-resistance. We can achieve a sharper or weaker confinement potential by adjusting the process pressure. The system with sharper confinement displays clearer quantum oscillations and Kondo-like temperature dependence of resistance. OVs close to the surface behaving like a correlated Anderson impurity is responsible for the Kondo behaviour. Quantum oscillations are less prominent in the weakly confined system. A cross-over from weak-localization to anti-localization with temperature is seen, but no Kondo behavior. The process also results in a transparent conductor amenable to lithographic patterning. This conductor's standard figure of merit is comparable to poly-crystalline ITO films in the visible regime and extends with similar performance into the $\lambda$ $\sim 1.5$ $\mu m$ telecommunication wavelength.",2022-07-26T14:38:29Z,2022-07-26T14:38:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12933v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.12933v1,"cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.str-el"

In each outer iteration, an inner system has to be solved which in theory has to be done exactly. Whenever the system is getting large, an inner exact solver is, however, no longer efficient or even feasible and iterative methods must be used. We focus this article on a numerical study showing the influence of the accuracy of an inner iterative solution on the accuracy of the solution of the block system. Emphasis is further given on reducing the computational cost, which is defined as the total number of inner iterations.

Differentiable Inference of Temporal Logic Formulas,"Nicole Fronda, Houssam Abbas","We demonstrate the first Recurrent Neural Network architecture for learning Signal Temporal Logic formulas, and present the first systematic comparison of formula inference methods. Legacy systems embed much expert knowledge which is not explicitly formalized. There is great interest in learning formal specifications that characterize the ideal behavior of such systems -- that is, formulas in temporal logic that are satisfied by the system's output signals. Such specifications can be used to better understand the system's behavior and improve design of its next iteration. Previous inference methods either assumed certain formula templates, or did a heuristic enumeration of all possible templates. This work proposes a neural network architecture that infers the formula structure via gradient descent, eliminating the need for imposing any specific templates. It combines learning of formula structure and parameters in one optimization. Through systematic comparison, we demonstrate that this method achieves similar or better mis-classification rates (MCR) than enumerative and lattice methods. We also observe that different formulas can achieve similar MCR, empirically demonstrating the under-determinism of the problem of temporal logic inference.",2022-08-10T16:52:23Z,2022-08-10T16:52:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05440v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05440v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.LO, cs.SE"

Disordered Hyperuniform Quasi-1D Materials,"Duyu Chen, Yu Liu, Yu Zheng, Houlong Zhuang, Mohan Chen, Yang Jiao","Carbon nanotubes are quasi-one-dimensional systems that possess superior transport, mechanical, optical, and chemical properties. In this work, we generalize the notion of disorder hyperuniformity, a recently discovered exotic state of matter with hidden long-range order, to quasi-one-dimensional materials. As a proof of concept, we then apply the generalized framework to quantify the density fluctuations in amorphous carbon nanotubes containing randomly distributed Stone-Wales defects. We demonstrate that all of these amorphous nanotubes are hyperuniform, i.e., the infinite-wavelength density fluctuations of these systems are completely suppressed, regardless of the diameter, rolling axis, number of rolling sheets, and defect fraction of the nanotubes. We find that these amorphous nanotubes are energetically more stable than nanotubes with periodically distributed Stone-Wales defects. Moreover, certain semiconducting defect-free carbon nanotubes become metallic as sufficiently large amounts of defects are randomly introduced. This structural study of amorphous nanotubes strengthens our fundamental understanding of these systems, and suggests possible exotic physical properties, as endowed by their disordered hyperuniformity. Our findings also shed light on the effect of dimensionality reduction on the hyperuniformity property of materials.",2022-08-21T20:46:09Z,2022-08-21T20:46:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09958v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09958v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Software Performability Analysis Using Fast Parametric Model Checking,"Xinwei Fang, Radu Calinescu, Simos Gerasimou, Faisal Alhwikem","We present an efficient parametric model checking (PMC) technique for the analysis of software performability, i.e., of the performance and dependability properties of software systems. The new PMC technique works by automatically decomposing a parametric discrete-time Markov chain (pDTMC) model of the software system under verification into fragments that can be analysed independently, yielding results that are then combined to establish the required software performability properties. Our fast parametric model checking (fPMC) technique enables the formal analysis of software systems modelled by pDTMCs that are too complex to be handled by existing PMC methods. Furthermore, for many pDTMCs that state-of-the-art parametric model checkers can analyse, fPMC produces solutions (i.e., algebraic formulae) that are simpler and much faster to evaluate. We show experimentally that adding fPMC to the existing repertoire of PMC methods improves the efficiency of parametric model checking significantly, and extends its applicability to software systems with more complex behaviour than currently possible.",2022-08-25T09:32:07Z,2022-10-23T19:50:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12723v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12723v2,cs.LO
Topological classification for intersection singularities of exceptional   surfaces in pseudo-Hermitian systems,"Hongwei Jia, Ruo-Yang Zhang, Jing Hu, Yixin Xiao, Yifei Zhu, C. T. Chan","Exceptional points play a pivotal role in the topology of non-Hermitian systems, and significant advances have been made in classifying exceptional points and exploring the associated phenomena. Exceptional surfaces, which are hypersurfaces of exceptional degeneracies in parameter space, can support hypersurface singularities, such as cusps, intersections and swallowtail catastrophes. Here we topologically classify the intersection singularity of exceptional surfaces for a generic pseudo-Hermitian system with parity-time symmetry. By constructing the quotient space under equivalence relations of eigenstates, we reveal that the topology of such gapless structures can be described by a non-Abelian free group on three generators. Importantly, the classification predicts a new kind of non-Hermitian gapless topological phase and can systematically explain how the exceptional surfaces and their intersections evolve under perturbations with symmetries preserved. Our work opens a new pathway for designing systems with robust topological phases, and provides inspiration for applications such as sensing and lasing which can utilize the special properties inherent in exceptional surfaces and intersections.",2022-09-07T11:04:45Z,2022-09-07T11:04:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03068v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03068v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.optics"

In spite of these advances, the reliability of modern MLPs in reproducing the subtle details of the multi-dimensional potential-energy surface is still difficult to assess for such systems. On the other hand, moderately sized systems enabling the application of tools for thorough and systematic quality-control are nowadays rarely investigated. In this work we use benchmark-quality harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies as a sensitive probe for the validation of high-dimensional neural network potentials.

The paradox of infinitesimal granularity: Chaos and the reversibility of   time in Newton's theory of gravity,"Simon Portegies Zwart, Tjarda Boekholt","The fundamental laws of physics are time-symmetric, but our macroscopic experience contradicts this. The time reversibility paradox is partly a consequence of the unpredictability of Newton's equations of motion. We measure the dependence of the fraction of irreversible, gravitational N-body systems on numerical precision and find that it scales as a power law. The stochastic wave packet reduction postulate then introduces fundamental uncertainties in the Cartesian phase space coordinates that propagate through classical three-body dynamics to macroscopic scales within the triple's lifetime. The spontaneous collapse of the wave function then drives the global chaotic behavior of the Universe through the superposition of triple systems (and probably multi-body systems). The paradox of infinitesimal granularity then arises from the superposition principle, which states that any multi-body system is composed of an ensemble of three-body problems.",2022-09-06T20:48:25Z,2022-09-06T20:48:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03347v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03347v1,"nlin.CD, astro-ph.IM, gr-qc, physics.space-ph"

However, an implicit assumption in this guarantee is that each agent is aware of the decisions of all other agents. In this work, we first describe how this guarantee degrades as agents are only aware of a subset of the decisions of other agents.

A Simplified Model for the Battery Ageing Potential Under Highly Rippled   Load for Battery Management and Active Degradation Control,"Tomas Kacetl, Jan Kacetl, Nima Tashakor, Stefan Goetz","Whereas in typical standardized tests batteries are almost exclusively loaded with constant current or relatively slowly changing cycles, real applications involve rapid load ripple, which do not contribute to the net energy. The trend to reduced filter capacitors and even dynamically reconfigurable batteries further increases the ripple. The influence of rippled load on lithium batteries is therefore receiving increased attention. According to recent studies, accelerated ageing strongly depends on the frequency of the ripple. We use electrochemical models to derive a highly simplified regression model that catches the asymptotic behavior and allows parameter identification and calibration to specific cells. The model allows quantitative monitoring of the additional ageing due to ripple current in battery management systems. Furthermore it enables active control of the ageing potential by influencing the frequency content in modern battery systems, such as reconfigurable batteries.",2022-09-19T08:33:08Z,2022-09-19T08:33:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08836v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08836v1,"eess.SY, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.SY, physics.chem-ph"

Yielding and Strain Stiffening in Entangled Assemblies of Frictional   Granular Chains,"M. Reza Shaebani, Mehdi Habibi","Packings of macroscopic granular chains capture some of the essential aspects of molecular polymer systems and have been suggested as a paradigm to understand the physics on a molecular scale. However, here we demonstrate that the interparticle friction $\mu$ in granular chain packings, which has no counterpart in polymer systems, leads to a nontrivial yielding and rheological response. Based on discrete element simulations we study the nonlinear rheology of random packings of granular chains under large amplitude oscillatory shear. We find that the maximum stress and the penetration depth of the shear deformation into the material bulk are nonmonotonic functions of friction with extrema at intermediate values of $\mu$. We also show that the regularly repeated gaps between the adjacent grains, which are special to commercial granular chains, broaden the shear zone and enhance the entanglements in the system by promoting the interlocking events between chains. These topological constraints can significantly increase the degree of strain stiffening.

As a step in the Delphi process to define issues with trust and barriers to the adoption of autonomous systems, our study first collected and ranked the top concerns from a panel of international experts from the fields of engineering, computer science, medicine, aerospace, and defence, with experience working with artificial intelligence. This document presents a summary of the literature definitions for nomenclature derived from expert feedback.",2022-10-14T16:54:20Z,2022-10-14T16:54:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09086v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09086v1,"cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Polar meron-antimeron networks in strained and twisted bilayers,"Daniel Bennett, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager, Eric Bousquet, Philippe Ghosez","Out-of-plane polar domain structures have recently been discovered in strained and twisted bilayers of inversion symmetry broken systems such as hexagonal boron nitride. Here we show that this symmetry breaking also gives rise to an in-plane component of polarization, and the form of the total polarization is determined purely from symmetry considerations. The in-plane component of the polarization makes the polar domains in strained and twisted bilayers topologically non-trivial, forming a network of merons and antimerons (half-skyrmions and half-antiskyrmions). For twisted systems, the merons are of Bloch type whereas for strained systems they are of N\'eel type. We propose that the polar domains in strained or twisted bilayers may serve as a platform for exploring topological physics in layered materials and discuss how control over topological phases and phase transitions may be achieved in such systems.",2022-10-19T18:00:00Z,2023-03-15T19:36:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10786v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10786v2,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall"
Stochastic transitions: Paths over higher energy barriers can dominate   in the early stages,"S. P. Fitzgerald, A. Bailey Hass, G. Díaz Leines, A. J. Archer","The time evolution of many physical, chemical, and biological systems can be modelled by stochastic transitions between the minima of the potential energy surface describing the system of interest. We show that in cases where there are two (or more) possible pathways that the system can take, the time available for the transition to occur is crucially important. The well-known results of reaction rate theory for determining the rates of the transitions apply in the long-time limit. However, at short times, the system can instead choose to pass over higher energy barriers with much higher probability, as long as the distance to travel in phase space is shorter. We construct two simple models to illustrate this general phenomenon. We also present an extension of the gMAM algorithm of Vanden-Eijnden and Heymann [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 128}, 061103 (2008)] to determine the most likely path at both short and long times.",2022-10-20T13:58:19Z,2022-10-20T13:58:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11280v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11280v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.soft, physics.chem-ph"
Characterizing information loss in a chaotic double pendulum with the   Information Bottleneck,"Kieran A. Murphy, Dani S. Bassett","A hallmark of chaotic dynamics is the loss of information with time. Although information loss is often expressed through a connection to Lyapunov exponents -- valid in the limit of high information about the system state -- this picture misses the rich spectrum of information decay across different levels of granularity. Here we show how machine learning presents new opportunities for the study of information loss in chaotic dynamics, with a double pendulum serving as a model system. We use the Information Bottleneck as a training objective for a neural network to extract information from the state of the system that is optimally predictive of the future state after a prescribed time horizon. We then decompose the optimally predictive information by distributing a bottleneck to each state variable, recovering the relative importance of the variables in determining future evolution. The framework we develop is broadly applicable to chaotic systems and pragmatic to apply, leveraging data and machine learning to monitor the limits of predictability and map out the loss of information.",2022-10-25T17:59:38Z,2022-10-25T17:59:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14220v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14220v1,"cs.LG, cs.IT, math.IT, nlin.CD"
Chemically Aware Unitary Coupled Cluster with ab initio Calculations on   System Model H1: A Refrigerant Chemicals Application,"I. T. Khan, M. Tudorovskaya, J. J. M. Kirsopp, D. Muñoz Ramo, P. W. Warrier, D. K. Papanastasiou, R. Singh","Circuit depth reduction is of critical importance for quantum chemistry simulations on current and near term quantum computers. This issue is tackled by introducing a chemically aware strategy for the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz. The objective is to use the chemical description of a system to aid in the synthesis of a quantum circuit. We combine this approach with two flavours of Symmetry Verification for the reduction of experimental noise. These method enable the use of System Model H1 for a 6-qubit QSE (Quantum Subspace Expansion). We present (i) calculations to obtain CH4 optical spectra; (ii) an atmospheric gas reaction simulation involving $[$CH$^{\cdot}_3$--H--OH$^{\cdot}]^{\ddagger}$. Using our chemically aware UCC state-preparation strategy in tandem with state of the art symmetry verification methods, we improve device yield for CH4 at 6-qubits. This is demonstrated by a 90% improvement in two-qubit gate count and reduction in relative error to 0.2% for electronic energy calculated on System Model H1.",2022-10-26T16:33:17Z,2022-10-26T16:33:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14834v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14834v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Nested Sequents for Intuitionistic Grammar Logics via Structural   Refinement,Tim S. Lyon,"Intuitionistic grammar logics fuse constructive and multi-modal reasoning while permitting the use of converse modalities, serving as a generalization of standard intuitionistic modal logics. In this paper, we provide definitions of these logics as well as establish a suitable proof theory thereof. In particular, we show how to apply the structural refinement methodology to extract cut-free nested sequent calculi for intuitionistic grammar logics from their semantics. This method proceeds by first transforming the semantics of these logics into sound and complete labeled sequent systems, which we prove have favorable proof-theoretic properties such as syntactic cut-elimination. We then transform these labeled systems into nested sequent systems via the introduction of propagation rules and the elimination of structural rules. Our derived proof systems are then put to use, whereby we prove the conservativity of intuitionistic grammar logics over their modal counterparts, establish the general undecidability of these logics, and recognize a decidable subclass, referred to as ""simple"" intuitionistic grammar logics.",2022-10-31T08:38:23Z,2022-10-31T08:38:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17139v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17139v1,"cs.LO, cs.DM, math.LO"
First Demonstration Experiment for Energy Trading System EDISON-X Using   the XRP Ledger,"Yuichi Ikeda, Yu Ohki, Zelda Marquardt, Yu Kimura, Sena Omura, Emi Yoshikawa","We develop an energy trading system, EDISON-X, that uses blockchain technology to manage the buying and selling of electricity usage rights, i.e., tokens. UPX and SPX tokens purchase electricity from the utility company's distribution lines and the photovoltaic panels. On July 1, 17 students in our school dormitory participated in an experiment to confirm the operation of the EDISON-X system. Based on the results of this experiment, we discuss the energy trading system using blockchain technology for the effective usage of renewable energy. We develop topology and network science methodologies to understand the characteristics of energy trading. We test the hypothesis that market transactions become less active when ``cavities'' appear using persistent homology. The preliminary result implies that the hypothesis could be adopted. We, however, need more data samples.",2022-12-05T05:47:21Z,2022-12-05T05:47:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02044v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02044v1,cs.CR
Transient non-Hermitian skin effect,"Zhongming Gu, He Gao, Haoran Xue, Jensen Li, Zhongqing Su, Jie Zhu","The discovery of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has opened an exciting direction for unveiling unusual physics and phenomena in non-Hermitian system. Despite notable theoretical breakthroughs, actual observation of NHSE's whole evolvement, however, relies mainly on gain medium to provide amplified mode. It typically impedes the development of simple, robust system. Here, we show that a passive system is fully capable of supporting the observation of the complete evolution picture of NHSE, without the need of any gain medium. With a simple lattice model and acoustic ring resonators, we use complex-frequency excitation to create virtual gain effect, and experimentally demonstrate that exact NHSE can persist in a totally passive system during a quasi-stationary stage. This results in the transient NHSE: passive construction of NHSE in a short time window. Despite the general energy decay, the localization character of skin modes can still be clearly witnessed and successfully exploited. Our findings unveil the importance of excitation in realizing NHSE and paves the way towards studying the peculiar features of non-Hermitian physics with diverse passive platforms.",2022-12-12T09:23:34Z,2022-12-12T09:23:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05787v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05787v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci
