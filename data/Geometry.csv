We show that Lambda-algebraic geometry is in a precise sense an algebraic geometry over a deeper base than Z and that it has many properties predicted for algebraic geometry over the mythical field with one element. Moreover, it does this is a way that is both formally robust and closely related to active areas in arithmetic algebraic geometry.",2009-06-17T11:27:20Z,2009-06-17T11:27:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3146v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.3146v1,"math.NT, math.AG"

Problems in algebra inspired by universal algebraic geometry,Boris Plotkin,"Let $\Theta$ be a variety of algebras. In every $\Theta$ and every algebra $H$ from $\Theta$ one can consider algebraic geometry in $\Theta$ over $H$. We consider also a special categorical invariant $K_\Theta (H)$ of this geometry. The classical algebraic geometry deals with the variety $\Theta=Com-P$ of all associative and commutative algebras over the ground field of constants $P$. An algebra $H$ in this setting is an extension of the ground field $P$. Geometry in groups is related to varieties $\Grp$ and $\Grp-G$, where $G$ is a group of constants. The case $\Grp -F$ where $F$ is a free group, is related to Tarski's problems devoted to logic of a free group. he described general insight on algebraic geometry in different varieties of algebras inspires some new problems in algebra and algebraic geometry. The problems of such kind determine, to a great extent, the content of universal algebraic geometry.

Automorphic equivalence of one-sorted algebras,A. Tsurkov,"One of the central questions of universal algebraic geometry is: when two algebras have the same algebraic geometry? There are various interpretations of the sentence ""Two algebras have the same algebraic geometry"". One of these is automorphic equivalence of algebras, which is discussed in this paper, and the other interpretation is geometric equivalence of algebras. In this paper we consider very wide and natural class of algebras: one sorted algebras from IBN variety. The variety is called an IBM variety if two free algebras W(X), W(Y) of this variety are isomorphic if and only if the powers of sets X and Y coincide. In the researching of the automorphic equivalence of algebras we must study the group of automorphisms of the category of the all finitely generated free algebras of our variety and the group of its automorphisms. By [PZ, Theorem 2], if we deal with an IBN variety of one-sorted algebras, then every strongly stable (see Definition 3.1) automorphism of our category defines the other algebraic structure on every algebra H of our variety, such that this algebra with the new algebraic structure automorphically equivalent to the algebra H (Theorem 4.1), i.e., has the same algebraic geometry. From this we conclude the necessary and sufficient conditions for two algebras to be automorphically equivalent. We formulate these conditions by using the notion of geometric equivalence of algebras. It means that we reduce automorphic equivalence of algebras to the simpler notion of geometric equivalence. This paper is a continuation of the research which was started in [PZ].",2005-09-02T08:03:55Z,2006-02-18T21:20:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509032v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0509032v3,"math.GM, 08A99"

Equiresidual algebraic geometry I: The affine theory,Jean Barbet,"In this first work dedicated to the generalisation of classic algebraic geometry to non algebraically closed fields and axiomatisable classes of fields, we develop the foundations for equiresidual algebraic geometry (EQAG), i.e. algebraic geometry over any commutative field $k$, algebraically closed or not. This is possible thanks to the existence in non algebraically closed fields of many normic forms, i.e. homogeneous polynomials with no non-trivial zero rational in $k$, and relies on an equiresidual generalisation of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and the Jacobson radical in finitely presented $k$-algebras. Usual algebraic constructions are naturally worked out using a new type of $k$-algebras which correspond to localisations of $k$-algebras by means of polynomials over $k$ with no inner zero. The theory leads to a fruitful characterisation of the sections of sheaves of regular functions over affine algebraic sets, providing a dualisation of the (equiresidual) affine algebraic varieties over $k$ by an equiresidual analogue of reduced algebras of finite type. The true generalisation of reduced algebras are defined using the normic forms and encompass all rings of rational functions over affine subvarieties. These ""special"" algebras are interpreted as giving rise to a ""special"" radical, an equiresidual version of the classic radical of an ideal, of which we give a clean algebraic characterisation. Special extensions are the ""right"" field extensions of the ground field in EQAG and provide a connexion with model-theoretic algebraic geometry, as exemplified with real closed fields and p-adically closed fields. The special radical is well-behaved with respect to localisation, and this leads to an equiresidual analogue of the prime spectrum, which connects affine EQAG with scheme theory.",2019-12-01T07:51:15Z,2022-07-09T08:02:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00347v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00347v3,"math.AG, 14A10, 14A99"
Langlands Reciprocity for Algebraic Surfaces,"Victor Ginzburg, Mikhail Kapranov, Eric Vasserot","This note is an attempt to extend ""Geometric Langlands Conjecture"" from algebraic curves to algebraic surfaces. We introduce certain Hecke-type operators on vector bundles on an algebraic surface. The crucial observation is that the algebra generated by the Hecke operators turns out to be a homomorphic image of the {\it quantum toroidal algebra}. The latter is a quantization, in the spirit of Drinfeld-Jimbo, of the universal enveloping algebra of the universal central extension of a ""double-loop"" Lie algebra. This yields, in particular, a new geometric construction of affine quantum groups of types A, D E in terms of Hecke operators for an elliptic surface.",1995-02-20T19:09:13Z,1995-02-20T19:09:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9502013v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-alg/9502013v1,"q-alg, alg-geom, math.AG, math.QA"
Examples of geodesic ghor algebras on hyperbolic surfaces,"Karin Baur, Charlie Beil","Cancellative dimer algebras on a torus have many nice algebraic and homological properties. However, these nice properties disappear for dimer algebras on higher genus surfaces. We consider a new class of quiver algebras on surfaces, called 'geodesic ghor algebras', that reduce to cancellative dimer algebras on a torus, yet continue to have nice properties on higher genus surfaces. These algebras exhibit a rich interplay between their central geometry and the topology of the surface. We show that (nontrivial) geodesic ghor algebras do in fact exist, and give explicit descriptions of their central geometry. This article serves a companion to the article 'A generalization of cancellative dimer algebras to hyperbolic surfaces', where the main statement is proven.",2021-01-25T11:37:57Z,2021-01-25T11:37:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10843v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10843v1,math.RA

They can be characterized as a class of Lie-admissible algebras whose negative left multiplication operators make representations of the commutator Lie algebras. We observe that there is a clear analogy between anti-pre-Lie algebras and pre-Lie algebras by comparing them in terms of several aspects. Furthermore, it is unexpected that a subclass of anti-pre-Lie algebras, namely admissible Novikov algebras, correspond to Novikov algebras in terms of $q$-algebras. Consequently, there is a construction of admissible Novikov algebras from commutative associative algebras with derivations or more generally, admissible pairs. The correspondence extends to the level of Poisson type structures, leading to the introduction of the notions of anti-pre-Lie Poisson algebras and admissible Novikov-Poisson algebras, whereas the latter correspond to Novikov-Poisson algebras.",2022-07-13T13:55:26Z,2022-07-13T13:55:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06200v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06200v1,"math.QA, math-ph, math.MP, math.RT, math.SG, 17A36, 17A40, 17B10, 17B40, 17B60, 17B63, 17D25"

We first investigate several technical algebraic properties of a hyperring. In the second part, we begin by giving another interpretation of a tropical variety as an algebraic set over the hyperfield which canonically arises from a totally ordered semifield. Then we define a notion of an integral hyperring scheme $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ and prove that $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)\simeq R$ for any integral affine hyperring scheme $X=Spec R$.",2015-12-15T16:13:06Z,2015-12-15T16:13:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04837v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04837v1,"math.AG, math.AC, 14A99 (primary), 14T99(secondary)"
Some Quantitative Results in Real Algebraic Geometry,Salvador Barone,"Real algebraic geometry is the study of semi-algebraic sets, subsets of $\R^k$ defined by Boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and inequalities. The focus of this thesis is to study quantitative results in real algebraic geometry, primarily upper bounds on the topological complexity of semi-algebraic sets as measured, for example, by their Betti numbers. Another quantitative measure of topological complexity which we study is the number of homotopy types of semi-algebraic sets of bounded description complexity. The description complexity of a semi-algebraic set depends on the context, but it is simply some measure of the complexity of the polynomials in the formula defining the semi-algebraic set (e.g., the degree and number of variables of a polynomial, the so called dense format). We also provide a description of the Hausdorff limit of a one-parameter family of semi-algebraic sets, up to homotopy type which the author hopes will find further use in the future. Finally, in the last chapter of this thesis, we prove a decomposition theorem similar to the well-known cylindrical decomposition for semi-algebraic sets but which has the advantage of requiring significantly less cells in the decomposition. The setting of this last result is not in semi-algebraic geometry, but in the more general setting of o-minimal structures.",2013-07-31T15:23:38Z,2013-07-31T15:23:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8353v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.8353v1,"math.AG, 14P10, 14P25"
Growth of the dimension of the homogeneous components of Color Lie   Superalgebras,Shadi Shaqaqha,"The growth of the dimension of the homogeneous components of algebra is an essential topic in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. In this context, the homogeneous components of an algebra are the pieces of the algebra that have the same degree. The study of the growth of the dimension of these components can shed light on the structure of the algebra and its behavior as the degree of the components increases. This concept is particularly important in the study of polynomial rings, which are a fundamental object in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. Understanding the growth of the dimension of their homogeneous components can provide insight into the geometry of the corresponding algebraic varieties. This topic is also particularly important in the study of projective varieties, where the homogeneous components correspond to the spaces of sections of line bundles of increasing degree. Understanding the growth of these spaces is crucial for understanding the geometry of the variety.

Geometric Methods in Representation Theory of Hecke Algebras and Quantum   Groups,Victor Ginzburg,"These lectures given in Montreal in Summer 1997 are mainly based on, and form a condensed survey of, the book by N. Chriss and V. Ginzburg: `Representation Theory and Complex Geometry', Birkhauser 1997.   Various algebras arising naturally in Representation Theory such as the group algebra of a Weyl group, the universal enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra, a Quantum group or the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of bi-invariant functions (under convolution) on a p-adic group, are considered.   We give a uniform geometric construction of these algebras in terms of homology of an appropriate ""Steinberg-type"" variety Z (or its modification, such as K-theory or elliptic cohomology of Z, or an equivariant version thereof). We then explain how to obtain a complete classification of finite dimensional irreducible representations of the algebras in question, using our geometric construction and perverse sheaves methods.   Similar techniques can be applied to other algebras, e.g. the Double-affine Hecke algebras, Elliptic algebras, quantum toroidal algebras.",1998-01-31T23:58:38Z,1998-03-05T00:12:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9802004v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9802004v3,"math.AG, hep-th, math.DG, math.QA, math.RT"

This article explains this parallelism, so that the appearance of invariants of new type in complexified gauge theory (see Donaldson--Thomas [D-T] and Thomas [T]) can be accompanied by analogous invariants in the theory of special Lagrangian cycles, for which the development is at present much more modest than in gauge theory.

Algebraic Noncommutative Geometry,Jonathan Gratus,"A noncommutative algebra $A$, called an algebraic noncommutative geometry, is defined, with a parameter $\epsilon$ in the centre. When $\epsilon$ is set to zero, the commutative algebra $A^0$ of algebraic functions on an algebraic manifold $M$ is obtained. This $A^0$ is a subalgebra of $C(M)$, which is dense if $M$ is compact. The generators of $A$ define an immersion of $M$ into $R^n$, and $M$ inherits a Poisson structure as the limit of the commutator. Thus $A$ is a quantisation of a Poisson manifold. If an ordering convention is prescribed for $A$ then a star product on $M$ is obtained. Homomorphism and isomorphisms between noncommutative geometries are defined, and the map from $A$ to the Heisenberg algebra is used both to give an analogue of a coordinate chart, and to give $A$ a quantum group structure. Examples of algebraic noncommutative geometries are given, which include $R^n$, $T^\star S^2$, $T^2$, $S^2$ and surfaces of rotation. A definition of a metric on $M$ which can be extended to noncommutative geometry is given and this is used in an application of noncommutative geometry to the numerical analysis of surfaces.",1999-05-29T19:36:16Z,1999-05-29T19:36:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9905187v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9905187v1,"math.QA, hep-th, 81S05; 14A22; 81Q20; 58Z05"

Furthermore we formulate the Thom spaces for vector bundles on (motivic) stacks, and we obtain the algebraic cobordism for (motivic) stacks.

If our original algebra is the path algebra of a quiver whose underlying graph is a tree, this construction recovers the zigzag algebras of Huerfano and Khovanov. We study examples of higher zigzag algebras coming from Iyama's iterative construction of type A higher representation finite algebras. We give presentations of these algebras by quivers and relations, and describe relations between spherical twists acting on their derived categories. We then make a connection to the McKay correspondence in higher dimensions: if G is a finite abelian subgroup of the special linear group acting on affine space, then the skew group algebra which controls the category of G-equivariant sheaves is Koszul dual to a higher zigzag algebra. Using this, we show that our relations between spherical twists appear naturally in examples from algebraic geometry.",2017-11-02T16:08:23Z,2019-05-17T16:33:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00794v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00794v3,"math.RT, math.AG, math.RA"

On algebraic volume density property,"Shulim Kaliman, Frank Kutzschebauch",A smooth affine algebraic variety $X$ equipped with an algebraic volume form $\omega$ has the algebraic volume density property (AVDP) if the Lie algebra generated by completely integrable algebraic vector fields of $\omega$-divergence zero coincides with the space of all algebraic vector fields of $\omega$-divergence zero. We develop an effective criterion of verifying whether a given $X$ has AVDP. As an application of this method we establish AVDP for any homogeneous space $X=G/R$ that admits a $G$-invariant algebraic volume form where $G$ is a linear algebraic group and $R$ is a closed reductive subgroup of $G$.,2012-01-23T17:03:13Z,2014-02-06T21:45:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4769v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4769v2,"math.AG, 14R20, 32M05"

On certain noncommutative geometries via categories of sheaves of   (graded) PI-algebras,"Lucio Centrone, Maurício Corrêa","In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries, which include, for example, the following algebras: superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic 0 and a topological space $X$; we construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the sheaf structure belongs to the $G$-graded variety $\text{G-var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$, which classify all geometric spaces that belong to $\text{G-var}(A)$.

Non-Archimedean analytic geometry as relative algebraic geometry,"Oren Ben-Bassat, Kobi Kremnizer","We show that Berkovich analytic geometry can be viewed as relative algebraic geometry in the sense of To\""{e}n--Vaqui\'{e}--Vezzosi over the category of non-Archimedean Banach spaces. For any closed symmetric monoidal quasi-abelian category we can define a topology on certain subcategories of the of the category of affine schemes with respect to this category. By examining this topology for the category of Banach spaces we recover the G-topology or the topology of admissible subsets on affinoids which is used in analytic geometry. This gives a functor of points approach to non-Archimedean analytic geometry and in this way we also get definitions of (higher) non-Archimedean analytic stacks. We demonstrate that the category of Berkovich analytic spaces embeds fully faithfully into the category of varieties in our version of relative algebraic geometry. We also include a treatment of quasi-coherent sheaf theory in analytic geometry. Along the way, we use heavily the homological algebra in quasi-abelian categories developed by Schneiders.",2013-12-02T06:33:32Z,2015-08-06T01:32:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0338v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0338v3,"math.AG, math.CT, math.FA, math.NT, math.RT, 14A20, 13J07, 14G22, 14E25, 46M99, 18D10, 19D23, 14F20"
On the D-module and formal-variable approaches to vertex algebras,"Yi-Zhi Huang, James Lepowsky","In a program to formulate and develop two-dimensional conformal field theory in the framework of algebraic geometry, Beilinson and Drinfeld have recently given a notion of ``chiral algebra'' in terms of D-modules on algebraic curves. This definition consists of a ``skew-symmetry'' relation and a ``Jacobi identity'' relation in a categorical setting. In this paper, we show directly that these chiral algebras are essentially the same as vertex algebras without vacuum vector (and without grading), by establishing an equivalence between the skew-symmetry and Jacobi identity relations of Beilinson-Drinfeld and the (similarly-named, but different) skew-symmetry and Jacobi identity relations in the formal-variable approach to vertex operator algebra theory as formulated by Borcherds, Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman and Frenkel-Huang-Lepowsky.",1996-03-23T23:01:26Z,1996-03-23T23:01:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9603020v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-alg/9603020v1,"q-alg, alg-geom, hep-th, math.AG, math.QA"

We can thus obtain, over good semi-fields, the analog of classical correpondences between polynomials, and varieties of zeros...

Three-Dimensional Projective Geometry with Geometric Algebra,"Hongbo Li, Lei Huang, Changpeng Shao, Lei Dong","The line geometric model of 3-D projective geometry has the nice property that the Lie algebra sl(4) of 3-D projective transformations is isomorphic to the bivector algebra of CL(3,3), and line geometry is closely related to the classical screw theory for 3-D rigid-body motions. The canonical homomorphism from SL(4) to Spin(3,3) is not satisfying because it is not surjective, and the projective transformations of negative determinant do induce orthogonal transformations in the Pl\""ucker coordinate space of lines.   This paper presents our contributions in developing a rigorous and convenient algebraic framework for the study of 3-D projective geometry with Clifford algebra. To overcome the unsatisfying defects of the Pl\""ucker correspondence, we propose a group Pin^{sp}(3,3) with Pin(3,3) as its normal subgroup, to quadruple-cover the group of 3-D projective transformations and polarities.

We give a necessary and sufficient condition for this, in terms of tropical geometry of $A$. In the course of this we introduce the notion of a Khovanskii basis for $(A, \mathfrak{v})$ which provides a framework for far extending Gr\""obner theory on polynomial algebras to general finitely generated algebras. In particular, this makes a direct connection between the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies and tropical geometry, and toric degenerations arising in both contexts. We also construct an associated compactification of $Spec(A)$.

We study the coarse median universe from the perspective of intervals, with a particular focus on cardinality as a proxy for distance. In particular we prove that the metric on a quasi-geodesic coarse median space of bounded geometry can be constructed up to quasi-isometry using only the coarse median operator.

We explore a duality between geometry on the function algebra vs geometry on the group algebra, i.e. on the dual Hopf algebra, illustrated by the noncommutative Riemannian geometry of the group algebra of $S_3$. We show how quiver geometries arise naturally in the context of quantum principal bundles.

The 1-forms correspond to graphs and the exterior derivative of a subset amounts to the arrows that cross between the set and its complement. The line graph $0-1-2$ has a non-flat but Ricci flat quantum Riemannian geometry. The previously known four quantum geometries on the triangle graph, of which one is curved, are revisited in terms of left-invariant differentials, as are the quantum geometries on the dual Hopf algebra, the group algebra of $\Bbb Z_3$. For the square, we find a moduli of four quantum Riemannian geometries, all flat, while for an $n$-gon with $n>4$ we find a unique one, again flat. We also propose an extension of de Morgan duality to general algebras and differentials over $\Bbb F_2$.",2019-11-21T23:52:02Z,2020-12-10T16:14:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12127v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12127v3,math.QA

Multi derivation Maurer-Cartan algebras and sh-Lie-Rinehart algebras,Johannes Huebschmann,"We extend the classical characterization of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra g in terms of its Maurer-Cartan algebra-the familiar differential graded algebra of alternating forms on g with values in the ground field, endowed with the standard Lie algebra cohomology operator-to sh Lie-Rinehart algebras. To this end, we first develop a characterization of sh Lie-Rinehart algebras in terms of differential graded cocommutative coalgebras and Lie algebra twisting cochains that extends the nowadays standard characterization of an ordinary sh Lie algebra (equivalently: Linfty algebra) in terms of its associated generalized Cartan-Chevalley-Eilenberg coalgebra. Our approach avoids any higher brackets but reproduces these brackets in a conceptual manner. The new technical tool we develop is a notion of filtered multi derivation chain algebra, somewhat more general than the standard notion of a multicomplex endowed with a compatible algebra structure. The crucial observation, just as for ordinary Lie-Rinehart algebras, is this: For a general sh Lie-Rinehart algebra,the generalized Cartan-Chevalley-Eilenberg operator on the corresponding graded algebra involves two operators, one coming from the sh Lie algebra structure and the other from the generalized action on the corresponding algebra; the sum of the operators is defined on the algebra while the operators are individually defined only on a larger ambient algebra.

Lyakhovsky,The elements of the wide class of quantum universal enveloping algebras are prooved to be Hopf algebras $H$ with spectrum $Q(H)$ in the category of groups. Such quantum algebras are quantum groups for simply connected solvable Lie groups $P(H)$. This provides utilities for a new algorithm of constructing quantum algebras especially useful for nonsemisimple ones. The quantization procedure can be carried out over an arbitrary field. The properties of the algorithm are demonstrated on examples.,1994-05-06T12:35:43Z,1994-05-06T12:35:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9405044v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9405044v1,"hep-th, alg-geom, math.AG"

Blow-ups and normal bundles in connective and nonconnective derived   geometries,"Oren Ben-Bassat, Jeroen Hekking","This work presents a generalization of derived blow-ups and of the derived deformation to the normal bundle from derived algebraic geometry to any geometric context. The latter is our proposed globalization of a derived algebraic context, itself a generalization of the theory of simplicial commutative rings.   One key difference between a geometric context and ordinary derived algebraic geometry is that the coordinate ring of an affine object in the former is not necessarily connective. When constructing generalized blow-ups, this not only turns out to be remarkably convenient, but also leads to a wider existence result. Indeed, we show that the derived Rees algebra and the derived blow-up exist for any affine morphism of stacks in a given geometric context. However, in general the derived Rees algebra will no longer be connective, hence in general the derived blow-up will not live in the connective part of the theory. Unsurprisingly, this can be solved by restricting the input to closed immersions. The proof of the latter statement uses a derived deformation to the normal bundle in any given geometric context, which is also of independent interest.   Besides the geometric context which extends algebraic geometry, the second main example of a geometric context will be an extension of analytic geometry. The latter is a recent construction, and includes many different flavors of analytic geometry, such as complex analytic geometry, non-archimedean rigid analytic geometry and analytic geometry over the integers. The present work thus provides derived blow-ups and a derived deformation to the normal bundle in all of these, which is expected to have many applications.",2023-03-21T16:21:36Z,2023-03-26T16:11:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11990v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11990v2,"math.AG, 14A30, 14F08, 14C17, 14D23, 14N35"

We discuss all entities that can be represented naturally in this homogeneous Clifford algebra model. Projective automorphisms of Klein's quadric induce projective transformations of $P^3(\mathbb{R})$ and vice versa.

Fibred product of commutative algebras: generators and relations,Nadezda V.

The field of coefficients is not supposed to be algebraically closed and can be of any characteristic. Formation of fibred product of commutative associative algebras is an algebraic counterpart of gluing algebraic schemes by means of some equivalence relation in algebraic geometry. If initial algebras are finite-dimensional vector spaces the dimension of their product obeys Grassmann-like formula. Finite-dimensional case means geometrically the strict version of adding two collections of points containing some common part.   The method involves description of algebras by generators and relations on input and returns similar description of the product algebra. It is ""ready-to-eat"" even for computer realization. The product algebra is well-defined: taking another descriptions of the same algebras leads to isomorphic product algebra. Also it is proven that the product algebra enjoys universal property, i.e. it is indeed fibred product. The input data is a triple of algebras and a pair of homomorphisms $A_1\stackrel{f_1}{\to}A_0 \stackrel{f_2}{\leftarrow}A_2$. Algebras and homomorphisms can be described in any fashion.

Decorated algebraic matroids can be computed via symbolic computation using Groebner bases, or through linear algebra in the space of differentials (with decorations calculated using numerical algebraic geometry). Both algorithms are developed here. Failure of the second algorithm occurs on a subvariety called the non-matroidal or NM- locus. Decorated algebraic matroids have widespread relevance anywhere that coordinates have combinatorial significance.

n-Representation infinite algebras,"Martin Herschend, Osamu Iyama, Steffen Oppermann","From the viewpoint of higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory, we introduce a new class of finite dimensional algebras of global dimension n, which we call n-representation infinite. They are a certain analog of representation infinite hereditary algebras, and we study three important classes of modules: n-preprojective, n-preinjective and n-regular modules. We observe that their homological behaviour is quite interesting. For instance they provide first examples of algebras having infinite Ext^1-orthogonal families of modules. Moreover we give general constructions of n-representation infinite algebras.   Applying Minamoto's theory on Fano algebras in non-commutative algebraic geometry, we describe the category of n-regular modules in terms of the corresponding preprojective algebra. Then we introduce n-representation tame algebras, and show that the category of n-regular modules decomposes into the categories of finite dimensional modules over localizations of the preprojective algebra. This generalizes the classical description of regular modules over tame hereditary algebras.

Relative Poisson bialgebras and Frobenius Jacobi algebras,"Guilai Liu, Chengming Bai","Jacobi algebras, as the algebraic counterparts of Jacobi manifolds, are exactly the unital relative Poisson algebras. The direct approach of constructing Frobenius Jacobi algebras in terms of Manin triples is not available due to the existence of the units, and hence alternatively we replace it by studying Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras. Such structures are equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely, relative Poisson bialgebras. The study of coboundary cases leads to the introduction of the relative Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (RPYBE). Antisymmetric solutions of the RPYBE give coboundary relative Poisson bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal O$-operators of relative Poisson algebras and relative pre-Poisson algebras are introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPYBE. A direct application is that relative Poisson bialgebras can be used to construct Frobenius Jacobi algebras, and in particular, there is a construction of Frobenius Jacobi algebras from relative pre-Poisson algebras.",2023-03-04T04:31:45Z,2023-03-04T04:31:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02316v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02316v1,"math.QA, math-ph, math.MP, math.RA, math.RT, math.SG, 17B63, 17A36, 18M70, 17D25, 17A40, 37J39, 53D17"

In this paper we explore the algebra of quantum idempotents and show that they generate Iterant algebra (defined in the paper), Lie algebra, Grassmann algebra and Clifford algebra which is very interesting because these later algebras were introduced for the geometry of spaces and hence are called geometric algebras. Thus the projection operator representation gives a new meaning to these geometric algebras in that they are also underlying algebras of quantum processes and also they bring geometry closer to the quantum theory. It should be noted that projection operators not only make lattices of quantum logic but they also span projective geometry. We will give iterant representations of framed braid group algebras, parafermion algebras and the $su(3)$ algebra of quarks. These representations are very striking because iterant algebra encodes the spatial and temporal aspects of recursive processes. In that regard our representation of these algebras for physics opens up entirely new perspectives of looking at fermions,spins and parafermions(anyons).",2017-05-17T05:46:11Z,2017-11-02T15:54:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06600v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06600v2,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP, 57M 25"
Noncommutative Koszul filtrations,Dmitri Piontkovski,"We study associative graded algebras which have a ``complete flag'' of cyclic modules with linear free resolutions, i.e., algebras over which there is a cyclic Koszul module with every admissible number of relations (from zero up to the number of generators of the algebra). Commutative algebras with the same property has been studied in several papers by A. Conca and others. Here we present a non-commutative version.   We introduce the concept of Koszul filtration in non-commutative algebras and study its connections with Koszul algebras and algebras with quadratic Groebner bases. Also, here are considered several examples, such as ``Groebner flags'', generic algebras, and algebras with one relation. A generalization of the concept Koszul filtration (generalized Koszul, or rate, filtration) leads to algebras with finite Backelin's rate and to coherent algebras. One of our main results is that every algebra with Koszul filtration (or with finite rate filtration) has rational Hilbert series.",2003-01-21T15:49:39Z,2003-01-21T15:49:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0301233v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0301233v1,"math.RA, math.AC, math.AG, 16S37(Primary), 16W50, 16E65, 16S38"
Topics in hidden symmetries. IV,Denis V. Juriev,"This note being devoted to some aspects of the inverse problem of representation theory explicates the links between researches on the Sklyanin algebras and the author's (based on the noncommutative geometry) approach to the setting free of hidden symmetries in terms of ""the quantization of constants"". Namely, the Racah-Wigner algebra for the Sklyanin algebra is constructed. It may be considered as a result of the quantization of constants in the Racah-Wigner algebra for the Lie algebra $sl(2,C)$. The Racah-Wigner algebra for the Sklyanin algebra is an example of the noncommutative weighted shift operator algebras (NWSO-algebras), which generalize the mho-algebras introduced by the author earlier. If the Sklyanin algebra is interpreted as an algebra of anomalous spins then the Racah-Wigner algebra for it may be regarded as an enlargement of the Sklyanin algebra by operators of the anomalous spin-spin interaction (of tensor type).",1996-11-18T23:25:42Z,1996-11-18T23:25:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9611019v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-alg/9611019v1,"q-alg, funct-an, hep-th, math.FA, math.QA"

At 8 loops and beyond, algebraic geometry informs us that polylogs are insufficient for the evaluation of terms in the beta-function of $\phi^4$ theory.

Cone structures and parabolic geometries,"Jun-Muk Hwang, Katharina Neusser","A cone structure on a complex manifold $M$ is a closed submanifold $\mathcal C \subset \mathbb P TM$ of the projectivized tangent bundle which is submersive over $M$. A conic connection on $\mathcal C$ specifies a distinguished family of curves on $M$ in the directions specified by $\mathcal C$. There are two common sources of cone structures and conic connections, one in differential geometry and another in algebraic geometry. In differential geometry, we have cone structures induced by the geometric structures underlying holomorphic parabolic geometries, a classical example of which is the null cone bundle of a holomorphic conformal structure. In algebraic geometry, we have the cone structures consisting of varieties of minimal rational tangents (VMRT) given by minimal rational curves on uniruled projective manifolds. The local invariants of the cone structures in parabolic geometries are given by the curvature of the parabolic geometries, the nature of which depend on the type of the parabolic geometry, i.e., the type of the fibers of $\mathcal C \to M$. For the VMRT-structures, more intrinsic invariants of the conic connections which do not depend on the type of the fiber play important roles. We study the relation between these two different aspects for the cone structures induced by parabolic geometries associated with a long simple root of a complex simple Lie algebra. As an application, we obtain a local differential-geometric version of the global algebraic-geometric recognition theorem due to Mok and Hong--Hwang. In our local version, the role of rational curves is completely replaced by appropriate torsion conditions on the conic connection.",2020-10-28T13:17:59Z,2020-10-28T13:17:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14958v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14958v1,"math.DG, math.AG, 53B99 (Primary) 53C56, 14M15 (Secondary)"
Encoding of algebraic geometry codes with quasi-linear complexity   $O(N\log N)$,"Songsong Li, Shu Liu, Liming Ma, Yunqi Wan, Chaoping Xing","Fast encoding and decoding of codes have been always an important topic in code theory as well as complexity theory. Although encoding is easier than decoding in general, designing an encoding algorithm of codes of length $N$ with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\log N)$ is not an easy task. Despite the fact that algebraic geometry codes were discovered in the early of 1980s, encoding algorithms of algebraic geometry codes with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\log N)$ have not been found except for the simplest algebraic geometry codes--Reed-Solomon codes. The best-known encoding algorithm of algebraic geometry codes based on a class of plane curves has quasi-linear complexity at least $O(N\log^2 N)$. In this paper, we design an encoding algorithm of algebraic geometry codes with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\log N)$. Our algorithm works well for a large class of algebraic geometry codes based on both plane and non-plane curves.   The main idea of this paper is to generalize the divide-and-conquer method from the fast Fourier Transform over finite fields to algebraic curves. Suppose we consider encoding of algebraic geometry codes based on an algebraic curve ${\mathcal X}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We first consider a tower of Galois coverings ${\mathcal X}={\mathcal X}_0\rightarrow{\mathcal X}_1\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow{\mathcal X}_r$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, i.e., their function field tower $\mathbb{F}_q({\mathcal X}_0)\supsetneq\mathbb{F}_q({\mathcal X}_{1})\supsetneq\cdots \supsetneq\mathbb{F}_q({\mathcal X}_r)$ satisfies that each of extension $\mathbb{F}_q({\mathcal X}_{i-1})/\mathbb{F}_q({\mathcal X}_i)$ is a Galois extension and the extension degree $[\mathbb{F}_q({\mathcal X}_{i-1}):\mathbb{F}_q({\mathcal X}_i)]$ {is a constant}. Then encoding of an algebraic geometry code based on ${\mathcal X}$ is reduced to the encoding of an algebraic geometry code based on ${\mathcal X}_r$.",2024-07-05T16:18:30Z,2024-07-05T16:18:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04618v1,cs.CC

Enumerative tropical algebraic geometry in R2,Grigory Mikhalkin,The paper establishes a formula for enumeration of curves of arbitrary genus in toric surfaces. It turns out that such curves can be counted by means of certain lattice paths in the Newton polygon. The formula was announced earlier in http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0209253.   The result is established with the help of the so-called tropical algebraic geometry.

"On Absolute Algebraic Geometry, the affine case","Alain Connes, Caterina Consani","We develop algebraic geometry for general Segal's Gamma-rings and show that this new theory unifies two approaches we had considered earlier on (for a geometry under Spec Z). The starting observation is that the category obtained by gluing together the category of commutative rings and that of pointed commutative monoids, that we used in our previous work to define F1-schemes, is naturally a full subcategory of the category of Segal's Gamma-rings. In this paper we develop the affine case of this general algebraic geometry: one distinctive feature is that the spectrum Spec(A) of a Gamma-ring is in general a Grothendieck site rather than a point set endowed with a topology. Two striking features of this new geometry are that it is the natural domain for cyclic homology and for homological algebra, and that new operations, which do not make sense in ordinary algebraic geometry, are here available. For instance, in this new context, the quotient of a ring by a multiplicative subgroup is still a Gamma-ring to which our general theory applies. Thus the adele class space gives rise naturally to a Gamma-ring. Finally, we show that our theory is not a special case of the T\""oen-Vaqui\' e general theory of algebraic geometry under Spec Z.",2019-09-21T08:32:10Z,2019-09-21T08:32:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09796v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09796v1,"math.AG, math.AT, math.CT, 14G40, 14A20, 14G40, 18G55, 18G30, 16Y60, 19D55, 11R56"

The entire framework is a natural extension of linear equations of equilibrium, but to describe the space of solutions will require (nonlinear) polynomials. In our examples, minors of a structured matrix determine the singular locus of the algebraic variety of interest. At these singular points, more interesting phenomena can occur, which we investigate in the context of the tensegrity 3-prism, our running example. Tools from algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, semidefinite programming, and numerical algebraic geometry will be used. Although at first it is all linear algebra, the examples will motivate the study of systems of polynomial equations.

A geometric characterization of the finitary special linear and unitary   Lie algebras,"Hans Cuypers, Marc Oostendorp","An extremal element $x$ in a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is an element for which the space $[x, [x, \mathfrak{g}]]$ is contained in the linear span of $x$. Long root elements in classical Lie algebras are examples of extremal elements. Lie algebras generated by extremal elements lead to geometries with as points the $1$-spaces generate by extremal elements an as lines the $2$-spaces whose non-zero elements are pairwise commuting extremal elements.   In this paper we show that the finitary special linear Lie algebras can be characterized by their extremal geometry.

Arquile varieties -- varieties consisting of power series in a single   variable,"Herwig Hauser, Sebastian Woblistin","Arquile varieties are zerosets of polynomial, algebraic, analytic, or formal equations f(t,y_1,...,y_m) = 0 with solutions y(t) = (y_1(t),...,y_m(t)) in affine m-space over an algebraic, convergent or formal power series ring k<t>, k{t}, or k[[t]]. As such they generalize the concept of the arc space of an algebraic variety.   In the article, the geometry of arquile varieties is studied in detail. Among other things, it is shown that, after a suitable stratification, their singularities, once defined appropriately, are confined to a finite dimensional part. The main technique to do this is to combine, as is standard in the theory of arc spaces, tools from algebraic geometry and commutative algebra with the additional knowledge that the points of arquile varieties are not just abstract objects (as they are in classical algebraic and analytic geometry) but concrete power series having their proper series expansion.",2021-10-15T17:45:10Z,2021-10-15T17:45:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08236v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08236v1,"math.AG, math.AC, math.CV"

Numerical Nonlinear Algebra,"Daniel J. Bates, Paul Breiding, Tianran Chen, Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Anton Leykin, Frank Sottile","Numerical nonlinear algebra is a computational paradigm that uses numerical analysis to study polynomial equations. Its origins were methods to solve systems of polynomial equations based on the classical theorem of B\'ezout. This was decisively linked to modern developments in algebraic geometry by the polyhedral homotopy algorithm of Huber and Sturmfels, which exploits the combinatorial structure of the equations and led to efficient software for solving polynomial equations.   Subsequent growth of numerical nonlinear algebra continues to be informed by algebraic geometry and its applications. These include new approaches to solving, algorithms for studying positive-dimensional varieties, certification, and a range of applications both within mathematics and from other disciplines. With new implementations, numerical nonlinear algebra is now a fundamental computational tool for algebraic geometry and its applications. We survey some of these innovations and some recent applications.",2023-02-16T21:14:43Z,2024-03-07T01:33:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08585v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08585v2,"math.AG, cs.NA, math.NA, 14Q65, 65H14"

Comparison of stratified-algebraic and topological K-theory,"Wojciech Kucharz, Krzysztof Kurdyka","Stratified-algebraic vector bundles on real algebraic varieties have many desirable features of algebraic vector bundles but are more flexible. We give a characterization of the compact real algebraic varieties having the following property: There exists a positive integer r such that for any topological vector bundle E on X, the direct sum of r copies of E is isomorphic to a stratified-algebraic vector bundle. In particular, each compact real algebraic variety of dimension at most 8 has this property.

Nonnoetherian homotopy dimer algebras and noncommutative crepant   resolutions,Charlie Beil,"Noetherian dimer algebras form a prominent class of examples of noncommutative crepant resolutions (NCCRs). However, dimer algebras which are noetherian are quite rare, and we consider the question: how close are nonnoetherian homotopy dimer algebras to being NCCRs? To address this question, we introduce a generalization of NCCRs to nonnoetherian tiled matrix rings. We show that if a noetherian dimer algebra is obtained from a nonnoetherian homotopy dimer algebra $A$ by contracting each arrow whose head has indegree 1, then $A$ is a noncommutative desingularization of its nonnoetherian center. Furthermore, if any two arrows whose tails have indegree 1 are coprime, then $A$ is a nonnoetherian NCCR.",2016-09-26T18:39:25Z,2017-10-05T19:00:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08112v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08112v2,"math.RA, math.AG, math.RT"

Homological Algebra for Superalgebras of Differentiable Functions,"David Carchedi, Dmitry Roytenberg","This is the second in a series of papers laying the foundations for a differential graded approach to derived differential geometry (and other geometries in characteristic zero). In this paper, we extend the classical notion of a dg-algebra to define, in particular, the notion of a differential graded algebra in the world of C-infinity rings. The opposite of the category of differential graded C-infinity algebras contains the category of differential graded manifolds as a full subcategory. More generally, this notion of differential graded algebra makes sense for algebras over any (super) Fermat theory, and hence one also arrives at the definition of a differential graded algebra appropriate for the study of derived real and complex analytic manifolds and other variants. We go on to show that, for any super Fermat theory S which admits integration, a concept we define and show is satisfied by all important examples, the category of differential graded S-algebras supports a Quillen model structure naturally extending the classical one on differential graded algebras, both in the bounded and unbounded case (as well as differential algebras with no grading).

"The Projective Parabolic Geometry of Riemannian, Kähler and   Quaternion-Kähler Metrics",George E. Frost,"We present a uniform framework generalising and extending the classical theories of projective differential geometry, c-projective geometry, and almost quaternionic geometry. Such geometries, which we call \emph{projective parabolic geometries}, are abelian parabolic geometries whose flat model is an R-space $G\cdot\mathfrak{p}$ in the infinitesimal isotropy representation $\mathbb{W}$ of a larger self-dual symmetric R-space $H\cdot\mathfrak{q}$. We also give a classification of projective parabolic geometries with $H\cdot\mathfrak{q}$ irreducible which, in addition to the aforementioned classical geometries, includes a geometry modelled on the Cayley plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$ and conformal geometries of various signatures.   The larger R-space $H\cdot\mathfrak{q}$ severely restricts the Lie-algebraic structure of a projective parabolic geometry. In particular, by exploiting a Jordan algebra structure on $\mathbb{W}$, we obtain a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-grading on the Lie algebra of $H$ in which we have tight control over Lie brackets between various summands. This allows us to generalise known results from the classical theories. For example, which riemannian metrics are compatible with the underlying geometry is controlled by the first BGG operator associated to $\mathbb{W}$.   In the final chapter, we describe projective parabolic geometries admitting a $2$-dimensional family of compatible metrics. This is the usual setting for the classical projective structures; we find that many results which hold in these settings carry over with little to no changes in the general case.",2016-05-14T12:02:30Z,2016-05-14T12:02:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04406v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.04406v1,math.DG

"A note on exponential varieties, statistical manifolds and Frobenius   structures",Noemie C. Combe,"New relations between algebraic geometry, information theory and Topological Field Theory are developed. One considers models of databases subject to noise i.e. probability distributions on finite sets, related to exponential families. We prove explicitly that these manifolds have the structure of a pre-Frobenius manifold, being a pre-structure appearing in the process of axiomatisation of Topological Field Theory. On one hand, this allows us to develop relations to algebraic geometry, by proving explicitly that a statistical pre-Frobenius manifold forms an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e. $\mathbb{Q}$-toric variety). On the other hand, this allows further developments of recent results concerning the hidden symmetries of those objects. Using classical web theory, it has been shown that those symmetries have the structure of Commutative Moufang Loops. Our result allows to develop more algebraically this statement, in a two-fold way. First, from an algebraic point of view it follows that statistical pre-Frobenius manifolds are equipped with algebraizable webs. Secondly, from the differential geometry point of view, it follows that these webs are hexagonal and isoclinic. This statement is important since it directly impacts the geometric properties of the {\it statistical data}, which are tightly related to the webs. Hence, this allows deeper connections to the branch of algebraic statistics, which is concerned with the development of techniques in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, to address problems in statistics and its applications. Examples are provided and discussed.",2021-10-06T09:26:14Z,2022-07-07T08:42:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02607v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02607v3,"math.AG, math.DG"
Geometry of webs of algebraic curves,Jun-Muk Hwang,"A family of algebraic curves covering a projective variety $X$ is called a web of curves on $X$ if it has only finitely many members through a general point of $X$. A web of curves on $X$ induces a web-structure, in the sense of local differential geometry, in a neighborhood of a general point of $X$. We study how the local differential geometry of the web-structure affects the global algebraic geometry of $X$. Under two geometric assumptions on the web-structure, the pairwise non-integrability condition and the bracket-generating condition, we prove that the local differential geometry determines the global algebraic geometry of $X$, up to generically finite algebraic correspondences. The two geometric assumptions are satisfied, for example, when $X \subset {\bf P}^N$ is a Fano submanifold of Picard number 1, and the family of lines covering $X$ becomes a web. In this special case, we have a stronger result that the local differential geometry of the web-structure determines $X$ up to biregular equivalences. As an application, we show that if $X, X' \subset {\bf P}^N, \dim X' \geq 3,$ are two such Fano manifolds of Picard number 1, then any surjective morphism $f: X \to X'$ is an isomorphism.",2016-05-17T05:06:35Z,2016-05-17T05:06:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05018v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05018v1,"math.AG, math.CV, math.DG, 14M22, 32D15, 14J45, 32H04, 53A60"

Geometric combinatorial algebras: cyclohedron and simplex,"Stefan Forcey, Derriell Springfield","In this paper we report on results of our investigation into the algebraic structure supported by the combinatorial geometry of the cyclohedron. Our new graded algebra structures lie between two well known Hopf algebras: the Malvenuto-Reutenauer algebra of permutations and the Loday-Ronco algebra of binary trees. Connecting algebra maps arise from a new generalization of the Tonks projection from the permutohedron to the associahedron, which we discover via the viewpoint of the graph associahedra of Carr and Devadoss. At the same time that viewpoint allows exciting geometrical insights into the multiplicative structure of the algebras involved. Extending the Tonks projection also reveals a new graded algebra structure on the simplices. Finally this latter is extended to a new graded Hopf algebra (one-sided) with basis all the faces of the simplices.",2009-08-20T23:01:29Z,2010-12-06T18:51:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3111v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.3111v2,"math.CO, math.QA, math.RA, 05E05, 06A11, 16W30"
Exterior differential calculus in generalized Lie algebras(algebroids)   category with applications to interior and exterior algebraic(differential)   systems,"C. M. Arcus, E. Peyghan","A new category of Lie algebras, called generalized Lie algebras, is presented such that classical Lie algebras and Lie-Rinehart algebras are objects of this new category. A new philosophy over generalized Lie algebroids theory is presented using the notion of generalized Lie algebra and examples of objects of the category of generalized Lie algebroids are presented. An exterior differential calculus on generalized Lie algebras is pre- sented and a theorem of Maurer-Cartan type is obtained. Supposing that any submodule(vector subbundle) of a generalized Lie algebra(algebroid) is an interior algebraic(differential) system (IAS(IDS)) for that generalized Lie algebra/algebroid, then the involutivity of the IAS(IDS) in a result of Frobenius type is characterized.

Skew polynomial algebras with coefficients in Koszul Artin-Schelter   regular algebras,"Jiwei He, Fred Van Oystaeyen, Yinhuo Zhang",Let $A$ be a Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebra with Nakayama automorphism $\xi$. We show that the Yoneda Ext-algebra of the skew polynomial algebra $A[z;\xi]$ is a trivial extension of a Frobenius algebra. Then we prove that $A[z;\xi]$ is Calabi-Yau; and hence each Koszul Artin Schelter regular algebra is a subalgebra of a Koszul Calabi-Yau algebra. A superpotential $\hat{w}$ is also constructed so that the Calabi-Yau algebra $A[z;\xi]$ is isomorphic to the derivation quotient of $\hat{w}$.

"The Hopf algebra of skew shapes, torsion sheaves on A^n/F_1, and ideals   in Hall algebras of monoid representations",Matt Szczesny,"We study ideals in Hall algebras of monoid representations on pointed sets corresponding to certain conditions on the representations. These conditions include the property that the monoid act via partial permutations, that the representation possess a compatible grading, and conditions on the support of the module. Quotients by these ideals lead to combinatorial Hopf algebras which can be interpreted as Hall algebras of certain sub-categories of modules. In the case of the free commutative monoid on n generators, we obtain a co-commutative Hopf algebra structure on $n$-dimensional skew shapes, whose underlying associative product amounts to a ""stacking"" operation on the skew shapes. The primitive elements of this Hopf algebra correspond to connected skew shapes, and form a graded Lie algebra by anti-symmetrizing the associative product. We interpret this Hopf algebra as the Hall algebra of a certain category of coherent torsion sheaves on $\mathbb{A}_{/ \mathbb{F}_1}^n$ supported at the origin, where $\mathbb{F}_1$ denotes the field of one element. This Hopf algebra may be viewed as an $n$-dimensional generalization of the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions, which corresponds to the case $n=1$.",2017-06-13T04:44:05Z,2017-06-13T04:44:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03900v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03900v1,"math.RT, math.AG, math.CO, math.QA"
Perfect algebraic stacks,Tianwei Liang,"We develop a theory of perfect algebraic stacks that extend our theory of perfect algebraic spaces in arXiv:2303.07672, arXiv:2303.08502 to the setting of algebraic stacks. We prove several desired properties of perfect algebraic stacks. This extends some previous results of perfect schemes and perfect algebraic spaces, including the recent one developed by Bertapelle et al. in arXiv:1611.02060. Moreover, our theory extends the previous one developed by Xinwen Zhu in arXiv:1707.05700.   Our method to define perfect algebraic stacks differs from all previous approaches, as we utilize representability of algebraic spaces. There is a natural notion of algebraic Frobenius morphisms of algebraic stacks. The algebraic Frobenius morphism provides one with an explicit description of the perfection of an algebraic stack. This gives rise to the perfection functor on algebraic stacks, which enables us to pass between the usual and the perfect world.",2023-03-16T09:22:40Z,2023-03-16T09:22:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09951v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09951v1,math.AG
Conformal blocks on smoothings via mode transition algebras,"Chiara Damiolini, Angela Gibney, Daniel Krashen","Here we define a series of associative algebras attached to a vertex operator algebra $V$, called mode transition algebras, showing they reflect both algebraic properties of $V$ and geometric constructions on moduli of curves. One can define sheaves of coinvariants on pointed coordinatized curves from $V$-modules. We show that if the mode transition algebras admit multiplicative identities with certain properties, these sheaves deform as wanted on families of curves with nodes (so $V$ satisfies smoothing). Consequently, coherent sheaves of coinvariants defined by vertex operator algebras that satisfy smoothing form vector bundles. We also show that mode transition algebras give information about higher level Zhu algebras and generalized Verma modules. As an application, we completely describe higher level Zhu algebras of the Heisenberg vertex algebra for all levels, proving a conjecture of Addabbo--Barron.",2023-07-07T18:00:00Z,2024-04-16T19:38:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03767v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03767v4,"math.QA, math.AG, 14H10, 17B69 (primary), 81R10, 81T40, 14D21 (secondary)"
The isomorphism problem for some universal operator algebras,"Kenneth R. Davidson, Christopher Ramsey, Orr Shalit","This paper addresses the isomorphism problem for the universal (nonself-adjoint) operator algebras generated by a row contraction subject to homogeneous polynomial relations. We find that two such algebras are isometrically isomorphic if and only if the defining polynomial relations are the same up to a unitary change of variables, and that this happens if and only if the associated subproduct systems are isomorphic. The proof makes use of the complex analytic structure of the character space, together with some recent results on subproduct systems. Restricting attention to commutative operator algebras defined by radical relations yields strong resemblances with classical algebraic geometry. These commutative operator algebras turn out to be algebras of analytic functions on algebraic varieties. We prove a projective Nullstellensatz connecting closed ideals and their zero sets. Under some technical assumptions, we find that two such algebras are isomorphic as algebras if and only if they are similar, and we obtain a clear geometrical picture of when this happens. This result is obtained with tools from algebraic geometry, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and some new complex-geometric rigidity results of independent interest. The C*-envelopes of these algebras are also determined. The Banach-algebraic and the algebraic classification results are shown to hold for the weak-operator closures of these algebras as well.",2010-10-04T23:33:01Z,2011-05-24T15:45:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0729v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.0729v3,"math.OA, math.FA, 47L30 (Primary) 47A13 (Secondary)"
Homology of moduli spaces of curves and commutative homotopy algebras,"Takashi Kimura, Jim Stasheff, Alexander A.

This relationship generalizes one between commutative algebras and Lie algebras proposed by Lazard, Kontsevich and Ginzburg and Kapranov. More explicitly, we show that the cohomology of one moduli space is the graph complex decorated with the cohomology of the other, which in its turn generalizes Getzler's result for the genus zero moduli. We also show that a certain class of algebras over the chain operad of compactified moduli spaces has a natural structure of a commutative homotopy algebra.

We use D-brane theory to compare the formulation of RR-charged BPS algebras in type II compactification with the requirements of string/string duality and find that the RR charged BPS states should be regarded as cohomology classes on moduli spaces of coherent sheaves. The equivalence of the algebra of BPS states in heterotic/IIA dual pairs elucidates certain results and conjectures of Nakajima and Gritsenko & Nikulin, on geometrically defined algebras and furthermore suggests nontrivial generalizations of these algebras.

The talented monoid of a Leavitt path algebra,"Roozbeh Hazrat, Huanhuan Li","There is a tight relation between the geometry of a directed graph and the algebraic structure of a Leavitt path algebra associated to it. In this note, we show a similar connection between the geometry of the graph and the structure of a certain monoid associated to it. This monoid is isomorphic to the positive cone of the graded K0-group of the Leavitt path algebra which is naturally equipped with a Z-action. As an example, we show that a graph has a cycle without an exit if and only if the monoid has a periodic element. Consequently a graph has Condition (L) if and only if the group Z acts freely on the monoid. We go on to show that the algebraic structure of Leavitt path algebras (such as simplicity, purely infinite simplicity, or the lattice of ideals) can be described completely via this monoid. Therefore an isomorphism between the monoids (or graded K0's) of two Leavitt path algebras implies that the algebras have similar algebraic structures. These all confirm that the graded Grothendieck group could be a sought-after complete invariant for the classification of Leavitt path algebras.",2019-03-22T08:58:33Z,2019-03-22T08:58:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09406v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09406v1,"math.RA, 18B40, 16D25"
Explicit smooth real algebraic functions which may have both compact and   non-compact preimages on smooth real algebraic manifolds,Naoki Kitazawa,"In our previous work, we have constructed explicit smooth real algebraic functions which may have both compact and non-compact preimages on smooth real algebraic manifolds.

Our result is new in obtaining non-proper smooth real algebraic functions on smooth real algebraic manifolds satisfying explicit conditions on (non-)compactness of preimages whereas previously the manifolds are only semi-algebraic. Explicitly, this mainly contributes to two different regions of mathematics. One is singularity theory of differentiable maps and applications to differential topology.

Symplectic four dimensional Lie algebras are described either as solutions of the cotangent extension problem or as symplectic double extension of $\Bbb RR^2$ by $\Bbb RR$. The difference in the choice of a certain model lies on the existence or not of a lagrangian ideal. Moreover all extensions of a two dimensional Lie algebra are determined, and so all solutions (up to equivalence) of the cotangent extension problem are given in dimension two.

A non-degenerate Hermitian metric gives a star structure on this algebra, and an additional star operation on the line bundle gives a star operation on the N graded algebra. In this case, we can carry out the associated circle bundle and Thom constructions.

They have applications in mathematical physics, especially in extended geometry and gauged supergravity. We further develop the recently proposed definition of tensor hierarchy algebras in terms of generators and relations encoded in a Dynkin diagram (which coincides with the diagram for a related Borcherds superalgebra). We apply it to cases where a grey node is added to the Dynkin diagram of a rank $r+1$ Kac-Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}^+$, which in turn is an extension of a rank $r$ finite-dimensional semisimple simply laced Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The algebras are specified by $\mathfrak{g}$ together with a dominant integral weight $\lambda$. As a by-product, a remarkable identity involving representation matrices for arbitrary integral highest weight representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ is proven.

Algebraic hyperbolicity for surfaces in smooth projective toric   threefolds with Picard rank 2 and 3,Sharon Robins,"Algebraic hyperbolicity serves as a bridge between differential geometry and algebraic geometry. Generally, it is difficult to show that a given projective variety is algebraically hyperbolic. However, it was established recently that a very general surface of degree at least five in projective space is algebraically hyperbolic. We are interested in generalizing the study of surfaces in projective space to surfaces in smooth projective toric threefolds with Picard rank 2 or 3. Following Kleinschmidt and Batyrev, we explore the combinatorial description of smooth projective toric threefolds with Picard rank 2 and 3. We then use Haase and Ilten's method of finding algebraically hyperbolic surfaces in toric threefolds.

In this article we prove that for emergent algebras the condition (COLIN), or right-distributivity for emergent algebras, implies (LIN), or left-distributivity for emergent algebras. It means that any emergent algebra which is right-distributive has to come from a commutative group endowed with a family of dilations.

From a categorical perspective, these one-parameter families of finite-dimensional algebras ""absorb"" the singularities of the threefold total spaces of smoothings. These results were established using abstract methods of birational geometry, making the explicit computation of the family of algebras challenging. Using mirror symmetry for genus-one fibrations, we identify a remarkable immersed Lagrangian with a bounding cochain in the punctured torus.

Rigid Lie algebras and algebraicity,Elisabeth Remm,"The notion of rigidity of Lie algebra is linked to the following problem: when does a Lie brackets $\mu$ on a vector space g satisfy that every Lie bracket $\mu_1$ sufficiently close to $\mu$ is of the form $\mu_1 = P.\mu $ for some P in GL(g) close to the identity? A Lie algebra which satisfies the above condition will be called rigid. The most famous example is the Lie algebra sl(2,C) of square matrices of order $2$ with vanishing trace. This Lie algebra is rigid, that is any close deformation is isomorphic to it. Let us note that, for this Lie algebra, there exists a quantification of its universal algebra. This led to the definition of the famous quantum group SL(2). Another interest of studying the rigid Lie algebras is the fact that there exists, for a given dimension, only a finite number of isomorphic classes of rigid Lie algebras. So we are tempted to establish a classification. This problem has been solved up to the dimension 8. To continue in this direction, properties must be established on the structure of these algebras. One of the first results establishes an algebraicity criterion \cite{Carles}. However, the notion of algebraicity which is used is not the classical notion and it includes non-algebraic Lie algebras in the usual sense. The aim of this work is to show that a the Lie algebra is rigid, then its algebra of inner derivations is algebraic.",2019-07-11T05:36:15Z,2019-07-11T05:36:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05003v1,"math.RA, 17B05"
On some approaches towards non-commutative algebraic geometry,Snigdhayan Mahanta,"The works of R. Descartes, I. M. Gelfand and A. Grothendieck have convinced us that commutative rings should be thought of as rings of functions on some appropriate (commutative) spaces. If we try to push this notion forward we reach the realm of Non-commutative Geometry. The confluence of ideas comes here mainly from three seemingly disparate sources, namely, quantum physics, operator algebras (Connes-style) and algebraic geometry. Following the title of the article, an effort has been made to provide an overview of the third point of view. Since na\"" ive efforts to generalize commutative algebraic geometry fail, one goes to the root of the problem and tries to work things out ""categorically"". This makes the approach a little bit abstract but not abstruse. However, an honest confession must be made at the outset - this write-up is very far from being definitive; hopefully it will provide glimpses of some interesting developments at least.",2005-01-11T17:47:27Z,2006-11-01T17:54:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0501166v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0501166v5,"math.QA, math.AG"
Emergent Geometry from Quantized Spacetime,"Hyun Seok Yang, M. Sivakumar","We examine the picture of emergent geometry arising from a mass-deformed matrix model. Because of the mass-deformation, a vacuum geometry turns out to be a constant curvature spacetime such as d-dimensional sphere and (anti-)de Sitter spaces. We show that the mass-deformed matrix model giving rise to the constant curvature spacetime can be derived from the d-dimensional Snyder algebra. The emergent geometry beautifully confirms all the rationale inferred from the algebraic point of view that the d-dimensional Snyder algebra is equivalent to the Lorentz algebra in (d+1)-dimensional {\it flat} spacetime. For example, a vacuum geometry of the mass-deformed matrix model is completely described by a G-invariant metric of coset manifolds G/H defined by the Snyder algebra. We also discuss a nonlinear deformation of the Snyder algebra.",2009-08-20T08:56:52Z,2010-08-05T03:41:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2809v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.2809v4,"hep-th, gr-qc, hep-ph"

Codes and the Cartier Operator,Alain Couvreur,"In this article, we present a new construction of codes from algebraic curves.

This new class of codes can be regarded as a natural geometric generalisation of classical Goppa codes. In particular, we prove that a well-known property satisfied by classical Goppa codes extends naturally to Cartier codes. We prove general lower bounds for the dimension and the minimum distance of these codes and compare our construction with a classical one: the subfield subcodes of Algebraic Geometry codes. We prove that every Cartier code is contained in a subfield subcode of an Algebraic Geometry code and that the two constructions have similar asymptotic performances.   We also show that some known results on subfield subcodes of Algebraic Geometry codes can be proved nicely by using properties of the Cartier operator and that some known bounds on the dimension of subfield subcodes of Algebraic Geometry codes can be improved thanks to Cartier codes and the Cartier operator.",2012-06-20T21:50:28Z,2012-09-10T19:32:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4728v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4728v2,"math.NT, cs.IT, math.AG, math.IT, 11G20, 14G50, 94B27"

Supermatrix Representations of Semigroup Bands,Steven Duplij,Various semigroups of noninvertible supermatrices of the special (antitriangle) shape having nilpotent Berezinian which appear in supersymmetric theories are defined and investigated. A subset of them continuously represents left and right zero semigroups and rectangular bands. The ideal properties of higher order rectangular band analogs and the ``wreath'' version of them are studied in detail.

In this paper, we prove that the associated infinity category of dg-manifolds is equivalent to that of derived manifolds. This allows the well developed theory of dg-geometry to live in symbiosis with infinity categorical approach to derived differential geometry.

Gauging the Carroll Algebra and Ultra-Relativistic Gravity,Jelle Hartong,"It is well known that the geometrical framework of Riemannian geometry that underlies general relativity and its torsionful extension to Riemann-Cartan geometry can be obtained from a procedure known as gauging the Poincare algebra. Recently it has been shown that gauging the centrally extended Galilei algebra, known as the Bargmann algebra, leads to a geometrical framework that when made dynamical gives rise to Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Here we consider the case where we contract the Poincare algebra by sending the speed of light to zero leading to the Carroll algebra. We show how this algebra can be gauged and we construct the most general affine connection leading to the geometry of so-called Carrollian space-times. Carrollian space-times appear for example as the geometry on null hypersurfaces in a Lorentzian space-time of one dimension higher. We also construct theories of ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) gravity in 2+1 dimensions with dynamical exponent z<1 including cases that have anisotropic Weyl invariance for z=0.",2015-05-19T14:25:48Z,2015-05-19T14:25:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05011v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05011v1,"hep-th, gr-qc"

The relevant underlying algebraic structure turns out to be a tensor hierarchy algebra rather than a Borcherds superalgebra. This tensor hierarchy algebra is a non-contragredient superalgebra, generically infinite-dimensional, which is a double extension of the structure algebra of the extended geometry. We use it to perform a (partial) analysis of the gauge structure in terms of an $L_\infty$ algebra for extended geometries based on finite-dimensional structure groups. An invariant pseudo-action is also given in these cases. We comment on the continuation to infinite-dimensional structure groups. An accompanying paper deals with the mathematical construction of the tensor hierarchy algebras.",2019-08-23T07:10:09Z,2019-08-23T07:10:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08696v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08696v1,hep-th

We provide examples including ""three-algebra geometries"", which encode the structure constants for three-algebras and in some cases give novel uplifts for $CSO(p,q,r)$ gaugings of seven-dimensional maximal supergravity.

On complex and symplectic toric stacks,"Andreas Hochenegger, Frederik Witt","Toric varieties play an important role both in symplectic and complex geometry. In symplectic geometry, the construction of a symplectic toric manifold from a smooth polytope is due to Delzant. In algebraic geometry, there is a more general construction using fans rather than polytopes. However, in case the fan is induced by a smooth polytope Audin showed both constructions to give isomorphic projective varieties. For rational but not necessarily smooth polytopes the Delzant construction was refined by Lerman and Tolman, leading to symplectic toric orbifolds or more generally, symplectic toric DM stacks (Lerman and Malkin). We show that the stacks resulting from the Lerman-Tolman construction are isomorphic to the stacks obtained by Borisov et al. in case the stacky fan is induced by a polytope. No originality is claimed (cf. also an article by Sakai). Rather we hope that this text serves as an example driven introduction to symplectic toric geometry for the algebraically minded reader.",2011-05-31T13:52:02Z,2012-10-08T07:15:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6280v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.6280v3,"math.AG, math.SG, 14M25, 53D20, 14D23"
Modular operads and Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry,Serguei Barannikov,"This is a copy of the article published in IMRN (2007). I describe the noncommutative Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry associated naturally with arbitrary modular operad.

I show, in particular, that the algebras over the Feynman transform of a twisted modular operad P are in one-to-one correspondence with solutions to quantum master equation of Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry on the affine P-manifolds. As an application I give a construction of characteristic classes with values in the homology of the quotient of Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces. These classes are associated naturally with solutions to the quantum master equation on affine S[t]-manifolds, where S[t] is the twisted modular Det-operad constructed from symmetric groups, which generalizes the cyclic operad of associative algebras.",2017-10-23T18:23:21Z,2017-10-25T12:58:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08442v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08442v2,"math.QA, math.AG, math.SG"
"Graded Geometry, $Q$-Manifolds, and Microformal Geometry",Theodore Th. Voronov,"We give an exposition of graded and microformal geometry, and the language of $Q$-manifolds. $Q$-manifolds are supermanifolds endowed with an odd vector field of square zero. They can be seen as a non-linear analogue of Lie algebras (in parallel with even and odd Poisson manifolds), a basis of ""non-linear homological algebra"", and a powerful tool for describing algebraic and geometric structures. This language goes together with that of graded manifolds, which are supermanifolds with an extra $\mathbb{Z}$-grading in the structure sheaf. ""Microformal geometry"" is a new notion referring to ""thick"" or ""microformal"" morphisms, which generalize ordinary smooth maps, but whose crucial feature is that the corresponding pullbacks of functions are nonlinear. In particular, ""Poisson thick morphisms"" of homotopy Poisson supermanifolds induce $L_{\infty}$-morphisms of homotopy Poisson brackets.

The Landscape of Multi-Layer Linear Neural Network From the Perspective   of Algebraic Geometry,Xiuyi Yang,"The clear understanding of the non-convex landscape of neural network is a complex incomplete problem. This paper studies the landscape of linear (residual) network, the simplified version of the nonlinear network. By treating the gradient equations as polynomial equations, we use algebraic geometry tools to solve it over the complex number field, the attained solution can be decomposed into different irreducible complex geometry objects. Then three hypotheses are proposed, involving how to calculate the loss on each irreducible geometry object, the losses of critical points have a certain range and the relationship between the dimension of each irreducible geometry object and strict saddle condition. Finally, numerical algebraic geometry is applied to verify the rationality of these three hypotheses which further clarify the landscape of linear network and the role of residual connection.",2021-01-30T04:50:45Z,2021-01-30T04:50:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04338v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04338v1,"math.AG, cs.LG"

Hence, the work of Belavin and Drinfeld on solutions of the Classical Yang-Baxter Equation on simple Lie algebras, applied to the particular case of sl(m, K) alone, paves the way to the complete classification of Frobenius and more generally quasi-Frobenius Lie algebras. We prove that, if a Frobenius Lie algebra has the property that every derivation is an inner derivation, then every principal element is semisimple, at least for K=C.   As an important case, we prove that in the Lie algebra of the group of affine motions of the Euclidean space of finite dimension, every derivation is inner.

We study support equivalence and the universal Hopf algebras mentioned above for group gradings, Hopf-Galois extensions, actions of algebraic groups and cocommutative Hopf algebras. We show how the notion of support equivalence can be used to reduce the classification problem of Hopf algebra (co)actions. We apply support equivalence in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of codimensions of H-identities and, in particular, to the analogue (formulated by Yu. A.

Efficiently repairing algebraic geometry codes,"Lingfei Jin, Yuan Luo, Chaoping Xing","Minimum storage regenerating codes have minimum storage of data in each node and therefore are maximal distance separable (MDS for short) codes. Thus, the number of nodes is upper bounded by $2^{\fb}$, where $\fb$ is the bits of data stored in each node. From both theoretical and practical points of view (see the details in Section 1), it is natural to consider regenerating codes that nearly have minimum storage of data, and meanwhile the number of nodes is unbounded. One of the candidates for such regenerating codes is an algebraic geometry code. In this paper, we generalize the repairing algorithm of Reed-Solomon codes given in \cite[STOC2016]{GW16} to algebraic geometry codes and present an efficient repairing algorithm for arbitrary one-point algebraic geometry codes. By applying our repairing algorithm to the one-point algebraic geometry codes based on the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower, one can repair a code of rate $1-\Ge$ and length $n$ over $\F_{q}$ with bandwidth $(n-1)(1-\Gt)\log q$ for any $\Ge=2^{(\Gt-1/2)\log q}$ with a real $\tau\in(0,1/2)$. In addition, storage in each node for an algebraic geometry code is close to the minimum storage. Due to nice structures of Hermitian curves, repairing of Hermitian codes is also investigated. As a result, we are able to show that algebraic geometry codes are regenerating codes with good parameters. An example reveals that Hermitian codes outperform Reed-Solomon codes for certain parameters.",2017-10-05T03:42:28Z,2017-10-05T03:42:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01874v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01874v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Differential geometry and general relativity with algebraifolds,Tobias Fritz,"It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of ""algebraifold"", by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring. Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.

The generalized differential geometry of space-time is constructed in terms of the algebra A (and its derivations) on a transformation groupoid. Regular representation {\pi} of A in the algebra of bounded operators on a bundle of Hilbert spaces leads to the algebra \pi(A) = M_0 which can be completed to the von Neumann algebra M . The representation \pi establishes the isomorphism between A and M_0 which, in turn, implies the isomorphism between moduli of their derivations. In this way, geometry naturally transfers to the algebra M_0 and its derivations. Although geometry, as defined in terms of M_0, is formally isomorphic to that defined in terms of A, it exhibits a strong probabilistic flavour. However, the geometry of M_0 does not prolong to M . This is clearly a serious stumbling block to fully unify mathematical tools of general relativity and quantum theory.",2012-07-03T08:10:04Z,2013-01-05T16:02:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0601v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0601v3,"math-ph, math.MP, 81R60 (Primary) 18F20, 20L05, 47B80 (Secondary)"
"Algebraic combinatorial geometry: the polynomial method in arithmetic   combinatorics, incidence combinatorics, and number theory",Terence Tao,"Arithmetic combinatorics is often concerned with the problem of bounding the behaviour of arbitrary finite sets in a group or ring with respect to arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication. Similarly, combinatorial geometry is often concerned with the problem of bounding the behaviour of arbitrary finite collections of geometric objects such as points, lines, or circles with respect to geometric operations such as incidence or distance. Given the presence of arbitrary finite sets in these problems, the methods used to attack these problems have primarily been combinatorial in nature. In recent years, however, many outstanding problems in these questions have been solved by algebraic means (and more specifically, using tools from algebraic geometry and/or algebraic topology), giving rise to an emerging set of techniques which is now known as the polynomial method.   While various instances of the polynomial method have been known for decades (e.g. Stepanov's method, the combinatorial nullstellensatz, or Baker's theorem), the general theory of this method is still in the process of maturing; in particular, the limitations of the polynomial method are not well understood, and there is still considerable scope to apply deeper results from algebraic geometry or algebraic topology to strengthen the method further. In this survey we present several of the known applications of these methods, focusing on the simplest cases to illustrate the techniques. We will assume as little prior knowledge of algebraic geometry as possible.",2013-10-24T04:39:44Z,2014-03-29T16:13:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6482v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.6482v5,"math.CO, math.AG, math.NT, 05B25, 11T06, 12D10, 51H10"
"Explicit non-special divisors of small degree, algebraic geometric   hulls, and LCD codes from Kummer extensions","Eduardo Camps, Hiram H. López, Gretchen L. Matthews","In this paper, we consider the hull of an algebraic geometry code, meaning the intersection of the code and its dual. We demonstrate how codes whose hulls are algebraic geometry codes may be defined using only rational places of Kummer extensions (and Hermitian function fields in particular). Our primary tool is explicitly constructing non-special divisors of degrees $g$ and $g-1$ on certain families of function fields with many rational places, accomplished by appealing to Weierstrass semigroups. We provide explicit algebraic geometry codes with hulls of specified dimensions, producing along the way linearly complementary dual algebraic geometric codes from the Hermitian function field (among others) using only rational places and an answer to an open question posed by Ballet and Le Brigand for particular function fields. These results complement earlier work by Mesnager, Tang, and Qi that use lower-genus function fields as well as instances using places of a higher degree from Hermitian function fields to construct linearly complementary dual (LCD) codes and that of Carlet, Mesnager, Tang, Qi, and Pellikaan to provide explicit algebraic geometry codes with the LCD property rather than obtaining codes via monomial equivalences.",2021-12-26T17:57:44Z,2024-02-04T02:23:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13424v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13424v3,"cs.IT, math.AG, math.IT, 94B05, 11T71, 14G50"

Global geometric deformations of current algebras as Krichever-Novikov   type algebras,"Alice Fialowski, Martin Schlichenmaier","We construct algebraic-geometric families of genus one (i.e. elliptic) current and affine Lie algebras of Krichever-Novikov type. These families deform the classical current, respectively affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras. The construction is induced by the geometric process of degenerating the elliptic curve to singular cubics. If the finite-dimensional Lie algebra defining the infinite dimensional current algebra is simple then, even if restricted to local families, the constructed families are non-equivalent to the trivial family. In particular, we show that the current algebra is geometrically not rigid, despite its formal rigidity. This shows that in the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra case the relations between geometric deformations, formal deformations and Lie algebra two-cohomology are not that close as in the finite-dimensional case. The constructed families are e.g. of relevance in the global operator approach to the Wess-Zumino-Witten-Novikov models appearing in the quantization of Conformal Field Theory.",2004-12-06T14:17:55Z,2004-12-06T14:17:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0412113v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0412113v1,"math.QA, math-ph, math.AG, math.MP, math.RA, 17B66; 17B56; 17B65; 17B68; 14D15; 14H52; 30F30, 81T40"
Almost-graded central extensions of Lax operator algebra,Martin Schlichenmaier,"Lax operator algebras constitute a new class of infinite dimensional Lie algebras of geometric origin. More precisely, they are algebras of matrices whose entries are meromorphic functions on a compact Riemann surface. They generalize classical current algebras and current algebras of Krichever-Novikov type. Lax operators for $\gl(n)$, with the spectral parameter on a Riemann surface, were introduced by Krichever. In joint works of Krichever and Sheinman their algebraic structure was revealed and extended to more general groups. These algebras are almost-graded. In this article their definition is recalled and classification and uniqueness results for almost-graded central extensions for this new class of algebras are presented. The explicit forms of the defining cocycles are given. If the finite-dimensional Lie algebra on which the Lax operator algebra is based is simple then, up to equivalence and rescaling of the central element, there is a unique non-trivial almost-graded central extension.

Weighted Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras,Ben Webster,"In this paper, we define a generalization of Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras which we call weighted Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras. We show that these algebras carry many of the same structures as the original Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras, including induction and restriction functors which induce a twisted biaglebra structure on their Grothendieck groups.   We also define natural quotients of these algebras, which in an important special case carry a categorical action of an associated Lie algebra. Special cases of these include the algebras categorifying tensor products and Fock spaces defined by the author and Stroppel in past work.   For symmetric Cartan matrices, weighted KLR algebras also have a natural gometric interpretation as convolution algebras, generalizing that for the original KLR algebras by Varagnolo and Vasserot; this result has positivity consequences important in the theory of crystal bases.

We classify local cocycles of these current algebras, and compare them to central extensions of higher affine algebras recently proposed by Faonte-Hennion-Kapranov. A central goal of this paper is to witness higher Kac-Moody algebras as symmetries of a class of holomorphic quantum field theories. In particular, we prove a generalization of the free field realization of an affine Kac-Moody algebra and also develop the theory of q-characters for this class of algebras in terms of factorization homology.

Lie-Rinehart) splitting of a Lie-Rinehart algebra extension, we provide a crossed (resp. smash) product decomposition of the associated universal enveloping algebra, and vice versa.

Automorphism groupoids in noncommutative projective geometry,"Nicholas Cooney, Jan E. Grabowski","We address a natural question in noncommutative geometry, namely the rigidity observed in many examples, whereby noncommutative spaces (or equivalently their coordinate algebras) have very few automorphisms by comparison with their commutative counterparts.   In the framework of noncommutative projective geometry, we define a groupoid whose objects are noncommutative projective spaces of a given dimension and whose morphisms correspond to isomorphisms of these. This groupoid is then a natural generalization of an automorphism group. Using work of Zhang, we may translate this structure to the algebraic side, wherein we consider homogeneous coordinate algebras of noncommutative projective spaces. The morphisms in our groupoid precisely correspond to the existence of a Zhang twist relating the two coordinate algebras.   We analyse this automorphism groupoid, showing that in dimension 1 it is connected, so that every noncommutative $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ is isomorphic to commutative $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. For dimension 2 and above, we use the geometry of the point scheme, as introduced by Artin-Tate-Van den Bergh, to relate morphisms in our groupoid to certain automorphisms of the point scheme.   We apply our results to two important examples, quantum projective spaces and Sklyanin algebras. In both cases, we are able to use the geometry of the point schemes to fully describe the corresponding component of the automorphism groupoid. This provides a concrete description of the collection of Zhang twists of these algebras.",2018-07-17T12:32:53Z,2022-04-21T09:02:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06383v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06383v4,"math.RA, math.QA, 16S38 (Primary) 16D90, 16W50, 20G42 (Secondary)"

Algebras containing a common ideal of codimension 1 can be characterized by homothetically normalized Jordan normal forms of one generator of their adjoint representation. For such algebras, transitions A -> B can be described by limit transitions between corresponding normal forms. The topology k^n is presented in detail for n < 5.

Such maps, called evolutions, arise naturally in the study of Hecke algebras, as they implicitly do in the recent work of Wiles, Taylor-Wiles, and Flach. We show that the existence of non-trivial evolutions of an algebra $T$ can be characterized in terms of the symbolic square of an ideal defining $T$.

Using this and other techniques we show that certain classes of reduced algebras -- codimension 2 Cohen-Macaulay, Codimension 3 Gorenstein, licci algebras in general, and some others -- admit no nontrivial evolutions.

Moreover we state that, with the exception of lines passing through the focus, the conchoid always has at least one simple component and that, for almost every distance, all the components of the conchoid are simple. We state that, in the reducible case, simple conchoid components are birationally equivalent to the initial curve, and we show how special components can be used to decide whether a given algebraic curve is the conchoid of another curve.",2007-05-31T12:40:32Z,2007-05-31T12:40:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4590v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.4590v1,math.AG

Quantum Ultrametrics on AF Algebras and The Gromov-Hausdorff Propinquity,"Konrad Aguilar, Frederic Latremoliere","We construct quantum metric structures on unital AF algebras with a faithful tracial state, and prove that for such metrics, AF algebras are limits of their defining inductive sequences of finite dimensional C*-algebras for the quantum propinquity. We then study the geometry, for the quantum propinquity, of three natural classes of AF algebras equipped with our quantum metrics: the UHF algebras, the Effros-Shen AF algebras associated with continued fraction expansions of irrationals, and the Cantor space, on which our construction recovers traditional ultrametrics. We also exhibit several compact classes of AF algebras for the quantum propinquity and show continuity of our family of Lip-norms on a fixed AF algebra. Our work thus brings AF algebras into the realm of noncommutative metric geometry.",2015-11-23T05:52:58Z,2016-05-17T16:37:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07114v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07114v3,"math.OA, math.FA, Primary: 46L89, 46L30, 58B34"
"Lie-Butcher series, Geometry, Algebra and Computation","Hans Z. Munthe-Kaas, Kristoffer K. Føllesdal","Lie-Butcher (LB) series are formal power series expressed in terms of trees and forests. On the geometric side LB-series generalizes classical B-series from Euclidean spaces to Lie groups and homogeneous manifolds. On the algebraic side, B-series are based on pre-Lie algebras and the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra. The LB-series are instead based on post-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras. Over the last decade the algebraic theory of LB-series has matured. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we aim at presenting the algebraic structures underlying LB series in a concise and self contained manner. Secondly, we review a number of algebraic operations on LB-series found in the literature, and reformulate these as recursive formulae. This is part of an ongoing effort to create an extensive software library for computations in LB-series and B-series in the programming language Haskell.",2017-01-13T12:59:54Z,2017-10-27T09:18:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03654v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03654v2,"math.NA, math.CO, math.DG, math.RA, 65L99, 16T05"
Roe algebras of coarse spaces via coarse geometric modules,"Diego Martínez, Federico Vigolo","We provide a construction of Roe (C*-)algebras of general coarse spaces in terms of coarse geometric modules. This extends the classical theory of Roe algebras of metric spaces and gives a unified framework to deal with either uniform or non-uniform Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators; both in the metric and general coarse geometric setting. The key new definitions are that of coarse geometric module and coarse support of operators between coarse geometric modules. These let us construct natural bridges between coarse geometry and operator algebras.   We then study the general structure of Roe-like algebras, and investigate several structural properties, such as admitting Cartan subalgebras or computing their intersection with the compact operators. Lastly, we prove that assigning to a coarse space the K-theory groups of its Roe algebra(s) is a natural functorial operation.",2023-12-14T13:12:19Z,2024-04-02T09:00:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08907v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08907v2,"math.OA, math.MG, 46L80, 54E15 (Primary) 46L85, 51K05, 51F30 (Secondary)"

As a corollary, the Lazard ring given by products of projective spaces rationally generates all nonsingular projective varieties modulo double point degenerations. Double point degenerations arise naturally in relative Donaldson-Thomas theory.

Our construction depends on the choice of an algebraic model for $\mathcal{T}$ (a tensor Frobenius pair), which has to satisfy a $\mathrm{K}$-theoretic regularity condition analogous to the Gersten conjecture from algebraic geometry. In this situation, we are able to prove an analogue of the Bloch formula and use it to define an intersection product similar to a construction by Grayson. We then recover the usual intersection product on a non-singular algebraic variety assuming a $\mathrm{K}$-theoretic compatibility condition.",2015-05-28T09:49:56Z,2015-05-28T09:49:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07615v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07615v1,"math.CT, math.AG, math.KT"

Computation of the component group of an arbitrary real algebraic group,Dmitry A.

Introduction of Probabilistic Algebraic Variety,Naoya Maeda,"Historically, probability theory has been studied for a long time, and Kolmogorov, Levy Ito Kiyoshi, and others have mathematically developed modern probability in conjunction with measurement theory. On the other hand, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry have historically been the subject of interdisciplinary research led by Grothendiek. Many Japanese, notably Matsumura, Hironaka, and Kodaira, have contributed to this field. This paper is an attempt to focus on the research theme of Professor Sumio Watanabe of Tokyo Institute of Technology, ""Algebraic Geometry and Probability Theory,"" from my own perspective. The mathematical theory development starts from Kolmogorov's axioms, and the proof and introduction of ""Probabilistic Algebraic Variety"" are given. Problems in computation and applications, analysis by computational homology, and unsolved problems in regression problems will be introduced as applications to statistics.",2023-12-29T09:04:06Z,2023-12-29T09:04:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17521v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17521v1,math.GM

These results are required in the paper ""A Theory of Branches for Algebraic Curves"",(*), where, following Severi, we introduced the notion of the ""branch"" of an algebraic curve. Secondly, we use results from the cited paper, (*), in order to develop a refined theory of g_{n}^{r} on an algebraic curve. The refinement depends critically on relacing the notion of a point with a branch. This allows us to construct a theory of divisors, \emph{generalising} the corresponding theory in the special case when the algebraic curve is non-singular, which is birationally invariant.",2007-03-10T18:16:15Z,2007-03-10T18:16:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703290v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0703290v1,"math.AG, math.LO"
Algebraic statistical models,"Mathias Drton, Seth Sullivant","Many statistical models are algebraic in that they are defined in terms of polynomial constraints, or in terms of polynomial or rational parametrizations. The parameter spaces of such models are typically semi-algebraic subsets of the parameter space of a reference model with nice properties, such as for example a regular exponential family. This observation leads to the definition of an `algebraic exponential family'. This new definition provides a unified framework for the study of statistical models with algebraic structure. In this paper we review the ingredients to this definition and illustrate in examples how computational algebraic geometry can be used to solve problems arising in statistical inference in algebraic models.",2007-03-20T19:57:45Z,2007-03-20T19:57:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703609v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0703609v1,"math.ST, stat.TH"
Diophantine Approximation on varieties III: Approximation of   non-algebraic points by algebraic points,Heinrich Massold,"For $\theta$ a non-algebraic point on a quasi projective variety over a number field, I prove that $\theta$ has an approximation by a series of algebraic points of bounded height and degree which is essentially best possible.

Algebraic Degree of Polynomial Optimization,"Jiawang Nie, Kristian Ranestad","Consider the polynomial optimization problem whose objective and constraints are all described by multivariate polynomials.

We also give a general formula for the algebraic degree of the optimal coordinates. The derivation of the algebraic degree is equivalent to counting the number of all complex critical points. As special cases, we obtain the algebraic degrees of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), second order cone programming (SOCP) and $p$-th order cone programming (pOCP), in analogy to the algebraic degree of semidefinite programming.",2008-02-09T00:11:30Z,2008-02-09T00:11:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1233v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1233v1,"math.OC, math.AG"

Nonunimodular Lorentzian flat Lie algebras,"Mohamed Boucetta, Hicham Lebzioui","A Lorentzian flat Lie group is a Lie group $G$ with a flat left invariant metric $\mu$ with signature $(1,n-1)=(-,+,\ldots,+)$.

It is known that the metric of a flat Lorentzian Lie group is geodesically complete if and only if its Lie algebra is unimodular. In this paper, we characterise nonunimodular Lorentzian flat Lie algebras as double extensions (in the sense of Aubert-Medina \cite{Aub-Med}) of Riemannian flat Lie algebras.

The relation type of affine algebras and algebraic varieties,Francesc Planas-Vilanova,"We introduce the notion of relation type of an affine algebra and prove that it is well defined by using the Jacobi-Zariski exact sequence of Andr\'e-Quillen homology.

Also as a consequence of the invariance, we show that in order to calculate the relation type of an ideal in a polynomial ring one can reduce the problem to trinomial ideals. When the relation type is at least two, the extreme equidimensional components play no role.

We show, however, that it also holds when $X$ is replaced by many examples of algebraic stacks which are not proper, including many global quotient stacks. This leads us to revisit the definition of properness for stacks.   We introduce the notion of a formally proper morphism of stacks and study its properties. We develop methods for establishing formal properness in a large class of examples. Along the way, we prove strong h-descent results which hold in the setting of derived algebraic geometry but not in classical algebraic geometry.

Electric-magnetic Duality in Noncommutative Geometry,"Fedele Lizzi, Richard J. Szabo",The structure of S-duality in U(1) gauge theory on a 4-manifold M is examined using the formalism of noncommutative geometry. A noncommutative space is constructed from the algebra of Wilson-'t Hooft line operators which encodes both the ordinary geometry of M and its infinite-dimensional loop space geometry. S-duality is shown to act as an inner automorphism of the algebra and arises as a consequence of the existence of two independent Dirac operators associated with the spaces of self-dual and anti-selfdual 2-forms on M. The relations with the noncommutative geometry of string theory and T-duality are also discussed.,1997-09-28T20:00:34Z,1997-09-28T20:00:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9709198v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9709198v1,hep-th

Is there a Jordan geometry underlying quantum physics?,Wolfgang Bertram,"There have been several propositions for a geometric and essentially non-linear formulation of quantum mechanics. From a purely mathematical point of view, the point of view of Jordan algebra theory might give new strength to such approaches: there is a ``Jordan geometry'' belonging to the Jordan part of the algebra of observables, in the same way as Lie groups belong to the Lie part. Both the Lie geometry and the Jordan geometry are well-adapted to describe certain features of quantum theory.

Birational Geometry of Toric Varieties,Edilaine Ervilha Nobili,"Toric geometry provides a bridge between algebraic geometry and combinatorics of fans and polytopes. For each polarized toric variety (X,L) we have associated a polytope P. In this thesis we use this correspondence to study birational geometry for toric varieties. To this end, we address subjects such as Minimal Model Program, Mori fiber spaces, and chamber structures on the cone of effective divisors. We translate some results from these theories to the combinatorics of polytopes and use them to get structure theorems on space of polytopes.

A Serre-Swan theorem for bundles of bounded geometry,Jens Kaad,The Serre-Swan theorem in differential geometry establishes an equivalence between the category of smooth vector bundles over a smooth compact manifold and the category of finitely generated projective modules over the unital ring of smooth functions. This theorem is here generalized to manifolds of bounded geometry. In this context it states that the category of Hilbert bundles of bounded geometry is equivalent to the category of operator *-modules over the operator *-algebra of continuously differentiable functions which vanish at infinity. Operator *-modules are generalizations of Hilbert C*-modules where C*-algebras have been replaced by a more flexible class of involutive algebras of bounded operators: Operator *-algebras.

"On post-Lie algebras, Lie--Butcher series and moving frames","Hans Munthe-Kaas, Alexander Lundervold","Pre-Lie (or Vinberg) algebras arise from flat and torsion-free connections on differential manifolds. They have been studied extensively in recent years, both from algebraic operadic points of view and through numerous applications in numerical analysis, control theory, stochastic differential equations and renormalization. Butcher series are formal power series founded on pre-Lie algebras, used in numerical analysis to study geometric properties of flows on euclidean spaces. Motivated by the analysis of flows on manifolds and homogeneous spaces, we investigate algebras arising from flat connections with constant torsion, leading to the definition of post-Lie algebras, a generalization of pre-Lie algebras. Whereas pre-Lie algebras are intimately associated with euclidean geometry, post-Lie algebras occur naturally in the differential geometry of homogeneous spaces, and are also closely related to Cartan's method of moving frames. Lie--Butcher series combine Butcher series with Lie series and are used to analyze flows on manifolds. In this paper we show that Lie--Butcher series are founded on post-Lie algebras. The functorial relations between post-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras, called D-algebras, are explored. Furthermore, we develop new formulas for computations in free post-Lie algebras and D-algebras, based on recursions in a magma, and we show that Lie--Butcher series are related to invariants of curves described by moving frames.",2012-03-21T14:03:30Z,2013-06-26T07:20:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4738v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4738v3,"math.NA, math.QA, 65L, 53C, 16T"

Lie Admissible Triple Algebras: The Connection Algebra of Symmetric   Spaces,"Hans Munthe-Kaas, Jonatan Stava","Associated to a symmetric space there is a canonical connection with zero torsion and parallel curvature. This connection acts as a binary operator on the vector space of smooth sections of the tangent bundle, and it is linear with respect to the real numbers. Thus the smooth section of the tangent bundle together with the connection form an algebra we call the connection algebra. The constraints of zero torsion and constant curvature makes the connection algebra into a Lie admissible triple algebra. This is a type of algebra that generalises pre-Lie algebras, and it can be embedded into a post-Lie algebra in a canonical way that generalises the canonical embedding of Lie triple systems into Lie algebras. The free Lie admissible triple algebra can be described by incorporating triple-brackets into the leaves of rooted (non-planar) trees.",2023-06-27T16:07:13Z,2024-07-25T07:37:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15582v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15582v3,"math.DG, 53C05 (primary), 17D25, 05C05, 53C35"

We provide a complete characterization, along with a broad class of examples, of real left symmetric algebras that possess a positive definite Koszul form. In particular, we show that for a left symmetric algebra with positive definite Koszul form being commutative or associative or Novikov implies that this algebra is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with its canonical product.   Beyond their algebraic interest, we show that any real left symmetric algebra $(\mathfrak{g}, \bullet)$ with a positive definite Koszul form induces a K\""ahler-Einstein structure with negative scalar curvature on the tangent bundle $TG$ of any connected Lie group $G$ associated to $(\mathfrak{g}^-, [\;,\;])$.

Deformations and homotopy theory of Nijenhuis associative algebras,"Chao Song, Kai Wang, Yuanyuan Zhang, Guodong Zhou","This paper is the first in a series of works devoted to an operadic study of Nijenhuis structures, focusing on Nijenhuis associative algebras. We introduce the concept of homotopy Nijenhuis associative algebras and demonstrate that the differential graded (=dg) operad $\NjAoperad_{\infty}$ governing these structures serves as the minimal model of the operad $\NjAoperad$ for Nijenhuis associative algebras. Additionally, we determine the Koszul dual homotopy cooperad of $\NjAoperad$. We construct an $L_\infty$-algebra that controls the simultaneous deformations of associative products and Nijenhuis operators. The Maurer-Cartan elements of this $L_\infty$-algebra correspond bijectively to Nijenhuis associative algebra structures. From this, we derive a cochain complex (deformation complex) and an associated cohomology theory of Nijenhuis associative algebras. Finally, we explore the connection between homotopy relative Rota-Baxter associative algebras of weight $0$ and homotopy Nijenhuis associative algebras.

Smoothness of commutative Hopf algebras,"Kensuke Egami, Akira Masuoka, Kenta Suzuki","Hopf algebras, most generally in a semisimple abelian symmetric monoidal category, are here supposed to be commutative but not to be of finite-type, and their (equivariant) smoothness are discussed. Given a Hopf algebra $H$ in a category such as above, it is proved that the following are equivalent: (i) $H$ is smooth as an algebra; (ii) $H$ is smooth as an $H$-comodule algebra; (iii) the product morphism $S_H^2(H^+) \to H^+$ defined on the 2nd symmetric power is monic. Working over a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we prove: (1) every ordinary Hopf algebra, i.e., such in the category $\mathsf{Vec}$ of vector spaces, satisfies the equivalent conditions (i)--(iii) and some others; (2) every Hopf algebra in the category $\mathsf{sVec}$ of super-vector spaces has a certain property that is stronger than (i).

Algebraic Geometry over $C^\infty$-rings,Dominic Joyce,"If $X$ is a smooth manifold then the $\mathbb R$-algebra $C^\infty(X)$ of smooth functions $c:X\to\mathbb R$ is a $C^\infty$-$ring$. That is, for each smooth function $f:{\mathbb R}^n\to\mathbb R$ there is an $n$-fold operation $\Phi_f:C^\infty(X)^n\to C^\infty(X)$ acting by $\Phi_f:(c_1,\ldots,c_n)\mapsto f(c_1,...,c_n)$, and these operations $\Phi_f$ satisfy many natural identities. Thus, $C^\infty(X)$ actually has a far richer structure than the obvious $\mathbb R$-algebra structure.   We develop a version of algebraic geometry in which rings or algebras are replaced by $C^\infty$-rings. As schemes are the basic objects in algebraic geometry, the new basic objects are $C^\infty$-$schemes$, a category of geometric objects which generalize smooth manifolds, and whose morphisms generalize smooth maps. We also study quasicoherent and coherent sheaves on $C^\infty$-schemes, and $C^\infty$-$stacks$, in particular Deligne-Mumford $C^\infty$-stacks, a 2-category of geometric objects generalizing orbifolds.   This enables us to use the tools of algebraic geometry in differential geometry, and to describe singular spaces such as moduli spaces occurring in differential geometric problems. This paper forms the foundations of the author's new theory of ""derived differential geometry"", surveyed in arXiv:1206.4207 and in more detail in arXiv:1208.4948, which studies d-manifolds and d-orbifolds, ""derived"" versions of smooth manifolds and smooth orbifolds. Derived differential geometry has applications to areas of symplectic geometry involving moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves.   Many of these ideas are not new: $C^\infty$-rings and $C^\infty$-schemes have long been part of synthetic differential geometry. But we develop them in new directions.

On separation of variables and completeness of the Bethe ansatz for   quantum gl_N Gaudin model,"E. Mukhin, V. Tarasov, A. Varchenko","In this note, we discuss implications of the results obtained in [MTV4]. It was shown there that eigenvectors of the Bethe algebra of the quantum gl_N Gaudin model are in a one-to-one correspondence with Fuchsian differential operators with polynomial kernel. Here, we interpret this fact as a separation of variables in the gl_N Gaudin model. Having a Fuchsian differential operator with polynomial kernel, we construct the corresponding eigenvector of the Bethe algebra. It was shown in [MTV4] that the Bethe algebra has simple spectrum if the evaluation parameters of the Gaudin model are generic. In that case, our Bethe ansatz construction produces an eigenbasis of the Bethe algebra.",2007-12-06T15:59:43Z,2007-12-06T15:59:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0981v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.0981v1,"math.QA, math.AG"

Automorphism groups of algebraic curves with p-rank zero,"Massimo Giulietti, Gabor Korchmaros","In positive characteristic, algebraic curves can have many more automorphisms than expected from the classical Hurwitz's bound. There even exist algebraic curves of arbitrary high genus g with more than 16g^4 automorphisms. It has been observed on many occasions that the most anomalous examples invariably have zero p-rank. In this paper, the K-automorphism group Aut(X) of a zero 2-rank algebraic curve X defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic 2 is investigated. The main result is that if the curve has genus g greater than or equal to 2, and |Aut(X)|>24g^2, then Aut(X) has a fixed point on X, apart from few exceptions. In the exceptional cases the possibilities for Aut(X) and g are determined.",2008-01-22T17:27:12Z,2008-01-22T17:27:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3423v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3423v1,"math.AG, math.GR, 14H37"

An introduction to Lipschitz geometry of complex singularities,Anne Pichon,"The aim of this paper to introduce the reader to a recent point of view on the Lipschitz classifications of complex singularities. It presents the complete classification of Lipschitz geometry of complex plane curves singularities and in particular, it introduces the so-called bubble trick and bubble trick with jumps which are key tools to study Lipschitz geometry of germs. It describes also the thick-thin decomposition of a normal complex surface singularity and built two geometric decompositions of a normal surface germ into standard pieces which are invariant by respectively inner and outer bilipschitz homeomorphisms. This leads in particular to the complete classification of Lipschitz geometry for the inner metric.",2020-07-08T14:44:38Z,2020-07-08T14:44:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04160v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04160v1,"math.AG, math.MG, 14B05, 32S25, 32S05, 57M99"

The apolar algebra of a product of linear forms,"Michael DiPasquale, Zachary Flores, Chris Peterson","Apolarity is an important tool in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry which studies a form, $f$, by the action of polynomial differential operators on $f$. The quotient of all polynomial differential operators by those which annihilate $f$ is called the apolar algebra of $f$. In general, the apolar algebra of a form is useful for determining its Waring rank, which can be seen as the problem of decomposing the supersymmetric tensor, associated to the form, minimally as a sum of rank one supersymmetric tensors. In this article we study the apolar algebra of a product of linear forms, which generalizes the case of monomials and connects to the geometry of hyperplane arrangements. In the first part of the article we provide a bound on the Waring rank of a product of linear forms under certain genericity assumptions; for this we use the defining equations of so-called star configurations due to Geramita, Harbourne, and Migliore. In the second part of the article we use the computer algebra system Bertini, which operates by homotopy continuation methods, to solve certain rank equations for catalecticant matrices. Our computations suggest that, up to a change of variables, there are exactly six homogeneous polynomials of degree six in three variables which factor completely as a product of linear forms defining an irreducible multi-arrangement and whose apolar algebras have dimension six in degree three. As a consequence of these calculations, we find six cases of such forms with cactus rank six, five of which also have Waring rank six. Among these are products defining subarrangements of the braid and Hessian arrangements.",2020-02-12T06:25:30Z,2020-02-12T06:25:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04818v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04818v1,"math.AC, math.AG, 13E10, 13N10, 68W30, 14N20, 15A69"
"Tropical Geometry, Quantum Affine Algebras, and Scattering Amplitudes","Nick Early, Jian-Rong Li","The goal of this paper is to make a connection between tropical geometry, representations of quantum affine algebras, and scattering amplitudes in physics. The connection allows us to study important and difficult questions in these areas:   (1) We give a systematic construction of prime modules (including prime non-real modules) of quantum affine algebras using tropical geometry. We also introduce new objects which generalize positive tropical Grassmannians.   (2) We propose a generalization of Grassmannian string integrals in physics, in which the integrand is no longer a finite, but rather an infinite product indexed by prime modules of a quantum affine algebra. We give a general formula of $u$-variables using prime tableaux (corresponding to prime modules of quantum affine algebras of type $A$) and Auslander-Reiten quivers of Grassmannian cluster categories.

Hodge theory in combinatorics,Matthew Baker,"George Birkhoff proved in 1912 that the number of proper colorings of a finite graph G with n colors is a polynomial in n, called the chromatic polynomial of G. Read conjectured in 1968 that for any graph G, the sequence of absolute values of coefficients of the chromatic polynomial is unimodal: it goes up, hits a peak, and then goes down. Read's conjecture was proved by June Huh in a 2012 paper making heavy use of methods from algebraic geometry. Huh's result was subsequently refined and generalized by Huh and Katz, again using substantial doses of algebraic geometry. Both papers in fact establish log-concavity of the coefficients, which is stronger than unimodality.   The breakthroughs of Huh and Huh-Katz left open the more general Rota-Welsh conjecture where graphs are generalized to (not necessarily representable) matroids and the chromatic polynomial of a graph is replaced by the characteristic polynomial of a matroid. The Huh and Huh-Katz techniques are not applicable in this level of generality, since there is no underlying algebraic geometry to which to relate the problem. But in 2015 Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz announced a proof of the Rota-Welsh conjecture based on a novel approach motivated by but not making use of any results from algebraic geometry. The authors first prove that the Rota-Welsh conjecture would follow from combinatorial analogues of the Hard Lefschetz Theorem and Hodge-Riemann relations in algebraic geometry. They then implement an elaborate inductive procedure to prove the combinatorial Hard Lefschetz Theorem and Hodge-Riemann relations using purely combinatorial arguments.   We will survey these developments.",2017-05-22T19:26:19Z,2017-06-01T18:35:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07960v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07960v2,"math.CO, math.AG"
Jacobi and Poisson algebras,"A. L. Agore, G. Militaru","Jacobi/Poisson algebras are algebraic counterparts of Jacobi/Poisson manifolds. We introduce representations of a Jacobi algebra $A$ and Frobenius Jacobi algebras as symmetric objects in the category. A characterization theorem for Frobenius Jacobi algebras is given in terms of integrals on Jacobi algebras. For a vector space $V$ a non-abelian cohomological type object ${\mathcal J}{\mathcal H}^{2} \, (V, \, A)$ is constructed: it classifies all Jacobi algebras containing $A$ as a subalgebra of codimension equal to ${\rm dim} (V)$. Representations of $A$ are used in order to give the decomposition of ${\mathcal J}{\mathcal H}^{2} \, (V, \, A)$ as a coproduct over all Jacobi $A$-module structures on $V$. The bicrossed product $P \bowtie Q$ of two Poisson algebras recently introduced by Ni and Bai appears as a special case of our construction. A new type of deformations of a given Poisson algebra $Q$ is introduced and a cohomological type object $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{A}^{2} \bigl(P,\, Q ~|~ (\triangleleft, \, \triangleright, \, \leftharpoonup, \, \rightharpoonup)\bigl)$ is explicitly constructed as a classifying set for the bicrossed descent problem for extensions of Poisson algebras.

Two problems from the Polishchuk and Positselski book on Quadratic   algebras,"Natalia Iyudu, Stanislav Shkarin","In the book 'Quadratic algebras' by Polishchuk and Positselski [23] algebras with a small number of generators (n=2,3) are considered. For some number r of relations possible Hilbert series are listed, and those appearing as series of Koszul algebras are specified. The first case, where it was not possible to do, namely the case of three generators n=3 and six relations r=6 is formulated as an open problem. We give here a complete answer to this question, namely for quadratic algebras with dim A_1=dim A_2=3, we list all possible Hilbert series, and find out which of them can come from Koszul algebras, and which can not.   As a consequence of this classification, we found an algebra, which serves as a counterexample to another problem from the same book [23] (Chapter 7, Sec. 1, Conjecture 2), saying that Koszul algebra of finite global homological dimension d has dim A_1 >= d. Namely, the 3-generated algebra A given by relations xx+yx=xz=zy=0 is Koszul and its Koszul dual algebra A^! has Hilbert series of degree 4: H_{A^!}(t)= 1+3t+3t^2+2t^3+t^4, hence A has global homological dimension 4.",2016-06-28T16:47:48Z,2016-06-28T16:47:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00336v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00336v1,"math.RA, math.AC, math.CO, 16A22, 16S37, 14A22"
Efficient computation of a semi-algebraic basis of the first homology   group of a semi-algebraic set,"Saugata Basu, Sarah Percival","Let $\mathrm{R}$ be a real closed field and $\mathrm{C}$ the algebraic closure of $\mathrm{R}$. We give an algorithm for computing a semi-algebraic basis for the first homology group, $\mathrm{H}_1(S,\mathbb{F})$, with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{F}$, of any given semi-algebraic set $S \subset \mathrm{R}^k$ defined by a closed formula. The complexity of the algorithm is bounded singly exponentially. It is not known how to compute such a basis for the higher homology groups with singly exponential complexity.   As an intermediate step in our algorithm we construct a semi-algebraic subset $\Gamma$ of the given semi-algebraic set $S$, such that $\mathrm{H}_q(S,\Gamma) = 0$ for $q=0,1$. We relate this construction to a basic theorem in complex algebraic geometry stating that for any affine variety $X$ of dimension $n$, there exists Zariski closed subsets \[ Z^{(n-1)} \supset \cdots \supset Z^{(1)} \supset Z^{(0)} \] with $\dim_{\mathrm{C}} Z^{(i)} \leq i$, and $\mathrm{H}_q(X,Z^{(i)}) = 0$ for $0 \leq q \leq i$. We conjecture a quantitative version of this result in the semi-algebraic category, with $X$ and $Z^{(i)}$ replaced by closed semi-algebraic sets. We make initial progress on this conjecture by proving the existence of $Z^{(0)}$ and $Z^{(1)}$ with complexity bounded singly exponentially (previously, such an algorithm was known only for constructing $Z_0$).",2021-07-19T15:00:18Z,2021-07-19T15:00:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08947v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08947v1,"math.AG, math.AT, 14F25, W6830"
"The Jacobian map, the Jacobian group and the group of automorphisms of   the Grassmann algebra",V. V. Bavula,"There are nontrivial dualities and parallels between polynomial algebras and the Grassmann algebras. This paper is an attempt to look at the Grassmann algebras at the angle of the Jacobian conjecture for polynomial algebras (which is the question/conjecture about the $ $ {\em Jacobian set} -- the set of all algebra endomorphisms of a polynomial algebra with the Jacobian 1 -- the Jacobian conjecture claims that the Jacobian set is a {\em group}). In this paper, we study in detail the Jacobian set for the Grassmann algebra which turns out to be a {\em group} -- the {\em Jacobian group} $\Sigma$ -- a sophisticated (and large) part of the group of automorphisms of the Grassmann algebra $\L_n$. It is proved that the Jacobian group $\Sigma$ is a rational unipotent algebraic group. A (minimal) set of generators for the algebraic group $\Sigma$, its dimension and coordinates are found explicitly. In particular, for $n\geq 4$,   \dim (\S) = (n-1)2^{n-1} -n^2+2 if $n$ is even, (n-1)2^{n-1} -n^2+1 if $n$ is odd.   The same is done for the Jacobian ascents - some natural algebraic overgroups of $\Sigma$. It is proved that the Jacobian map $\s \mapsto \det (\frac{\der \s (x_i)}{\der x_j})$ is surjective for odd $n$, and is {\em not} for even $n$ though, in this case, the image of the Jacobian map is an algebraic subvariety of codimension 1 given by a single equation.",2007-03-12T17:12:46Z,2007-03-12T17:12:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703352v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0703352v1,"math.RA, math.AG, 14L17, 14R10, 14R15, 14M20"

The resulting object, which we call a formal (affine) Demazure algebra, is parameterized by a one-dimensional commutative formal group law and has the following important property: specialization to the additive and multiplicative periodic formal group laws yields completions of the nil Hecke and the 0-Hecke rings respectively. We also introduce a deformed version of the formal (affine) Demazure algebra, which we call a formal (affine) Hecke algebra. We show that the specialization of the formal (affine) Hecke algebra to the additive and multiplicative periodic formal group laws gives completions of the degenerate (affine) Hecke algebra and the usual (affine) Hecke algebra respectively.

From the Virasoro Algebra to Krichever--Novikov Type Algebras and Beyond,Martin Schlichenmaier,"Starting from the Virasoro algebra and its relatives the generalization to higher genus compact Riemann surfaces was initiated by Krichever and Novikov. The elements of these algebras are meromorphic objects which are holomorphic outside a finite set of points. A crucial and non-trivial point is to establish an almost-grading replacing the honest grading in the Virasoro case. Such an almost-grading is given by splitting the set of points of possible poles into two non-empty disjoint subsets. Krichever and Novikov considered the two-point case. Schlichenmaier studied the most general multi-point situation with arbitrary splittings. Here we will review the path of developments from the Virasoro algebra to its higher genus and multi-point analogs. The starting point will be a Poisson algebra structure on the space of meromorphic forms of all weights. As sub-structures the vector field algebras, function algebras, Lie superalgebras and the related current algebras show up. All these algebras will be almost-graded. In detail almost-graded central extensions are classified. In particular, for the vector field algebra it is essentially unique. The defining cocycle are given in geometric terms. Some applications, including the semi-infinite wedge form representations are recalled. Finally, some remarks on the by Krichever and Sheinman recently introduced Lax operator algebras are made.",2013-01-31T19:42:12Z,2013-01-31T19:42:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7725v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.7725v1,"math.AG, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, math.QA, math.RA, Primary: 17B56, Secondary: 17B68, 17B65, 17B66, 30F30, 81R10, 81T40"
Resolution of Stringy Singularities by Non-commutative Algebras,"David Berenstein, Robert G. Leigh","In this paper we propose a unified approach to (topological) string theory on certain singular spaces in their large volume limit. The approach exploits the non-commutative structure of D-branes, so the space is described by an algebraic geometry of non-commutative rings. The paper is devoted to the study of examples of these algebras. In our study there is an auxiliary commutative algebraic geometry of the center of the (local) algebras which plays an important role as the target space geometry where closed strings propagate. The singularities that are resolved will be the singularities of this auxiliary geometry. The singularities are resolved by the non-commutative algebra if the local non-commutative rings are regular. This definition guarantees that D-branes have a well defined K-theory class. Homological functors also play an important role. They describe the intersection theory of D-branes and lead to a formal definition of local quivers at singularities, which can be computed explicitly for many types of singularities. These results can be interpreted in terms of the derived category of coherent sheaves over the non-commutative rings, giving a non-commutative version of recent work by M. Douglas. We also describe global features like the Betti numbers of compact singular Calabi-Yau threefolds via global holomorphic sections of cyclic homology classes.",2001-05-22T20:41:10Z,2001-05-25T04:17:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0105229v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0105229v2,"hep-th, math.AG"
L-infinity algebras from multisymplectic geometry,Christopher L.

In our previous work with Baez and Hoffnung, we described how the `higher analogs' of the algebraic and geometric structures found in symplectic geometry should naturally arise in 2-plectic geometry. In particular, we showed that just as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, any 2-plectic manifold gives a Lie 2-algebra of 1-forms and functions. Lie n-algebras are examples of L-infinity algebras: graded vector spaces which are equipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a generalized Jacobi identity. Here, we generalize our previous result. Given an n-plectic manifold, we explicitly construct a corresponding Lie n-algebra on a complex consisting of differential forms whose multi-brackets are specified by the n-plectic structure. We also show that any n-plectic manifold gives rise to another kind of algebraic structure known as a differential graded Leibniz algebra.

Arithmetic of Calabi-Yau Varieties and Rational Conformal Field Theory,Rolf Schimmrigk,It is proposed that certain techniques from arithmetic algebraic geometry provide a framework which is useful to formulate a direct and intrinsic link between the geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds and the underlying conformal field theory.

Pluecker-type relations for orthogonal planes,"José Figueroa-O'Farrill, George Papadopoulos",We explore a Pluecker-type relation which occurs naturally in the study of maximally supersymmetric solutions of certain supergravity theories.

In low dimension we present evidence for a geometric characterisation of the relation in terms of middle-dimensional orthogonal planes in euclidean or lorentzian inner product spaces.,2002-11-11T17:16:29Z,2003-04-29T11:29:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0211170v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0211170v2,"math.AG, hep-th, math.DG"

The derived contraction algebra,Matt Booth,"Using Braun-Chuang-Lazarev's derived quotient, we enhance the contraction algebra of Donovan-Wemyss to an invariant valued in differential graded algebras. Given an isolated contraction $X \to X_\mathrm{con}$ of an irreducible rational curve $C$ to a point $p$, we show that its derived contraction algebra controls the derived noncommutative deformations of $C$. We use dg singularity categories to prove that, when $X$ is smooth, the derived contraction algebra recovers the geometry of $X_\mathrm{con}$ complete locally around $p$, establishing a positive answer to a derived version of a conjecture of Donovan and Wemyss. When $X \to X_\mathrm{con}$ is a simple threefold flopping contraction, it is known that the Bridgeland-Chen flop-flop autoequivalence of $D^b(X)$ is a `noncommutative twist' around the contraction algebra. We show that the derived contraction algebra controls an analogous autoequivalence in more general settings, and in particular for partial resolutions of Kleinian singularities.",2019-03-28T17:42:32Z,2019-06-14T19:02:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12156v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12156v2,math.AG
On the noncommutative Poisson geometry of certain wild character   varieties,"Maxime Fairon, David Fernández","To show that certain wild character varieties are multiplicative analogues of quiver varieties, Boalch introduced colored multiplicative quiver varieties. They form a class of (nondegenerate) Poisson varieties attached to colored quivers whose representation theory is controlled by fission algebras: noncommutative algebras generalizing the multiplicative preprojective algebras of Crawley-Boevey and Shaw. Previously, Van den Bergh exploited the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle to prove that the natural Poisson structure of any (non-colored) multiplicative quiver variety is induced by an $H_0$-Poisson structure on the underlying multiplicative preprojective algebra; indeed, it turns out that this noncommutative structure comes from a Hamiltonian double quasi-Poisson algebra constructed from the quiver itself. In this article we conjecture that, via the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, the natural Poisson structure on each colored multiplicative quiver variety is induced by an $H_0$-Poisson structure on the underlying fission algebra which, in turn, is obtained from a Hamiltonian double quasi-Poisson algebra attached to the colored quiver. We study some consequences of this conjecture and we prove it in two significant cases: the interval and the triangle.",2021-03-18T09:44:21Z,2021-11-06T18:48:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10117v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10117v3,"math.RT, math.QA, math.SG"

The topological Hopf algebroid structure of this convolution algebra is here clarified, by providing an explicit description of its topological antipode as well as of its other structure maps. Conditions under which that homomorphism becomes an homeomorphism are also discussed. These results, in particular, apply to the smooth global sections of any Lie algebroid over a smooth (connected) manifold and they lead a new formal groupoid scheme to enter into the picture. In the Appendix we develop the necessary machinery behind complete Hopf algebroid constructions, which involves also the topological tensor product of filtered bimodules over filtered rings.",2017-05-18T17:13:51Z,2018-02-15T12:18:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06698v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06698v2,"math.AC, math.AG, math.AT, math.DG, math.RA, 13J10, 20L05, 13N10, 16W70 (Primary), 46M05, 16W50, 16T15, 22A22

"Superfiltered $A_\infty$-deformations of the exterior algebra, and local   mirror symmetry",Jack Smith,"The exterior algebra $E$ on a finite-rank free module $V$ carries a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading and an increasing filtration, and the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded filtered deformations of $E$ as an associative algebra are the familiar Clifford algebras, classified by quadratic forms on $V$. We extend this result to $A_\infty$-algebra deformations $\mathcal{A}$, showing that they are classified by formal functions on $V$. The proof translates the problem into the language of matrix factorisations, using the localised mirror functor construction of Cho-Hong-Lau, and works over an arbitrary ground ring. We also compute the Hochschild cohomology algebras of such $\mathcal{A}$.   By applying these ideas to a related construction of Cho-Hong-Lau we prove a local form of homological mirror symmetry: the Floer $A_\infty$-algebra of a monotone Lagrangian torus is quasi-isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of the expected matrix factorisation of its superpotential.",2019-10-02T17:22:49Z,2021-10-09T15:15:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01096v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01096v3,"math.SG, math.AG, math.QA, 18G55, 14F05, 53D37, 14J33, 16E40"

Given a dg manifold, we prove that a `formal exponential map' exists if and only if the Atiyah class vanishes. Inspired by Kapranov's construction of a homotopy Lie algebra associated with the holomorphic tangent bundle of a complex manifold, we prove that the space of vector fields on a dg manifold admits an $L_\infty[1]$ algebra structure, unique up to isomorphism, whose unary bracket is the Lie derivative w.r.t. the homological vector field, whose binary bracket is a 1-cocycle representative of the Atiyah class, and whose higher multibrackets can be computed by a recursive formula. For the dg manifold $(T_X^{0,1}[1],\bar{\partial})$ arising from a complex manifold $X$, we prove that this $L_\infty[1]$ algebra structure is quasi-isomorphic to the standard $L_\infty[1]$ algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex $\Omega^{0,\bullet}(T^{1,0}_X)$.",2021-06-01T21:35:18Z,2021-11-19T05:10:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00812v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00812v3,"math.DG, math.AG, math.QA"
Sequence-regular commutative DG-rings,Liran Shaul,"We introduce a new class of commutative noetherian DG-rings which generalizes the class of regular local rings. These are defined to be local DG-rings $(A,\bar{\mathfrak{m}})$ such that the maximal ideal $\bar{\mathfrak{m}} \subseteq \mathrm{H}^0(A)$ can be generated by an $A$-regular sequence. We call these DG-rings sequence-regular DG-rings, and make a detailed study of them. Using methods of Cohen-Macaulay differential graded algebra, we prove that the Auslander-Buchsbaum-Serre theorem about localization generalizes to this setting. This allows us to define global sequence-regular DG-rings, and to introduce this regularity condition to derived algebraic geometry. It is shown that these DG-rings share many properties of classical regular local rings, and in particular we are able to construct canonical residue DG-fields in this context. Finally, we show that sequence-regular DG-rings are ubiquitous, and in particular, any eventually coconnective derived algebraic variety over a perfect field is generically sequence-regular.",2021-06-15T12:55:38Z,2024-02-27T15:17:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08109v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08109v2,"math.AC, math.AG, math.AT, 16E45, 13D09, 13H05, 13H10"
A Geometrical Interpretation of Okubo Spin Group,"Daniele Corradetti, Francesco Zucconi","In this work we define, for the first time, the affine and projective plane over the real Okubo algebra, showing a concrete geometrical interpretation of its Spin group. Okubo algebra is a flexible, composition algebra which is also a not unital division algebra. Even though Okubo algebra has been known for more than 40 years, we believe that this is the first time the algebra was used for affine and projective geometry. After showing that all axioms of affine geometry are verified, we define a projective plane over Okubo algebra as completion of the affine plane and directly through the use of Veronese coordinates. We then present a bijection between the two constructions.

Then we prove a general partial algebraization result in non-archimedean geometry. The result says that we can always algebraize a geometrically reduced affinoid rigid-analytic space in ""one direction"" in an appropriate sense. As an application of this result, we show the remaining cases of the Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing for affinoid algebras, which were previously conjectured in [BM21, {\S}7]. This allows us to deduce a stronger version of the rigid-analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing Conjecture (see [Han20, Conj. 1.2]) over a field of characteristic 0.

Quantization of Holomorphic Symplectic Manifolds: Analytic Continuation   of Path Integrals and Coherent States,Joshua Lackman,"We extend Berezin's quantization $q:M\to\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ to holomorphic symplectic manifolds, which involves replacing the state space $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ with its complexification $\text{T}^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}.$ We show that this is equivalent to replacing rank$\unicode{x2013}$1 Hermitian projections with all rank$\unicode{x2013}$1 projections. We furthermore allow the states to be points in the cotangent bundle of a Grassmanian. We also define a holomorphic path integral quantization as a certain idempotent in a convolution algebra and we prove that these two quantizations are equivalent. For each $n>0,$ we construct a faithful functor from the category of finite dimensional $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebras to to the category of hyperk\""{a}hler manifolds and we show that our quantization recovers the original $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebra.

Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined   algebraic domains,Naoki Kitazawa,"Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves.

Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.   We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer.

Classification of digital affine noncommutative geometries,"Shahn Majid, Anna Pachol","It is known that connected translation invariant $n$-dimensional noncommutative differentials $d x^i$ on the algebra $k[x^1,\cdots,x^n]$ of polynomials in $n$-variables over a field $k$ are classified by commutative algebras $V$ on the vector space spanned by the coordinates. This data also applies to construct differentials on the Heisenberg algebra `spacetime' with relations $[x^\mu,x^\nu]=\lambda\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ where $ \Theta$ is an antisymmetric matrix as well as to Lie algebras with pre-Lie algebra structures. We specialise the general theory to the field $k={\ \mathbb{F}}_2$ of two elements, in which case translation invariant metrics (i.e. with constant coefficients) are equivalent to making $V$ a Frobenius algebras. We classify all of these and their quantum Levi-Civita bimodule connections for $n=2,3$, with partial results for $n=4$. For $n=2$ we find 3 inequivalent differential structures admitting 1,2 and 3 invariant metrics respectively. For $n=3$ we find 6 differential structures admitting $0,1,2,3,4,7$ invariant metrics respectively. We give some examples for $n=4$ and general $n$. Surprisingly, not all our geometries for $n\ge 2$ have zero quantum Riemann curvature. Quantum gravity is normally seen as a weighted `sum' over all possible metrics but our results are a step towards a deeper approach in which we must also `sum' over differential structures. Over ${\mathbb{F}}_2$ we construct some of our algebras and associated structures by digital gates, opening up the possibility of `digital geometry'.",2017-01-22T20:53:44Z,2017-01-22T20:53:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06919v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06919v1,"math.DG, gr-qc, math-ph, math.MP, math.QA"

In particular, a solution of an algebraic equation in a left-symmetric algebra which is an analogue of classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Lie algebra can induce a phase space. In this paper, we find that such phase spaces have a symplectically isomorphic property. We also give all such phase spaces in dimension 4 and some examples in dimension 6.

In combining this with an observation of Anderson on the contracting property of p^{-e}-linear operators we obtain an elementary approach to test ideals in the case of affine k-algebras, where k is an F-finite field.

The application to invariant theory is based on the construction of suitable signature maps associated to a group acting linearly on the respective curves. We consider two versions of this construction: differential and joint signature maps. In our examples and computational experiments, we focus on the complex Euclidean group, and introduce an algebraic joint signature that we prove determines equivalences of curves under this action and the size of a curve's symmetry group.

Measured asymptotic expanders and rigidity for Roe algebras,"Kang Li, Ján Špakula, Jiawen Zhang","Our main result about rigidity of Roe algebras is the following: if $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces with bounded geometry such that their Roe algebras are $*$-isomorphic, then $X$ and $Y$ are coarsely equivalent provided that either $X$ or $Y$ contains no sparse subspaces consisting of ghostly measured asymptotic expanders. Note that this geometric condition generalises the existing technical assumptions used for rigidity of Roe algebras.   Consequently, we show that the rigidity holds for all bounded geometry spaces which coarsely embed into some $L^p$-space for $p\in [1,\infty)$. Moreover, we also verify the rigidity for the box spaces constructed by Arzhantseva-Tessera and Delabie-Khukhro even though they do \emph{not} coarsely embed into any $L^p$-space.   The key step towards our proof for the rigidity is to show that a block-rank-one (ghost) projection on a sparse space $X$ belongs to the Roe algebra $C^*(X)$ if and only if $X$ consists of (ghostly) measured asymptotic expanders. As a by-product, we also deduce that ghostly measured asymptotic expanders are new sources of counterexamples to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.",2020-10-21T03:59:46Z,2022-12-20T07:32:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10749v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10749v3,"math.OA, math.MG, 46H35, 20F65, 05C81"

Solving the Gibbs Problem with Algebraic Projective Geometry,"Michela Mancini, John A. Christian","Orbit determination (OD) from three position vectors is one of the classical problems in astrodynamics. Early contributions to this problem were made by J. Willard Gibbs in the late 1800s and OD of this type is known today as ``Gibbs Problem''. There are a variety of popular solutions to the Gibbs problem. While some authors solve for the orbital elements directly, most contemporary discussions are based on a vector analysis approach inspired by Gibbs himself.   This work presents a completely different solution to those just described. Although there is nothing wrong with the vector analysis approach, some interesting insights may be gained by considering the problem from the perspective of algebraic projective geometry. Such an algebraic solution is presented here. The OD procedure is based upon a novel and geometrically meaningful solution to the algebraic fitting of an ellipse with a focus at the origin using only three points. Although the final OD result is identical to the classical vector analysis approach pioneered by Gibbs, this new algebraic solution is interesting in its own right.",2024-03-13T18:28:22Z,2024-03-13T18:28:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08893v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08893v1,math.AG

Birational geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves and Bridgeland stability,Jack Huizenga,"Moduli spaces of sheaves and Hilbert schemes of points have experienced a recent resurgence in interest in the past several years, due largely to new techniques arising from Bridgeland stability conditions and derived category methods. In particular, classical questions about the birational geometry of these spaces can be answered by using new tools such as the positivity lemma of Bayer and Macr\`i. In this article we first survey classical results on moduli spaces of sheaves and their birational geometry. We then discuss the relationship between these classical results and the new techniques coming from Bridgeland stability, and discuss how cones of ample divisors on these spaces can be computed with these new methods.

The Geometry of Rank Drop in a Class of Face-Splitting Matrix Products,"Erin Connelly, Sameer Agarwal, Alperen Ergur, Rekha R. Thomas","Given $k \leq 6$ points $(x_i,y_i) \in \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2$, we characterize rank deficiency of the $k \times 9$ matrix $Z_k$ with rows $x_i^\top \otimes y_i^\top$ in terms of the geometry of the point configurations $\{x_i\}$ and $\{y_i\}$. While this question comes from computer vision the answer relies on tools from classical algebraic geometry: For $k \leq 5$, the geometry of the rank-drop locus is characterized by cross-ratios and basic (projective) geometry of point configurations. For the case $k=6$ the rank-drop locus is captured by the classical theory of cubic surfaces.",2023-01-24T05:38:25Z,2024-03-18T22:57:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09826v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09826v2,"math.AG, math.AC, math.CO"
Geometric interpretation of valuated term (pre)orders,"Netanel Friedenberg, Kalina Mincheva","Valuated term orders are studied for the purposes of Gr\""{o}bner theory over fields with valuation. The points of a usual tropical variety correspond to certain valuated terms preorders. Generalizing both of these, the set of all ``well-behaved'' valuated term preorders is canonically in bijection with the points of a space introduced in our previous work on tropical adic geometry. In this paper we interpret these points geometrically by explicitly characterizing them in terms of classical polyhedral geometry. This characterization gives a bijection with equivalence classes of flags of polyhedra as well as a bijection with a class of prime filters on a lattice of polyhedral sets. The first of these also classifies valuated term orders. The second bijection is of the same flavor as the bijections from [van der Put and Schneider, 1995] in non-archimedean analytic geometry and indicates that the results of that paper may have analogues in tropical adic geometry.",2023-06-08T20:20:39Z,2023-06-08T20:20:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05538v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05538v1,"math.AG, math.AC, math.MG, math.RA, 14T99 (Primary), 14T10, 14T15, 14T20, 15A80, 52B20, 16Y60

Sugawara Construction for Higher Genus Riemann Surfaces,Martin Schlichenmaier,"By the classical genus zero Sugawara construction one obtains from admissible representations of affine Lie algebras (Kac-Moody algebras of affine type) representations of the Virasoro algebra. In this lecture first the classical construction is recalled. Then, after giving a review on the global multi-point algebras of Krichever-Novikov type for compact Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus, the higher genus Sugawara construction is introduced. Finally, the lecture reports on results obtained in joint work with O.K. Sheinman. We were able to show that also in the higher genus, multi-point situation one obtains from representations of the global algebras of affine type representations of a centrally extended algebra of meromorphic vector fields on Riemann surfaces. The latter algebra is the generalization of the Virasoro algebra to higher genus.

Here the term graded is applied to non-negatively graded algebras $A$ with $A_0$ reduced and finite dimensional. Thus the trivial grading $A=A_0$ is only allowed if $A$ is a product of finite field extensions of $k$. It has been conjectured (G. Corti\~nas, S. Geller, C. Weibel; The Artinian Berger Conjecture.

The algebra of discrete torsion,Ralph M. Kaufmann,"We analyze the algebraic structures of G--Frobenius algebras which are the algebras associated to global group quotient objects. Here G is any finite group. These algebras turn out to be modules over the Drinfeld double of the group ring k[G]. We furthermore prove that discrete torsion is a universal group action of H^2(G,k^*) on G--Frobenius algebras by isomorphisms of the underlying linear structure. These morphisms are realized explicitly by taking the tensor product with twisted group rings. This gives an algebraic realization of discrete torsion and allows for a treatment analogous to the theory of projective representations of groups, group extensions and twisted group ring modules. Lastly, we identify another set of discrete universal transformations among G--Frobenius algebras pertaining to their super--structure and classified by Hom(G,Z/2Z).",2002-08-09T19:29:41Z,2002-08-10T09:17:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0208081v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0208081v2,"math.AG, hep-th, math.QA"

One of the main points of this deformation method is that the deformed algebra comes endowed with a canonical twisted Jacobi identity. We show in the present paper that when our deformation scheme is applied to $\sll$ we can, by choosing parameters suitably, deform $\sll$ into the Heisenberg Lie algebra and some other three-dimensional Lie algebras in addition to more exotic types of algebras, this being in stark contrast to the classical deformation schemes where $\sll$ is rigid.

On the Hopf Algebraic Structure of Lie Group Integrators,"H. Z. Munthe-Kaas, W. M. Wright","A commutative but not cocommutative graded Hopf algebra $\Hn$, based on ordered rooted trees, is studied. This Hopf algebra generalizes the Hopf algebraic structure of unordered rooted trees $\Hc$, developed by Butcher in his study of Runge--Kutta methods and later rediscovered by Connes and Moscovici in the context of non-commutative geometry and by Kreimer where it is used to describe renormalization in quantum field theory. It is shown that $\Hn$ is naturally obtained from a universal object in a category of non-commutative derivations, and in particular, it forms a foundation for the study of numerical integrators based on non-commutative Lie group actions on a manifold. Recursive and non-recursive definitions of the coproduct and the antipode are derived. It is also shown that the dual of $\Hn$ is a Hopf algebra of Grossman and Larson. $\Hn$ contains two well-known Hopf algebras as special cases: The Hopf algebra $\Hc$ of Butcher--Connes--Kreimer is identified as a proper subalgebra of $\Hn$ using the image of a tree symmetrization operator.

Holonomy groups and special geometric structures of pseudo-Kählerian   manifolds of index 2,Anton S.

The classification of Riemannian holonomy algebras is a classical result. The classification of Lorentzian holonomy algebras was obtained recently.   In the present paper weakly-irreducible not irreducible subalgebras of $\su(1,n+1)$ ($n\geq 0$) are classified. Weakly-irreducible not irreducible holonomy algebras of pseudo-K\""ahlerian and special pseudo-K\""ahlerian manifolds are classified. An example of metric for each possible holonomy algebra is given. This gives the classification of holonomy algebras for pseudo-K\""ahlerian manifolds of index 2.   Finally we consider some examples and applications. We describe examples of 4-dimensional Lie groups with left-invariant pseudo-K\""ahlerian metrics and determine their holonomy algebras. We use our classification of holonomy algebras to give a new proof for the classification of simply connected pseudo-K\""ahlerian symmetric spaces of index 2 with weakly-irreducible not irreducible holonomy algebras. We consider time-like cones over Lorentzian Sasaki manifolds. These cones are also pseudo-K\""ahlerian manifolds of index 2.

The first of them is the naturally graded none Lie filiform Leibniz algebras and the another one is the naturally graded filiform Lie algebras. Here we do consider Leibniz algebras appearing from the naturally graded none Lie filiform Leibniz algebras. This class can be splited into two subclasses. However, isomorphisms within each class there were not investigated. Before U.D.Bekbaev and I.S.Rakhimov suggested an approach to the isomorphism problem in terms of invariants.

Hopf algebras of primitive Lie pseudogroups and Hopf cyclic cohomology,"Henri Moscovici, Bahram Rangipour","We associate to each infinite primitive Lie pseudogroup a Hopf algebra of `transverse symmetries', by refining a procedure due to Connes and the first author in the case of the general pseudogroup. The affiliated Hopf algebra can be viewed as a `quantum group' counterpart of the infinite-dimensional primitive Lie algebra of the pseudogroup. It is first constructed via its action on the \'etale groupoid associated to the pseudogroup, and then realized as a bicrossed product of a universal enveloping algebra by a Hopf algebra of regular functions on a formal group. The bicrossed product structure allows to express its Hopf cyclic cohomology in terms of a bicocyclic bicomplex analogous to the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. As an application, we compute the relative Hopf cyclic cohomology modulo the linear isotropy for the Hopf algebra of the general pseudogroup, and find explicit cocycle representatives for the universal Chern classes in Hopf cyclic cohomology. As another application, we determine all Hopf cyclic cohomology groups for the Hopf algebra associated to the pseudogroup of local diffeomorphisms of the line.",2008-03-10T18:32:40Z,2008-03-10T18:32:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1320v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.1320v1,"math.QA, math.DG, math.KT, math.OA, 58B34, 81R10, 81R15, 81R60"
"Categorified central extensions, étale Lie 2-groups and Lie's Third   Theorem for locally exponential Lie algebras",Christoph Wockel,"Lie's Third Theorem, asserting that each finite-dimensional Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group, fails in infinite dimensions. The modern account on this phenomenon is the integration problem for central extensions of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, which in turn is phrased in terms of an integration procedure for Lie algebra cocycles.   This paper remedies the obstructions for integrating cocycles and central extensions from Lie algebras to Lie groups by generalising the integrating objects. Those objects obey the maximal coherence that one can expect. Moreover, we show that they are the universal ones for the integration problem.   The main application of this result is that a Mackey-complete locally exponential Lie algebra (e.g., a Banach-Lie algebra) integrates to a Lie 2-group in the sense that there is a natural Lie functor from certain Lie 2-groups to Lie algebras, sending the integrating Lie 2-group to an isomorphic Lie algebra.",2008-12-09T12:02:50Z,2011-07-01T10:57:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1673v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1673v3,"math.GR, math.CT, math.DG, 22E65, 58H05, 55N20"

The gl_{N+1} Gaudin model assigns to each multiplicity space of that decomposition a commutative (Bethe) algebra of linear operators acting on the multiplicity space. The Bethe ansatz method is a method to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Bethe algebra. One starts with a critical point of a suitable (master) function and constructs an eigenvector of the Bethe algebra.   In this paper we consider the algebra of functions on the critical set of the associated master function and show that the action of this algebra on itself is isomorphic to the action of the Bethe algebra on a suitable subspace of the multiplicity space.

To achieve this we generalise the dimer model construction of noncommutative crepant resolutions of toric algebras in dimension three by associating a superpotential and a notion of consistency to toric algebras of arbitrary dimension. For consistent algebras $A$, the coherent component of the fine moduli space of $A$-modules is constructed explicitly by GIT and provides a partial resolution of $\Spec Z(A)$. For abelian skew group algebras and algebraically consistent dimer model algebras, we introduce a cell complex $\Delta$ in a real torus whose cells describe uniformly all maps in the minimal projective bimodule resolution of $A$. We illustrate the general construction of $\Delta$ for an example in dimension four arising from a tilting bundle on a smooth toric Fano threefold to highlight the importance of the incidence function on $\Delta$.",2010-08-09T11:05:40Z,2011-12-14T08:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1485v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1485v3,"math.AG, hep-th, math.RA"

Exploring of morphisms of the representation leads to the concepts of generating set and basis of representation.

On complex H-type Lie algebras,Nathaniel Eldredge,"H-type Lie algebras were introduced by Kaplan as a class of real Lie algebras generalizing the familiar Heisenberg Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}^3$. The H-type property depends on a choice of inner product on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Among the H-type Lie algebras are the complex Heisenberg Lie algebras $\mathfrak{h}^{2n+1}_{\mathbb{C}}$, for which the standard Euclidean inner product not only satisfies the H-type condition, but is also compatible with the complex structure, in that it is Hermitian. We show that, up to isometric isomorphism, these are the only complex Lie algebras with an inner product satisfying both conditions. In other words, the family $\mathfrak{h}^{2n+1}_{\mathbb{C}}$ comprises all of the complex H-type Lie algebras.",2014-06-10T00:56:34Z,2016-10-14T17:35:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2396v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2396v3,"math.RA, math.DG, 17B30, 22E30, 22E25, 32M05, 32Q99"
Regular subalgebras and nilpotent orbits of real graded Lie algebras,"H. Dietrich, Paolo Faccin, Willem A. de Graaf","For a semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers, Dynkin (1952) developed an algorithm to classify the regular semisimple subalgebras, up to conjugacy by the inner automorphism group. For a graded semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers, Vinberg (1979) showed that a classification of a certain type of regular subalgebras (called carrier algebras) yields a classification of the nilpotent orbits in a homogeneous component of that Lie algebra. Here we consider these problems for (graded) semisimple Lie algebras over the real numbers. First, we describe an algorithm to classify the regular semisimple subalgebras of a real semisimple Lie algebra. This also yields an algorithm for listing, up to conjugacy, the carrier algebras in a real graded semisimple real algebra. We then discuss what needs to be done to obtain a classification of the nilpotent orbits from that; such classifications have applications in differential geometry and theoretical physics. Our algorithms are implemented in the language of the computer algebra system GAP, using our package CoReLG; we report on example computations.",2014-07-29T19:58:47Z,2014-07-29T19:58:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7850v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7850v1,"math.RT, 20G20"
"Rank $n$ swapping algebra for the $\operatorname{PSL}(n, \mathbb{R})$   Hitchin component",Zhe Sun,"F. Labourie [arXiv:1212.5015] characterized the Hitchin components for $\operatorname{PSL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ for any $n>1$ by using the swapping algebra, where the swapping algebra should be understood as a ring equipped with a Poisson bracket. We introduce the rank $n$ swapping algebra, which is the quotient of the swapping algebra by the $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ determinant relations. The main results are the well-definedness of the rank $n$ swapping algebra and the ""cross-ratio"" in its fraction algebra. As a consequence, we use the sub fraction algebra of the rank $n$ swapping algebra generated by these ""cross-ratios"" to characterize the $\operatorname{PSL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ Hitchin component for a fixed $n>1$.

Quantum Algebras and Cyclic Quiver Varieties,Andrei Neguţ,"The purpose of this thesis is to present certain viewpoints on the geometric representation theory of Nakajima cyclic quiver varieties, in relation to the Maulik-Okounkov stable basis. Our main technical tool is the shuffle algebra, which arises as the K-theoretic Hall algebra of the double cyclic quiver. We prove the isomorphism between the shuffle algebra and the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,t}(sl_n^^), and identify the quotients of Verma modules for the shuffle algebra with the K-theory groups of Nakajima cyclic quiver varieties, which were studied by Nakajima and Varagnolo-Vasserot.   The shuffle algebra viewpoint allows us to construct the universal R-matrix of the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,t}(sl_n^^), and to factor it in terms of pieces that arise from subalgebras isomorphic to quantum affine groups U_{q}(gl_m^), for various m. This factorization generalizes constructions of Khoroshkin-Tolstoy to the toroidal case, and matches the factorization that Maulik-Okounkov produce via the stable basis in the K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties. We connect the two pictures by computing formulas for the root generators of U_{q,t}(sl_n^^) acting on the stable basis, which provide a wide extension of Murnaghan-Nakayama and Pieri type rules from combinatorics.",2015-04-24T14:33:58Z,2015-05-19T01:46:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06525v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06525v2,"math.RT, math.AG, math.CO, math.QA"

Using this more general point of view, useful structural insights and an easier access to calculations can be obtained. The concept of almost-grading will yield information about triangular decompositions which are of importance in the theory of representations.

We prove the alternative that depending on bi-dimensions of the algebra, the Lie algebra structure makes it either always of infinite type or generically rigid, and we specify the bi-dimensions for each of the choices. Explicit criteria for rigidity of pseudo $H$- and $J$-type algebras are given. In particular, we establish the relation of the so-called $J^2$-condition to rigidity, and we explore these conditions in relation to pseudo $H$-type algebras.",2016-03-01T17:35:36Z,2017-05-21T21:31:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00373v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00373v2,"math.RT, math.DG, 17B30, 17B70, 16W55, 22E60"

In the context of algebras we also study the relation of amenability with proper infiniteness.

Drinfeld Orbifold Algebras for Symmetric Groups,"Briana Foster-Greenwood, Cathy Kriloff","Drinfeld orbifold algebras are a type of deformation of skew group algebras generalizing graded Hecke algebras of interest in representation theory, algebraic combinatorics, and noncommutative geometry. In this article, we classify all Drinfeld orbifold algebras for symmetric groups acting by the natural permutation representation. This provides, for nonabelian groups, infinite families of examples of Drinfeld orbifold algebras that are not graded Hecke algebras. We include explicit descriptions of the maps recording commutator relations and show there is a one-parameter family of such maps supported only on the identity and a three-parameter family of maps supported only on 3-cycles and 5-cycles. Each commutator map must satisfy properties arising from a Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt condition on the algebra, and our analysis of the properties illustrates reduction techniques using orbits of group element factorizations and intersections of fixed point spaces.",2016-11-01T22:21:07Z,2016-11-01T22:21:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00410v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00410v1,"math.RA, math.CO, 16S80 (Primary) 16E40, 16S35, 20B30 (Secondary)"
"Line defect Schur indices, Verlinde algebras and $U(1)_r$ fixed points","Andrew Neitzke, Fei Yan","Given an $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory, we reconsider the Schur index $\mathcal{I}_L(q)$ in the presence of a half line defect $L$. Recently Cordova-Gaiotto-Shao found that $\mathcal{I}_L(q)$ admits an expansion in terms of characters of the chiral algebra $\mathcal{A}$ introduced by Beem et al., with simple coefficients $v_{L,\beta}(q)$. We report a puzzling new feature of this expansion: the $q \to 1$ limit of the coefficients $v_{L_,\beta}(q)$ is linearly related to the vacuum expectation values $\langle L \rangle$ in $U(1)_r$-invariant vacua of the theory compactified on $S^1$. This relation can be expressed algebraically as a commutative diagram involving three algebras: the algebra generated by line defects, the algebra of functions on $U(1)_r$-invariant vacua, and a Verlinde-like algebra associated to $\mathcal{A}$. Our evidence is experimental, by direct computation in the Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,A_2)$, $(A_1,A_4)$, $(A_1, A_6)$, $(A_1, D_3)$ and $(A_1, D_5)$. In the latter two theories, which have flavor symmetries, the Verlinde-like algebra which appears is a new deformation of algebras previously considered.",2017-08-17T14:56:41Z,2017-12-12T18:59:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05323v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05323v2,"hep-th, math.AG, math.RT"

We show that the center of a flat pseudo-Euclidean nilpotent Lie algebra of signature $(2,n-2)$ must be degenerate and all flat pseudo-Euclidean nilpotent Lie algebras of signature $(2,n-2)$ can be obtained by using the double extension process from flat Lorentzian nilpotent Lie algebras. We show also that the center of a flat pseudo-Euclidean 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra is degenerate and all these Lie algebras are obtained by using a sequence of double extension from an abelian Lie algebra.

This is an noncommutative analogue of the famous theorem of Mather and Yau on isolated hypersurface singularities. We also prove that the right equivalence class of a potential is determined by its sufficiently high jet assuming the Jacobi algebra is finite dimensional. These two theorems can be viewed as a first step towards the singularity theory of noncommutative power series. As an application, we show that if the Jacobi algebra is finite dimensional then the corresponding complete Ginzburg dg-algebra, and the (topological) generalized cluster category thereof, are determined by the isomorphic type of the Jacobi algebra together with the class in its 0-th Hochschild homology represented by the potential.",2018-03-16T09:46:02Z,2019-08-26T09:04:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06128v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06128v5,"math.AG, math.RA, math.RT, 14-XX, 16-XX,"
Conformal properties of indefinite bi-invariant metrics,"Kelli Francis-Staite, Thomas Leistner","An indecomposable Lie group with Riemannian bi-invariant metric is always simple and hence Einstein. For indefinite metrics this is no longer true, not even for simple Lie groups. We study the question of whether a semi-Riemannian bi-invariant metric is conformal to an Einstein metric. We obtain results for all three cases in the structure theorem by Medina and Revoy for indecomposable metric Lie algebras: the case of simple Lie algebras, and the cases of double extensions of metric Lie algebras by $\mathbb{R}$ or a simple Lie algebra. Simple Lie algebras are conformally Einstein precisely when they are Einstein, or when equal to $\mathfrak{sl}_2\mathbb{C}$ and conformally flat. Double extensions of metric Lie algebras by simple Lie algebras of rank greater than one are never conformally Einstein, and neither are double extensions of Lorentzian oscillator algebras, whereas the oscillator algebras themselves are conformally Einstein.

Specifically, we construct a contravariant functor from the category of commutative Hopf algebroids with a fixed base algebra to that of Lie-Rinehart algebras over the same algebra, the differentiation functor, which can be seen as an algebraic counterpart to the differentiation process from Lie groupoids to Lie algebroids. The other way around, we provide two interrelated contravariant functors form the category of Lie-Rinehart algebras to that of commutative Hopf algebroids, the integration functors. One of them yields a contravariant adjunction together with the differentiation functor. Under mild conditions, essentially on the base algebra, the other integration functor only induces an adjunction at the level of Galois Hopf algebroids. By employing the differentiation functor, we also analyse the geometric separability of a given morphism of Hopf algebroids.

This generalizes and unifies various existing constructions of representations of many Lie algebras by using this new bifunctor. We construct some crossed homomorphisms in different situations and use our actions of monoidal categories to recover some known constructions of representations of various Lie algebras, also to obtain new representations for generalized Witt algebras and their Lie subalgebras.

Properties of that vertex algebra are shown to account for the key results about $\mathcal{H}_Q$. In particular, it has a natural structure of a vertex bialgebra, leading to a new interpretation of the product of $\mathcal{H}_Q$. Moreover, it is isomorphic to the universal enveloping vertex algebra of a certain vertex Lie algebra, which leads to a new interpretation of Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $Q$ (and, in particular, re-proves their positivity).

K-theoretic Hall algebras for quivers with potential,Tudor Pădurariu,"Given a quiver with potential $(Q,W)$, Kontsevich-Soibelman constructed a Hall algebra on the cohomology of the stack of representations of $(Q,W)$. As shown by Davison-Meinhardt, this algebra comes with a filtration whose associated graded algebra is supercommutative. A special case of this construction is related to work of Nakajima, Varagnolo, Maulik-Okounkov etc. about geometric constructions of Yangians and their representations; indeed, given a quiver $Q$, there exists an associated pair $(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{W})$ for which the CoHA is conjecturally the positive half of the Yangian $Y_{\text{MO}}(\mathfrak{g}_Q)$.   The goal of this article is to extend these ideas to K-theory. More precisely, we construct a K-theoretic Hall algebra using category of singularities, define a filtration whose associated graded algebra is a deformation of a symmetric algebra, and compare the $\text{KHA}$ and the $\text{CoHA}$ using the Chern character. As before, we expect our construction for the special class of quivers $(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{W})$ to recover the positive part of quantum affine algebra $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}_Q})$ defined by Okounkov-Smirnov, but for general pairs $(Q,W)$ we expect new phenomena.",2019-11-13T15:02:57Z,2019-11-13T15:02:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05526v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05526v1,"math.RT, math-ph, math.AG, math.MP, math.QA"

We characterise all the algebras with compact maximal spectrum as being \emph{quasihyperarchimedean} \mbox{MV-algebras,} which in a sense are non semisimple hyperarchimedean algebras. We develop some basic facts in the theory of MV-algebras along the lines of algebraic geometry, where infinitesimals play the role of nilpotent elements, and prove a MV-algebra version of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.

Algebraicity and Asymptotics: An explosion of BPS indices from algebraic   generating series,Tom Mainiero,"It is an observation of Kontsevich and Soibelman that generating series that produce certain (generalized) Donaldson Thomas invariants are secretly algebraic functions over the rationals. From a physical perspective this observation arises naturally for DT invariants that appear as BPS indices in theories of class S[A]: explicit algebraic equations (that completely determine these series) can be derived using (degenerate) spectral networks. In this paper, we conjecture an algebraic equation associated to DT invariants for the Kronecker 3-quiver with dimension vectors (3n,2n), n>0 in the non-trivial region of its stability parameter space. Using a functional equation due to Reineke, we show algebraicity of generating series for Euler characteristics of stable moduli for the Kronecker m-quiver assuming algebraicity of generating series for DT invariants. In the latter part of the paper we deduce very explicit results on the asymptotics of DT invariants/Euler characteristics under the assumption of algebraicity of their generating series; explicit large n asymptotics are deduced for dimension vectors (3n,2n) for the Kronecker 3-quiver.

Algebraic subellipticity and dominability of blow-ups of affine spaces,"Finnur Larusson, Tuyen Trung Truong","Little is known about the behaviour of the Oka property of a complex manifold with respect to blowing up a submanifold. A manifold is of Class $\mathscr A$ if it is the complement of an algebraic subvariety of codimension at least $2$ in an algebraic manifold that is Zariski-locally isomorphic to $\mathbb C^n$. A manifold of Class $\mathscr A$ is algebraically subelliptic and hence Oka, and a manifold of Class $\mathscr A$ blown up at finitely many points is of Class $\mathscr A$. Our main result is that a manifold of Class $\mathscr A$ blown up along an arbitrary algebraic submanifold (not necessarily connected) is algebraically subelliptic. For algebraic manifolds in general, we prove that strong algebraic dominability, a weakening of algebraic subellipticity, is preserved by an arbitrary blow-up with a smooth centre.

The global dimension of the algebras of polynomial integro-differential   operators $\mathbb{I}_n$ and the Jacobian algebras $\mathbb{A}_n$,V. V. Bavula,"The aim of the paper is to prove two conjectures that the (left and right) global dimension of the algebra of polynomial integro-differential operators $\mathbb{I}_n$ and the Jacobian algebra $\mathbb{A}_n$ is equal to $n$ (over a field of characteristic zero). An analogue of Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem is proven for them. The algebras $\mathbb{I}_n$ and $\mathbb{A}_n$ are neither left nor right Noetherian. Furthermore, they contain infinite direct sums of nonzero left/right ideals and are not domains. It is proven that the global dimension of all prime factor algebras of the algebras $\mathbb{I}_n$ and $\mathbb{A}_n$ is $n$ and the weak global dimension of all the factor algebras of $\mathbb{I}_n$ and $\mathbb{I}_n$ is $n$.",2017-05-11T19:05:24Z,2017-05-11T19:05:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05227v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05227v1,"math.RA, math.AG"
A generalization of cancellative dimer algebras to hyperbolic surfaces,"Karin Baur, Charlie Beil","We study a new class of quiver algebras on surfaces, called 'geodesic ghor algebras'. These algebras generalize cancellative dimer algebras on a torus to higher genus surfaces, where the relations come from perfect matchings rather than a potential. Although cancellative dimer algebras on a torus are noncommutative crepant resolutions, the center of any dimer algebra on a higher genus surface is just the polynomial ring in one variable, and so the center and surface are unrelated. In contrast, we establish a rich interplay between the central geometry of geodesic ghor algebras and the topology of the surface in which they are embedded. Furthermore, we show that noetherian central localizations of such algebras are endomorphism rings of modules over their centers.",2021-01-27T16:14:18Z,2021-09-10T17:59:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11512v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11512v2,math.RA
Consequences of the compatibility of skein algebra and cluster algebra   on surfaces,"Han-Bom Moon, Helen Wong","We investigate two algebra of curves on a topological surface with punctures - the cluster algebra of surfaces defined by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston, and the generalized skein algebra constructed by Roger and Yang.

Juyumaya and generalized to all types by Marin), providing a connection between geometric representation theory and an algebra defined in the context of knot theory. Our geometric interpretation of this algebra entails some algebraic consequences: we obtain a short and type-independent geometric proof of the braid relations for Juyumaya's generators of the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra (previously proved case-by-case in types $A, D, E$ by Juyumaya and separately for types $B, C, F_4, G_2$ by Juyumaya and S.

The Lefschetz properties of graded Artinian algebras have been long studied, but more recently the Jordan type invariant of a pair $(\ell,A)$ where $\ell$ is an element of the maximal ideal of $A$, has been introduced. The Jordan type gives the sizes of the Jordan blocks for multiplication by $\ell$ on $A$, and it is a finer invariant than the pair $(\ell,A)$ being strong or weak Lefschetz. The Jordan degree type for a graded Artinian algebra adds to the Jordan type the initial degree of ``strings'' in the decomposition of $A$ as a $\mathsf{k}[\ell]$ module.

Quantum duality principle and quantum symmetric pairs,Jinfeng Song,"The quantum duality principal (QDP) by Drinfeld predicts a connection between the quantized universial enveloping algebras and the quantized coordinate algebras, where the underlying classical objects are related by the duality in Poisson geometry. The current paper gives an explicit formulization of the QDP for quantum symmetric pairs.   Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex semi-simple Lie algebra, equipped with the standard Lie bialgebra structure. Let $\theta$ be a Lie algebra involution on $\mathfrak{g}$ and denote by $\mathfrak{k}=\mathfrak{g}^\theta$ the fixed point subalgebra. The quantum symmetric pair $(\mathrm{U},\mathrm{U}^\imath)$ is originally defined to be a quantization of the symmetric pair of the universial enveloping algebras $(U(\mathfrak{g}),U(\mathfrak{k}))$. In this paper, we show that an explicit specialisation of $(\mathrm{U},\mathrm{U}^\imath)$ gives rise to the pair of the coordinate algebras $(\mathcal{O}(G^*),\mathcal{O}(K^\perp\backslash G^*))$, where $G^*$ is the dual Poisson-Lie group with the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^*$, and $K^\perp\backslash G^*$ is a $G^*$-Poisson homogeneous space. Here $K^\perp$ is the closed subgroup of $G^*$associated to the complementary dual of $\mathfrak{k}$. Therefore $(\mathrm{U},\mathrm{U}^\imath)$ can be viewed as a pair of quantized coordinate algebras. This generalises the well-known fact that the quantum group $\mathrm{U}$ provides a quantization of the coordinate algebra $\mathcal{O}(G^*)$.",2024-03-08T09:13:27Z,2024-09-24T08:29:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05167v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05167v2,"math.QA, math.RT"
The motivic Hecke algebra for PEL Shimura varieties,Mattia Cavicchi,"We construct a motivic lift of the action of the Hecke algebra on the cohomology of PEL Shimura varieties $S_K$. To do so, when $S_K$ is associated with a reductive algebraic group $G$ and $V$ is a local system on $S_K$ coming from a $G$-representation, we define a motivic Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}^M(G,K)$ as a natural sub-algebra of the endomorphism algebra, in the triangulated category of motives, of the constructible motive associated with $S_K$ and $V$. The algebra $\mathcal{H}^M(G,K)$ is such that realizations induce an epimorphism from it onto the classical Hecke algebra. We then consider Wildeshaus' theory of interior motives, along with the necessary hypotheses for it to be employed. Whenever those assumptions hold, one gets a Chow motive realizing to interior $V$-valued cohomology of $S_K$, equipped with an action of $\mathcal{H}^M(G,K)$ as an algebra of correspondences modulo rational equivalence.

They are analogue of the horizontal and the vertical subalgebras in the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa}(g_tor).

Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $>1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $>1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which finite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c) again algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.",2024-07-29T16:30:02Z,2025-01-21T11:20:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20154v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20154v3,"math.QA, math.AG, math.CT, math.RA, 16T05, 16T15, 18A30, 12F05, 14L30, 20G15, 16T20, 18N10, 18C15, 18C20"
Derived deformation theory of algebraic structures,"Gregory Ginot, Sinan Yalin","The main purpose of this article is to develop an explicit derived deformation theory of algebraic structures at a high level of generality, encompassing in a common framework various kinds of algebras (associative, commutative, Poisson...) or bialgebras (associative and coassociative, Lie, Frobenius...), that is algebraic structures parametrized by props. A central aspect is that we define and study moduli spaces of deformations of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms (and not just isotopies or isomorphisms). To do so, we implement methods coming from derived algebraic geometry, by encapsulating these deformation theories as classifying (pre)stacks with good infinitesimal properties and derived formal geometry, by means of derived formal moduli problems and derived formal groups. In particular, we prove that the Lie algebra describing the deformation theory of an object in a given $\infty$-category of dg algebras can be obtained equivalently as the tangent complex of loops on a derived quotient of this moduli space by the homotopy automorphims of this object. Moreover, we provide explicit formulae for such derived deformation problems of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms and relate them in a precise way to other standard deformation problems of algebraic structures. This relation is given by a fiber sequence of the associated dg-Lie algebras of their deformation complexes. Our results provide simultaneously a vast generalization of standard deformation theory of algebraic structures which is suitable (and needed) to set up algebraic deformation theory both at the $\infty$-categorical level and at a higher level of generality than algebras over operads. In addition, we study a general criterion to compare formal moduli problems of different algebraic structures and apply our formalism to $E_n$-algebras and bialgebras.",2019-10-16T10:00:17Z,2024-05-25T09:51:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07255v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07255v2,"math.AT, math.QA"

This is used to show that the Woronowicz quantum universal enveloping algebra $U(g_\Gamma)$ is a bialgebra in the braided category of $A$-comodules. We show that this algebra is quadratic when the calculus is inner. Examples with this unexpected property include finite groups and quantum groups with their standard differential calculi. We also find a quantum Lie functor for coquasitriangular Hopf algebras, which has properties analogous to the classical one. This functor gives trivial results on standard quantum groups $O_q(G)$, but reasonable ones on examples closer to the classical case, such as the cotriangular Jordanian deformations. In addition, we show that split braided Lie algebras define `generalised-Lie algebras' in a different sense of deforming the adjoint representation.

Ignoring non-Noetherian property, the algebra $\mS_n$ belongs to a family of algebras like the Weyl algebra $A_n$ and the polynomial algebra $P_{2n}$. The group of automorphisms $G_n$ of the algebra $\mS_n$ is found: $$ G_n=S_n\ltimes \mT^n\ltimes \Inn (\mS_n) \supseteq S_n\ltimes \mT^n\ltimes \underbrace{\GL_\infty (K)\ltimes... \ltimes \GL_\infty (K)}_{2^n-1 {\rm times}}=:G_n' $$ where $S_n$ is the symmetric group, $\mT^n$ is the $n$-dimensional torus, $\Inn (\mS_n)$ is the group of inner automorphisms of $\mS_n$ (which is huge), and $\GL_\infty (K)$ is the group of invertible infinite dimensional matrices.

The local integration of Leibniz algebras,Simon Covez,"This article gives a local answer to the coquecigrue problem. Hereby we mean the problem, formulated by J-L. Loday in \cite{LodayEns}, is that of finding a generalization of the Lie's third theorem for Leibniz algebra. That is, we search a manifold provided with an algebraic structure which generalizes the structure of a (local) Lie group, and such that the tangent space at a distinguished point is a Leibniz algebra structure. Moreover, when the Leibniz algebra is a Lie algebra, we want that the integrating manifold is a Lie group. In his article \cite{Kinyon}, M.K. Kinyon solves the particular case of split Leibniz algebras. He shows, in particular, that the tangent space at the neutral element of a Lie rack is provided with a Leibniz algebra structure. Hence it seemed reasonable to think that Lie racks give a solution to the coquecigrue problem, but M.K. Kinyon also showed that a Lie algebra can be integrated into a Lie rack which is not a Lie group. Therefore, we have to specify inside the category of Lie racks, which objects are the coquecigrues. In this article we give a local solution to this problem. We show that every Leibniz algebra becomes integrated into a \textit{local augmented Lie rack}. The proof is inspired by E. Cartan's proof of Lie's third theorem, and, viewing a Leibniz algebra as a central extension by some center, proceeds by integrating explicitely the corresponding Leibniz 2-cocycle into a rack 2-cocycle. This proof gives us a way to construct local augmented Lie racks which integrate Leibniz algebras, and this article ends with examples of the integration of non split Leibniz algebras in dimension 4 and 5.",2010-11-18T00:20:58Z,2012-07-04T17:29:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4112v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.4112v2,"math.RA, math.DG"
Quiver Schur algebras and q-Fock space,"Catharina Stroppel, Ben Webster","We develop a graded version of the theory of cyclotomic q-Schur algebras, in the spirit of the work of Brundan-Kleshchev on Hecke algebras and of Ariki on q-Schur algebras. As an application, we identify the coefficients of the canonical basis on a higher level Fock space with q-analogues of the decomposition numbers of cyclotomic q-Schur algebras.   We present cyclotomic q-Schur algebras as a quotient of a convolution algebra arising in the geometry of quivers; hence we call these quiver Schur algebras. These algebras are also presented diagrammatically, similar in flavor to a recent construction of Khovanov and Lauda. They are also manifestly graded and so equip the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra with a non-obvious grading.   On the way we construct a graded cellular basis of this algebra, resembling the constructions for cyclotomic Hecke algebras by Mathas, Hu, Brundan and the first author.   The quiver Schur algebra is also interesting from the perspective of higher representation theory. The sum of Grothendieck groups of certain cyclotomic quotients is known to agree with a higher level Fock space. We show that our graded version defines a higher q-Fock space (defined as a tensor product of level 1 q-deformed Fock spaces). Under this identification, the indecomposable projective modules are identified with the canonical basis and the Weyl modules with the standard basis. This allows us to prove the already described relation between decomposition numbers and canonical bases.",2011-10-05T23:11:52Z,2014-07-15T21:38:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1115v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1115v2,"math.RA, math.RT"
Quantum Algebras Associated to Irreducible Generalized Flag Manifolds,Matthew Tucker-Simmons,"The first part of this thesis deals with certain properties of the quantum symmetric and exterior algebras of Type 1 representations of $U_q(g)$ defined by Berenstein and Zwicknagl. We define a notion of a commutative algebra object in a coboundary category, and we prove that the quantum symmetric algebra of a module is the universal commutative algebra generated by that module. That is, the functor assigning to a module its quantum symmetric algebra is left adjoint to a forgetful functor. We also prove a conjecture of Berenstein and Zwicknagl, stating that the quantum symmetric and exterior cubes exhibit the same amount of ""collapsing"" relative to their classical counterparts. We prove that those quantum exterior algebras that are flat deformations of their classical analogues are Frobenius algebras. We also develop a rigorous framework for discussing continuity and limits of the structures involved as the deformation parameter q varies along the positive real line.   The second part deals with quantum analogues of Clifford algebras and their application to the noncommutative geometry of certain quantum homogeneous spaces. We introduce the quantum Clifford algebra through its spinor representation via creation and annihilation operators on one of the flat quantum exterior algebras discussed in the first part. The proof that the spinor representation is irreducible relies on the Frobenius property discussed previously. We use this quantum Clifford algebra to revisit Krahmer's construction of a Dolbeault-Dirac-type operator on a quantized irreducible flag manifold. This operator is of the form $d+d^*$, and we relate $d$ to the boundary operator for the Koszul complex of a certain quantum symmetric algebra, which shows that $d^2=0$.

Four-Dimensional Algebraic Tori,Nicole Lemire,"The study of the birational properties of algebraic $k$-tori began in the sixties and seventies with work of Voskresenkii, Endo, Miyata, Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc. There was particular interest in determining the rationality of a given algebraic $k$-tori. As rationality problems for algebraic varieties are in general difficult, it is natural to consider relaxed notions such as stable rationality, or even retract rationality. Work of the above authors and later Saltman in the eighties determined necessary and sufficient conditions to determine when an algebraic torus is stably rational, respectively retract rational in terms of the integral representations of its associated character lattice. An interesting question is to ask whether a stably rational algebraic $k$-torus is always rational. In the general case, there exist examples of non-rational stably rational $k$-varieties. Algebraic $k$-tori of dimension $r$ are classified up to isomorphism by conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of GL$_r(\mathbb{Z})$. This makes it natural to examine the rationality problem for algebraic $k$-tori of small dimensions. In 1967, Voskresenskii proved that all algebraic tori of dimension 2 are rational. In 1990, Kunyavskii determined which algebraic tori of dimension 3 were rational. In 2012, Hoshi and Yamasaki determined which algebraic tori of dimensions 4 and 5 were stably (respectively retract) rational with the aid of GAP. They did not address the rationality question in dimensions 4 and 5. In this paper, we show that all stably rational algebraic $k$-tori of dimension 4 are rational, with the possible exception of 10 undetermined cases which fall into 2 families.

Three dimensional Sklyanin algebras and Groebner bases,"Natalia Iyudu, Stanislav Shkarin","We consider a Sklyanin algebra S with 3 generators, which is the quadratic algebra over a field k with three generators x,y,z given by three relations pxy+qyx+rzz=0, pyz+qzy+rxx=0 and pzx+qxz+ryy=0, where p,q,r are parameters from the fileld k. This class of algebras enjoyed much of attention, in particular, using tools from algebraic geometry, Feigin & Odesskii, and Artin, Tate & Van den Berg, showed that if at least two of the parameters p, q and r are non-zero and at least two of three numbers p^3,q^3 and r^3 are distinct, then S is Koszul and has the same Hilbert series as the algebra of commutative polynomials in three variables. It became commonly accepted, that it is impossible to achieve the same objective by purely algebraic and combinatorial means, like the Groebner basis technique. The main purpose of this paper is to trace combinatorial meaning of the properties of Sklyanin algebras, such as Koszulity, PBW, PHS, Calabi-Yau, and to give a new constructive proof of the above facts due to Artin, Tate and Van den Bergh.   Further, we study a wider class of Sklyanin algebras, namely the situation when all parameters of relations could be different. This class called generalized Sklyanin algebras. We classify up to isomorphism genralized Sklyanin algebras with polynomial Hilbert series.

"Symplectic, product and complex structures on 3-Lie algebras","Yunhe Sheng, Rong Tang","In this paper, first we introduce the notion of a phase space of a 3-Lie algebra and show that a 3-Lie algebra has a phase space if and only if it is sub-adjacent to a 3-pre-Lie algebra. Then we introduce the notion of a product structure on a 3-Lie algebra using the Nijenhuis condition as the integrability condition. A 3-Lie algebra enjoys a product structure if and only if it is the direct sum (as vector spaces) of two subalgebras. We find that there are four types special integrability conditions, and each of them gives rise to a special decomposition of the original 3-Lie algebra. They are also related to $\huaO$-operators, Rota-Baxter operators and matched pairs of 3-Lie algebras. Parallelly, we introduce the notion of a complex structure on a 3-Lie algebra and there are also four types special integrability conditions. Finally, we add compatibility conditions between a complex structure and a product structure, between a symplectic structure and a paracomplex structure, between a symplectic structure and a complex structure, to introduce the notions of a complex product structure, a para-K\""{a}hler structure and a pseudo-K\""{a}hler structure on a 3-Lie algebra. We use 3-pre-Lie algebras to construct these structures. Furthermore, a Levi-Civita product is introduced associated to a pseudo-Riemannian 3-Lie algebra and deeply studied.",2017-11-19T14:59:15Z,2017-11-19T14:59:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08381v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08381v1,"math.RA, math-ph, math.DG, math.MP"
"Rota-Baxter Lie bialgebras, classical Yang-Baxter equations and special   L-dendriform bialgebras","Chengming Bai, Li Guo, Guilai Liu, Tianshui Ma","We establish a bialgebra structure on Rota-Baxter Lie algebras following the Manin triple approach to Lie bialgebras. Explicitly, Rota-Baxter Lie bialgebras are characterized by generalizing matched pairs of Lie algebras and Manin triples of Lie algebras to the context of Rota-Baxter Lie algebras. The coboundary case leads to the introduction of the admissible classical Yang-Baxter equation (CYBE) in Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, for which the antisymmetric solutions give rise to Rota-Baxter Lie bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal{O}$-operators on Rota-Baxter Lie algebras and Rota-Baxter pre-Lie algebras are introduced to produce antisymmetric solutions of the admissible CYBE. Furthermore, extending the well-known property that a Rota-Baxter Lie algebra of weight zero induces a pre-Lie algebra, the Rota-Baxter Lie bialgebra of weight zero induces a bialgebra structure of independent interest, namely the special L-dendriform bialgebra, which is equivalent to a Lie group with a left-invariant flat pseudo-metric in geometry. This induction is also characterized as the inductions between the corresponding Manin triples and matched pairs. Finally, antisymmetric solutions of the admissible CYBE in a Rota-Baxter Lie algebra of weight zero give special L-dendriform bialgebras. In particular, both Rota-Baxter algebras of weight zero and Rota-Baxter pre-Lie algebras of weight zero can be used to construct special L-dendriform algebras.",2022-07-18T15:52:37Z,2022-07-18T15:52:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08703v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08703v1,"math.QA, math-ph, math.MP, 17B38, 17B62, 17B10, 16T25, 17A30, 17A36, 17D25"
Non-linear Embeddings in Hilbert Simplex Geometry,"Frank Nielsen, Ke Sun","A key technique of machine learning and computer vision is to embed discrete weighted graphs into continuous spaces for further downstream processing. Embedding discrete hierarchical structures in hyperbolic geometry has proven very successful since it was shown that any weighted tree can be embedded in that geometry with arbitrary low distortion. Various optimization methods for hyperbolic embeddings based on common models of hyperbolic geometry have been studied. In this paper, we consider Hilbert geometry for the standard simplex which is isometric to a vector space equipped with the variation polytope norm. We study the representation power of this Hilbert simplex geometry by embedding distance matrices of graphs. Our findings demonstrate that Hilbert simplex geometry is competitive to alternative geometries such as the Poincar\'e hyperbolic ball or the Euclidean geometry for embedding tasks while being fast and numerically robust.",2022-03-22T03:13:39Z,2023-08-16T05:39:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11434v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11434v3,cs.LG
The Higher Cohomologies of E_8 Lie Algebra,"H. R. Karadayi, M. Gungormez","It is well known that anomaly cancellations for D_16 Lie algebra are at the root of the first string revolution. For E_8 Lie algebra, cancellation of anomalies is the principal fact leading to the existence of heterotic string. They are in fact nothing but the 6th order cohomologies of corresponding Lie algebras. Beyond 6th order, the calculations seem to require special care and it could be that their study will be worthwhile in the light of developments of the second string revolution.   As we have shown in a recent article, for A_N Lie algebras, there is a method which are based on the calculations of Casimir eigenvalues. This is extended to E_8 Lie algebra in the present article. In the generality of any irreducible representation of E_8 Lie algebra, we consider 8th and 12th order cohomologies while emphasizing the diversities between the two. It is seen that one can respectively define 2 and 8 basic invariant polinomials in terms of which 8th and 12th order Casimir eigenvalues are always expressed as linear superpositions. All these can be easily investigated because each one of these invariant polinimials gives us a linear equation to calculate E_8 weight multiplicities. Our results beyond order 12 are not included here because they get more complicated though share the same characteristic properties with 12th order calculations.",1997-05-08T12:24:27Z,1997-05-08T12:24:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9705051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9705051v1,"hep-th, alg-geom, math.AG, math.QA, q-alg"
Differential Algebras with Dense Singularities on Manifolds,Elemer E Rosinger,"Recently the space-time foam differential algebras of generalized functions with dense singularities were introduced, motivated by the so called space-time foam structures in General Relativity with dense singularities, and by Quantum Gravity. A variety of applications of these algebras has been presented, among them, a global Cauchy-Kovalevskaia theorem, de Rham cohomology in abstract differential geometry, and so on. So far the space-time foam algebras have only been constructed on Euclidean spaces. In this paper, owing to their relevance in General Relativity among others, the construction of these algebras is extended to arbitrary finite dimensional smooth manifolds. Since these algebras contain the Schwartz distributions, the extension of their construction to manifolds also solves the long outstanding problem of defining distributions on manifolds, and doing so in ways compatible with nonlinear operations. Earlier, similar attempts were made in the literature with respect to the extension of the Colombeau algebras to manifolds, algebras which also contain the distributions. These attempts have encountered significant technical difficulties, owing to the growth condition type limitations the elements of Colombeau algebras have to satisfy near singularities. Since in this paper no any type of such or other growth conditions are required in the construction of space-time foam algebras, their extension to manifolds proceeds in a surprisingly easy and natural way. It is also shown that the space-time foam algebras form a fine and flabby sheaf, properties which are important in securing a considerably large class of singularities which generalized functions can handle.",2006-06-15T12:36:25Z,2006-06-15T12:36:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606358v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0606358v1,"math.DG, math-ph, math.MP"
On the noncommutative geometry of square superpotential algebras,Charlie Beil,"A superpotential algebra is square if its quiver admits an embedding into a two-torus such that the image of its underlying graph is a square grid, possibly with diagonal edges in the unit squares; examples are provided by dimer models in physics. Such an embedding reveals much of the algebras representation theory through a device we introduce called an impression. Let A be a square superpotential algebra, Z its center, and \mathfrak{m} the maximal ideal at the origin of Spec(Z). Using an impression, we give a classification of all simple A-modules up to isomorphism, and give algebraic and homological characterizations of the simple A-modules of maximal k-dimension; show that Z is a 3-dimensional normal toric domain and Z_{\mathfrak{m}} is Gorenstein, by determining transcendence bases and Z-regular sequences; and show that A_{\mathfrak{m}} is a noncommutative crepant resolution of Z_{\mathfrak{m}}, and thus a local Calabi-Yau algebra.   A particular class of square superpotential algebras, the Y^{p,q} algebras, is considered in detail. We show that the Azumaya and smooth loci of the centers coincide, and propose that each ramified maximal ideal sitting over the singular locus is the exceptional locus of a blowup shrunk to zero size.",2008-11-17T20:59:53Z,2012-07-26T21:34:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2439v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2439v4,"math.AG, hep-th, math.RT, 14M25, 16G20"
Algebraic Geometry of Topological Spaces I,"Guillermo Cortiñas, Andreas Thom","We use techniques from both real and complex algebraic geometry to study K-theoretic and related invariants of the algebra C(X) of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space X. For example, we prove a parametrized version of a theorem of Joseph Gubeladze; we show that if M is a countable, abelian, cancellative, torsion-free, seminormal monoid, and X is contractible, then every finitely generated projective module over C(X)[M] is free. The particular case when M=N^n gives a parametrized version of the celebrated theorem proved independently by Daniel Quillen and Andrei Suslin that finitely generated projective modules over a polynomial ring over a field are free. The conjecture of Jonathan Rosenberg which predicts the homotopy invariance of the negative algebraic K-theory of C(X) follows from the particular case when M=Z^n. We also give algebraic conditions for a functor from commutative algebras to abelian groups to be homotopy invariant on C*-algebras, and for a homology theory of commutative algebras to vanish on C*-algebras. These criteria have numerous applications. For example, the vanishing criterion applied to nil-K-theory implies that commutative C*-algebras are K-regular. As another application, we show that the familiar formulas of Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg and Loday-Quillen for the algebraic Hochschild and cyclic homology of the coordinate ring of a smooth algebraic variety remain valid for the algebraic Hochschild and cyclic homology of C(X). Applications to the conjectures of Beilinson-Soule and Farrell-Jones are also given.",2009-12-18T10:40:50Z,2011-03-30T14:42:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3635v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.3635v3,"math.RA, math.FA, math.GN, math.KT"
Potentials of a family of arrangements of hyperplanes and elementary   subarrangements,"Andrew Prudhom, Alexander Varchenko",We consider the Frobenius algebra of functions on the critical set of the master function of a weighted arrangement of hyperplanes in $\C^k$ with normal crossings. We construct two potential functions (of first and second kind) of variables labeled by hyperplanes of the arrangement and prove that the matrix coefficients of the Grothendieck residue bilinear form on the algebra are given by the $2k$-th derivatives of the potential function of first kind and the matrix coefficients of the multiplication operators on the algebra are given by the $(2k+1)$-st derivatives of the potential function of second kind. Thus the two potentials completely determine the Frobenius algebra. The presence of these potentials is a manifestation of a Frobenius like structure similar to the Frobenius manifold structure.   We introduce the notion of an elementary subarrangement of an arrangement with normal crossings. It turns out that our potential functions are local in the sense that the potential functions are sums of contributions from elementary subarrangements of the given arrangement. This is a new phenomenon of locality of the Grothendieck residue bilinear form and multiplication on the algebra.   It is known that this Frobenius algebra of functions on the critical set is isomorphic to the Bethe algebra of this arrangement. (That Bethe algebra is an analog of the Bethe algebras in the theory of quantum integrable models.) Thus our potential functions describe that Bethe algebra too.,2016-11-12T03:06:49Z,2016-12-16T15:33:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03944v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03944v2,"math.AG, math.DG, nlin.SI"
Affine stacks (Champs affines),B. Toen,"This is an expended and revised version of the preprint ""Schematization of homotopy types"".   The purpose of this work is to introduce a notion of \emph{affine stacks}, which is a homotopy version of the notion of affine schemes, and to give several applications in the context of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. As a first application we show how affine stacks can be used in order to give a new point of view (and new proofs) on rational and $p$-adic homotopy theory. This gives a first solution to A. Grothendieck's \emph{schematization problem} described in \cite{gr}. We also use affine stacks in order to introduce a notion of \emph{schematic homotopy types}. We show that schematic homotopy types give a second solution to the schematization problem, which also allows us to go beyound rational and $p$-adic homotopy theory for spaces with arbitrary fundamental groups. The notion of schematic homotopy types is also used in order to construct various homotopy types of algebraic varieties corresponding to various cohomology theories (Betti, de Rham, $l$-adic, ...), extending the well known constructions of the various fundamental groups. Finally, as algebraic stacks are obtained by gluing affine schemes we define \emph{$\infty$-geometric stacks} as a certain gluing of affine stacks. Example of $\infty$-geometric stacks in the context of algebraic topology (moduli spaces of dga structures up to quasi-isomorphisms) and Hodge theory (non-abelian periods) are given.",2000-12-21T14:58:57Z,2006-04-25T10:22:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0012219v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0012219v6,"math.AG, math.AT, math.CT"
Differentials of higher order in non commutative differential geometry,Robert Coquereaux,"In differential geometry, the notation d^n f along with the corresponding formalism has fallen into disuse since the birth of exterior calculus. However, differentials of higher order are useful objects that can be interpreted in terms of functions on iterated tangent bundles (or in terms of jets). We generalize this notion to the case of non commutative differential geometry. For an arbitrary associative algebra A, one already knows how to define the differential algebra Omega(A) of universal differential forms over A. We define Leibniz forms of order n (these are not forms of degree n, ie they are not elements of Omega^n A) as particular elements of what we call the ``iterated frame algebra'' of order n, F_n A, which is itself defined as the 2^n tensor power of the algebra A. We give a system of generators for this iterated frame algebra and identify the A-module of forms of order n as a particular vector subspace included in the space of universal one-forms built over the iterated frame algebra of order n-1. We study the algebraic structure of these objects, recover the case of the commutative differential calculus of order n (Leibniz differentials) and give a few examples.",1996-12-30T17:28:37Z,1996-12-30T17:28:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9612015v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9612015v1,"math-ph, hep-th, math.MP, math.QA, q-alg"
Exact Symbolic-Numeric Computation of Planar Algebraic Curves,"Eric Berberich, Pavel Emeliyanenko, Alexander Kobel, Michael Sagraloff","We present a novel certified and complete algorithm to compute arrangements of real planar algebraic curves. It provides a geometric-topological analysis of the decomposition of the plane induced by a finite number of algebraic curves in terms of a cylindrical algebraic decomposition. From a high-level perspective, the overall method splits into two main subroutines, namely an algorithm denoted Bisolve to isolate the real solutions of a zero-dimensional bivariate system, and an algorithm denoted GeoTop to analyze a single algebraic curve.   Compared to existing approaches based on elimination techniques, we considerably improve the corresponding lifting steps in both subroutines. As a result, generic position of the input system is never assumed, and thus our algorithm never demands for any change of coordinates. In addition, we significantly limit the types of involved exact operations, that is, we only use resultant and gcd computations as purely symbolic operations. The latter results are achieved by combining techniques from different fields such as (modular) symbolic computation, numerical analysis and algebraic geometry.   We have implemented our algorithms as prototypical contributions to the C++-project CGAL. They exploit graphics hardware to expedite the symbolic computations. We have also compared our implementation with the current reference implementations, that is, LGP and Maple's Isolate for polynomial system solving, and CGAL's bivariate algebraic kernel for analyses and arrangement computations of algebraic curves.

Extensions of Lie algebras of differential operators,Helge Øystein Maakestad,"The aim of this note is to introduce the notion of a $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra and to prove some elementary properties of $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebras, the category of $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebras, the category of modules on a $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra and extensions of $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebras. A $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra is an $A/k$-Lie-Rinehart algebra equipped with an $A\otimes_k A$-module structure and a canonical central element $D$ and a compatibility property between the $k$-Lie algebra structure and the $A\otimes_k A$-module structure. Several authors have studied non-abelian extensions of Lie algebras, super Lie algebras, Lie algebroids and holomorphic Lie algebroids and we give in this note an explicit constructions of all non-abelian extensions a $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra $\tilde{L}$ by an $A$-Lie algebra $(W,[,])$ where $\tilde{L}$ is projective as left $A$-module and $W$ is an $A\otimes_k A$-module with $IW=0$ for $I$ the kernel of the multiplication map.

Quantum entanglement and geometry of determinantal varieties,Hao Chen,"Quantum entanglement was first recognized as a feature of quantum mechanics in the famous paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [18]. Recently it has been realized that quantum entanglement is a key ingredient in quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum cryptography ([16],[17],[6]). In this paper, we introduce algebraic sets, which are determinantal varieties in the complex projective spaces or the products of complex projective spaces, for the mixed states in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under local unitary transformations. These invariants are naturally arised from the physical consideration of measuring mixed states by separable pure states. In this way algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry of these algebraic sets turn to be powerful tools for the understanding of quantum enatanglement. Our construction has applications in the following important topics in quantum information theory: 1) separability criterion, it is proved the algebraic sets have to be the sum of the linear subspaces if the mixed states are separable; 2) lower bound of Schmidt numbers, that is, generic low rank bipartite mixed states are entangled in many degrees of freedom; 3) simulation of Hamiltonians, it is proved the simulation of semi-positive Hamiltonians of the same rank implies the projective isomorphisms of the corresponding algebraic sets; 4) construction of bound enatanglement, examples of the entangled mixed states which are invariant under partial transpositions (thus PPT bound entanglement) are constructed systematically from our new separability criterion. On the other hand many examples of entangled mixed states with rich algebraic-geometric structure in their associated determinantal varieties are constructed and studied from this point of view.",2001-10-17T06:27:49Z,2003-10-17T13:41:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110103v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0110103v3,"quant-ph, cs.IT, math.AG, math.IT"
"Information Geometry, Jordan Algebras, and a Coadjoint Orbit-Like   Construction","Florio M. Ciaglia, Jürgen Jost, Lorenz Schwachhöfer","Jordan algebras arise naturally in (quantum) information geometry, and we want to understand their role and their structure within that framework. Inspired by Kirillov's discussion of the symplectic structure on coadjoint orbits, we provide a similar construction in the case of real Jordan algebras. Given a real, finite-dimensional, formally real Jordan algebra ${\mathcal J}$, we exploit the generalized distribution determined by the Jordan product on the dual ${\mathcal J}^{\star}$ to induce a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor on the leaves of the distribution. In particular, these leaves are the orbits of a Lie group, which is the structure group of ${\mathcal J}$, in clear analogy with what happens for coadjoint orbits. However, this time in contrast with the Lie-algebraic case, we prove that not all points in ${\mathcal J}^{*}$ lie on a leaf of the canonical Jordan distribution. When the leaves are contained in the cone of positive linear functionals on ${\mathcal J}$, the pseudo-Riemannian structure becomes Riemannian and, for appropriate choices of ${\mathcal J}$, it coincides with the Fisher-Rao metric on non-normalized probability distributions on a finite sample space, or with the Bures-Helstrom metric for non-normalized, faithful quantum states of a finite-level quantum system, thus showing a direct link between the mathematics of Jordan algebras and both classical and quantum information geometry.",2021-12-17T21:51:40Z,2023-10-20T06:26:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09781v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09781v3,"math.DG, math-ph, math.MP, math.RA, 17C20, 17C27, 17B60, 53B12"
On Lipschitz Geometry at infinity of complex analytic sets,José Edson Sampaio,"In this article, we study the Lipschitz Geometry at infinity of complex analytic sets and we obtain results on algebraicity of analytic sets and on Bernstein's problem. Moser's Bernstein Theorem says that a minimal hypersurface which is a graph of an entire Lipschitz function must be a hyperplane. H. B. Lawson, Jr. and R. Osserman presented examples showing that an analogous result for arbitrary codimension is not true. In this article, we prove a complex non-parametric version of Moser's Bernstein Theorem. More precisely, we prove that any entire complex analytic set in $\mathbb{C}^n$ which is Lipschitz regular at infinity must be an affine linear subspace of $\mathbb{C}^n$. In particular, a complex analytic set which is a graph of an entire Lipschitz function must be affine linear subspace. That result comes as a consequence of the following characterization of algebraic sets, which is also proved here: if $X$ and $Y$ are entire complex analytic sets which are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic at infinity then $X$ is a complex algebraic set if and only if $Y$ is a complex algebraic set too. Thus, an entire complex analytic set is a complex algebraic set if and only if it is bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic at infinity to a complex algebraic set. No restrictions on the singular set, dimension nor codimension are required in the results proved here.",2022-07-15T18:27:23Z,2022-07-15T18:27:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07692v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07692v1,"math.CV, math.AG, math.DG, 32S20, 14B05, 32A15, 32S50"
Traces and Differential Operators over Beilinson Completion Algebras,Amnon Yekutieli,"A Beilinson completion algebra (BCA) A is a complete semilocal algebra over a perfect field k, whose residue fields are high dimensional local fields. In addition A is a semi-topological algebra. The completion of the structure sheaf of an algebraic k-variety along a saturated chain of points is the prototypical example of a BCA. We single out two kinds of homomorphisms between BCAs: morphisms and intensifications. The first kind includes residually finite local homomorphisms, whereas the second kind is a sort of localization. We prove that every BCA A has a dual module K(A), and these dual modules are contravariant w.r.t. morphisms and covariant w.r.t. intensifications. For any semi-topological A-module M we define its dual Dual_{A} M := Hom_{A}^{cont}(M, K(A)). This duality operation has the remarkable property of respecting differential operators: given a continuous DO D : M --> N, there is a dual DO Dual_{A}(D) : Dual_{A} N --> Dual_{A} M. The results above are used (in a subsequent paper) to construct the Grothendieck residue complex K_{X}^{.} on any finite type k-scheme X, and to derive many of its properties.",1995-02-26T15:06:25Z,1995-02-26T15:06:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9502024v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/alg-geom/9502024v1,"alg-geom, math.AG"

As a by-product we obtain a homological interpretation of the Verlinde multiplicities as Euler characteristics of complexes built from invariant tensors of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.

The presence of other, equivalent, definitions of retracts provides several different methods of studying them, and brings together ideas from combinatorial algebra, homological algebra, and algebraic geometry. In this paper, we characterize all the retracts of $ K[x, y]$ up to an automorphism, and give several applications of this characterization, in particular, to the well-known Jacobian conjecture. Notably, we prove that if a polynomial mapping $\varphi$ of $K[x,y]$ has invertible Jacobian matrix {\it and } fixes a non-constant polynomial, then $\varphi$ is an automorphism.",1997-01-14T00:00:00Z,1997-01-14T00:00:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9701210v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9701210v1,"math.AC, math.AG, math.RA"
On the relation of Manin's quantum plane and quantum Clifford algebras,Bertfried Fauser,"One particular approach to quantum groups (matrix pseudo groups) provides the Manin quantum plane. Assuming an appropriate set of non-commuting variables spanning linearly a representation space one is able to show that the endomorphisms on that space preserving the non-commutative structure constitute a quantum group. The non-commutativity of these variables provide an example of non-commutative geometry.   In some recent work we have shown that quantum Clifford algebras --i.e. Clifford algebras of an arbitrary bilinear form-- are closely related to deformed structures as q-spin groups, Hecke algebras, q-Young operators and deformed tensor products. The natural question of relating Manin's approach to quantum Clifford algebras is addressed here.

The differentiable version of cyclic cohomology is associated to the algebra of transverse differential operators on that groupoid, which is shown to carry an intrinsic Hopf algebraic structure. We establish a canonical isomorphism between the periodic Hopf cyclic cohomology of this extended Hopf algebra and the Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology of the Lie algebra of formal vector fields. We then show that this isomorphism can be explicitly implemented at the cochain level, by a cochain map constructed out of a fixed torsion-free linear connection.

Deformation quantization of algebraic varieties,M. Kontsevich,"The paper is devoted to peculiarities of the deformation quantization in the algebro-geometric context. A direct application of the formality theorem to an algebraic Poisson manifold gives a canonical sheaf of categories deforming coherent sheaves. The global category is very degenerate in general. Thus, we introduce a new notion of a semi-formal deformation, a replacement in algebraic geometry of an actual deformation (versus a formal one). Deformed algebras obtained by semi-formal deformations are Noetherian and have polynomial growth.   We propose constructions of semi-formal quantizations of projective and affine algebraic Poisson manifolds satisfying certain natural geometric conditions.

The determination of the homotopy type of quaternionic algebraic cycles is more involved than in the real case, but has a similarly simple description. The stabilized space of quaternionic algebraic cycles admits a nontrivial infinite loop space structure yielding, in particular, a delooping of the total Pontrjagin class map. This stabilized space is directly related to an extended notion of quaternionic spaces and bundles (KH-theory), in analogy with Atiyah's real spaces and KR-theory, and the characteristic classes that we introduce for these objects are nontrivial. The paper ends with various examples and applications.",2005-07-21T20:26:48Z,2005-07-21T20:26:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507451v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0507451v1,"math.AT, math.AG, 14C25, 55P43, 14P99, 19L99, 55P47, 55P91"
Symmetries and invariants of twisted quantum algebras and associated   Poisson algebras,"A. I. Molev, E. Ragoucy","We construct an action of the braid group B_N on the twisted quantized enveloping algebra U'_q(o_N) where the elements of B_N act as automorphisms. In the classical limit q -> 1 we recover the action of B_N on the polynomial functions on the space of upper triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal. The action preserves the Poisson bracket on the space of polynomials which was introduced by Nelson and Regge in their study of quantum gravity and re-discovered in the mathematical literature. Furthermore, we construct a Poisson bracket on the space of polynomials associated with another twisted quantized enveloping algebra U'_q(sp_{2n}). We use the Casimir elements of both twisted quantized enveloping algebras to re-produce some well-known and construct some new polynomial invariants of the corresponding Poisson algebras.",2007-01-31T01:22:43Z,2007-04-01T04:21:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0701902v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0701902v3,"math.QA, math.DG, math.SG"

Already Cayley wrote about such algebras more than hundred years ago. Indeed, LSAs arise in many different areas of mathematics and physics. We attempt to give a survey of the fields where LSAs play an important role. Furthermore we study the algebraic theory of LSAs such as structure theory, radical theory, cohomology theory and the classification of simple LSAs.

"Affine Algebras, Langlands Duality and Bethe Ansatz",Edward Frenkel,"We review various aspects of representation theory of affine algebras at the critical level, geometric Langlands correspondence, and Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin models. Geometric Langlands correspondence relates D-modules on the moduli space of G-bundles on a complex curve X and flat G^L-bundles on X. Beilinson and Drinfeld construct it by applying a localization functor to representations of affine algebras of critical level. We show that in genus zero the corresponding D-modules are closely related to the diagonalization problem in the Gaudin model associated to G. This allows us to give a new interpretation of the Bethe ansatz and Sklyanin's separation of variables in the Gaudin model in terms of Langlands correspondence.",1995-06-05T19:10:06Z,1999-09-23T01:06:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9506003v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-alg/9506003v3,"q-alg, alg-geom, hep-th, math.AG, math.QA"

In fact, a more general statement is proven (""Formality conjecture""), relating the Lie superalgebra of polyvector fields on X and the Hochschild complex of the algebra of functions on X. Coefficients in explicit formulas for the deformed product can be interpreted as correlators in a topological open string theory, although I do not use explicitly the language of functional integrals.

The geometry of Markov traces,"Ben Webster, Geordie Williamson","We give a geometric interpretation of the Jones-Ocneanu trace on the Hecke algebra, using the equivariant cohomology of sheaves on SL(n). This construction makes sense for all simple algebraic groups, so we obtain a generalization of the Jones-Ocneanu trace to Hecke algebras of other types. We give a geometric expansion of this trace in terms of the irreducible characters of the Hecke algebra, and conclude that it agrees with a trace defined independently by Gomi.   Based on our proof, we also prove that certain simple perverse sheaves on a reductive algebraic group G are equivariantly formal for the conjugation action of a Borel B, or equivalently, that the Hochschild homology of any Soergel bimodule is free, as the authors had previously conjectured.   This construction is closely tied to knot homology.

Infeasibility certificates for linear matrix inequalities,"Igor Klep, Markus Schweighofer","Farkas' lemma is a fundamental result from linear programming providing linear certificates for infeasibility of systems of linear inequalities. In semidefinite programming, such linear certificates only exist for strongly infeasible linear matrix inequalities. We provide nonlinear algebraic certificates for all infeasible linear matrix inequalities in the spirit of real algebraic geometry. More precisely, we show that a linear matrix inequality is infeasible if and only if -1 lies in the quadratic module associated to it. We prove exponential degree bounds for the corresponding algebraic certificate. In order to get a polynomial size certificate, we use a more involved algebraic certificate motivated by the real radical and Prestel's theory of semiorderings.

Prime types and geometric completeness,Jean Berthet,"The geometric form of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz may be understood as a property of ""geometric saturation"" in algebraically closed fields. We conceptualise this property in the language of first order logic, following previous approaches and borrowing ideas from classical model theory, universal algebra and positive logic. This framework contains a logical equivalent of the algebraic theory of prime and radical ideals, as well as the basics of an ""affine algebraic geometry"" in quasivarieties. Hilbert's theorem may then be construed as a model-theoretical property, weaker than and equivalent in certain cases to positive model-completeness, and this enables us to geometrically reinterpret model-completeness itself.

Quantization of Drinfeld Zastava in type C,"Michael Finkelberg, Leonid Rybnikov","Drinfeld zastava is a certain closure of the moduli space of maps from the projective line to the Kashiwara flag scheme of an affine Lie algebra $\hat g$. In case $g$ is the symplectic Lie algebra $sp_N$, we introduce an affine, reduced, irreducible, normal quiver variety $Z$ which maps to the zastava space isomorphically in characteristic 0. The natural Poisson structure on the zastava space $Z$ can be described in terms of Hamiltonian reduction of a certain Poisson subvariety of the dual space of a (nonsemisimple) Lie algebra. The quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the corresponding quotient of its universal enveloping algebra produces a quantization $Y$ of the coordinate ring of $Z$. The same quantization was obtained in the finite (as opposed to the affine) case generically in arXiv:math/0409031 . We prove that $Y$ is a quotient of the affine Borel Yangian.

It is well known that if $A$ is cancellative, then $A$ and $Z$ are noetherian and $A$ is a finitely generated $Z$-module. Here we show the converse: if $A$ is non-cancellative (as almost all dimer algebras are), then $A$ and $Z$ are nonnoetherian and $A$ is an infinitely generated $Z$-module. Although $Z$ is nonnoetherian, we show that it nonetheless has Krull dimension 3 and is generically noetherian. Furthermore, we show that the reduced center is the coordinate ring for a Gorenstein algebraic variety with the strange property that it contains precisely one 'smeared-out' point of positive geometric dimension.

We focus on vacuum solutions to $d$ dimensional Einstein gravity. Each element in the phase space is a geometry with $SL(2,\mathbb R)\times U(1)^{d-3}$ isometries which has vanishing $SL(2,\mathbb R)$ and constant $U(1)$ charges. We construct an on-shell vanishing symplectic structure, which leads to an infinite set of symplectic symmetries. In four spacetime dimensions, the phase space is unique and the symmetry algebra consists of the familiar Virasoro algebra, while in $d>4$ dimensions the symmetry algebra, the NHEG algebra, contains infinitely many Virasoro subalgebras. The nontrivial central term of the algebra is proportional to the black hole entropy.

Earlier work of the authors classified the connected graded noetherian subalgebras of Sklyanin algebras using a noncommutative analogue of blowing up. In order to understand other algebras birational to a Sklyanin algebra, one also needs a notion of blowing down.   This is achieved in this paper, where we give a noncommutative analogue of Castelnuovo's classic theorem that (-1)-lines on a smooth surface can be contracted. The resulting noncommutative blown-down algebra has pleasant properties; in particular it is always noetherian and is smooth if the original noncommutative surface is smooth.

Namely, when the cohomology class of the symplectic form is integral, these Aoo-algebras are equivalent to the standard de Rham differential graded algebra on certain odd-dimensional sphere bundles over the symplectic manifold. From this equivalence, we deduce for a closed symplectic manifold that Tsai-Tseng-Yau's symplectic Aoo-algebras satisfy the Calabi-Yau property, and importantly, that they can be used to define an intersection theory for coisotropic/isotropic chains. We further demonstrate that these symplectic Aoo-algebras satisfy several functorial properties and lay the groundwork for addressing Weinstein functoriality and invariance in the smooth category.",2017-02-11T14:04:15Z,2017-02-11T14:04:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03423v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03423v1,"math.SG, math.AT, math.DG"

We see explicitly how it encompasses tropical algebraic theory and hyperfields.   Prime ground systems are introduced as a way of developing geometry. The polynomial system over a prime system is prime, and there is a weak Nullstellensatz. Also, the polynomial $\mathcal A[\la_1, \dots, \la_n]$ and Laurent polynomial systems $\mathcal A[[\la_1, \dots, \la_n]]$ in $n$ commuting indeterminates over a $\tT$-semiring-group system have dimension $n$.

Proof of the Gorenstein Interval Conjecture in low socle degree,"Sung Gi Park, Richard P.

Since an explicit characterization of which Hilbert functions are Gorenstein is widely believed to be hopeless, the GIC, if true, would at least provide the existence of a strong, and very natural, structural property for such basic functions in commutative algebra.

In addition, this new framework applies to any code benefiting from an error locating pair. Similarly to Pellikaan's and K\""otter's approach for unique algebraic decoding, our algorithm provides a unified point of view for decoding codes with an algebraic structure beyond the half minimum distance. It permits to get an abstract description of decoding using only codes and linear algebra and without involving the arithmetic of polynomial and rational function algebras used for the definition of the codes themselves.

"Demailly's notion of algebraic hyperbolicity: geometricity, boundedness,   moduli of maps","Ariyan Javanpeykar, Ljudmila Kamenova","Demailly's conjecture, which is a consequence of the Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture on varieties of general type, states that an algebraically hyperbolic complex projective variety is Kobayashi hyperbolic. Our aim is to provide evidence for Demailly's conjecture by verifying several predictions it makes. We first define what an algebraically hyperbolic projective variety is, extending Demailly's definition to (not necessarily smooth) projective varieties over an arbitrary algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and we prove that this property is stable under extensions of algebraically closed fields.

As an application, we obtain that Aut$(X)$ is finite and that every surjective endomorphism of $X$ is an automorphism.

"Graded algebras, projective spectra and blow-ups in derived algebraic   geometry",Jeroen Hekking,"We define graded, quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_S$-algebras over a given base derived scheme $S$, and show that these are equivalent to derived $\mathbb{G}_{m,S}$-schemes which are affine over $S$.

The theory of graded algebras and projective spectra is then used to define the blow-up of a closed immersion of derived schemes. Our construction will coincide with the existing one for the quasi-smooth case. The construction is done by generalizing the extended Rees algebra to the derived setting, using Weil restrictions.

Filtered deformations of elliptic algebras,Eric M. Rains,"One of the difficulties in doing noncommutative projective geometry via explicitly presented graded algebras is that it is usually quite difficult to show flatness, as the Hilbert series is uncomputable in general. If the algebra has a regular central element, one can reduce to understanding the (hopefully more tractable) quotient. If the quotient is particularly nice, one can proceed in reverse and find all algebras of which it is the quotient by a regular central element (the filtered deformations of the quotient). We consider in detail the case that the quotient is an elliptic algebra (the homogeneous endomorphism ring of a vector bundle on an elliptic curve, possibly twisted by translation). We explicitly compute the family of filtered deformations in many cases and give a (conjecturally exhaustive) construction of such deformations from noncommutative del Pezzo surfaces. In the process, we also give a number of results on the classification of exceptional collections on del Pezzo surfaces, which are new even in the commutative case.",2021-07-28T17:54:50Z,2022-02-17T17:52:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13540v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13540v2,"math.AG, math.QA"

This $L_\infty$ algebra governs the deformations of the Dirac--Jacobi structure: there is a one-to-one correspondence between the MC elements of this $L_\infty$ algebra and the small deformations of the Dirac-Jacobi structure. Further, by Cattaneo and Sch\""atz's equivalence of higher derived brackets, this $L_\infty$ algebra does not depend (up to $L_\infty$-isomorphisms) on the choice of the complementary almost Dirac--Jacobi structure. These same ideas apply to get a new proof of the independence of the $L_\infty$ algebra of Dirac structure from the choice of a complementary almost Dirac structure (a result proved using other techniques by Gualtieri, Matviichuk and Scott).",2021-11-14T22:50:38Z,2021-11-14T22:50:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07467v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07467v1,"math.DG, math.QA, math.SG, 53D10, 53D17, 58H15, 17B70, 58A50, 17B63"

In this paper, we study the effective Putinar's Positivestellensatz on a compact basic semi-algebraic set $S$ and provide a new proof and new improved bounds on the degree of the representation of positive polynomials. These new bounds involve a parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the non-vanishing of the positive function, the constant $\mathfrak{c}$ and exponent $L$ of a {\L}ojasiewicz inequality for the semi-algebraic distance function associated to the inequalities $\mathbf{g} = (g_1, \dots , g_r)$ defining $S$. They are polynomial in $\mathfrak{c}$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$ with an exponent depending only on $L$. We analyse in details the {\L}ojasiewicz inequality when the defining inequalities $\mathbf g$ satisfy the Constraint Qualification Condition.

The raw input data is a circle action on a unital $C^*$-algebra together with a quantum metric of spectral geometric origin on the fixed point algebra. Under a few extra conditions on the spectral subspaces we show that the spectral geometric data on the base algebra can be lifted to the total algebra. Notably, the lifted spectral geometry is independent of the choice of frames and is permitted to interact with the total algebra via a twisted derivation. Under these conditions, it is explained how to assemble our data into a quantum metric on the total algebra in a way which unifies and generalizes a couple of results in the literature relating to crossed products by the integers and to quantum $SU(2)$. We apply our ideas to the higher Vaksman-Soibelman quantum spheres and endow them with quantum metrics arising from $q$-geometric data. In this context, the twist is enforced by the structure of the Drinfeld-Jimbo deformation arising from the Lie algebra of the special unitary group.",2024-10-04T14:48:10Z,2024-10-04T14:48:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03475v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03475v1,"math.OA, math.FA, 58B34, 58B32"

We do so by starting with the toric ones (the q-symmetric algebras), and then deforming their relations using a diagrammatic calculus, proving unobstructedness of such deformations under suitable nondegeneracy conditions. We then prove that these algebras are identified with the canonical quantizations of corresponding families of quadratic Poisson structures, in the sense of Kontsevich. In this way, we obtain the first broad class of quadratic Poisson structures for which his quantization can be computed explicitly, and shown to converge, as he conjectured in 2001.",2024-11-15T18:44:58Z,2024-11-15T18:44:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10425v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10425v1,"math.QA, math.AG, math.RA, math.SG"
Holonomic Poisson geometry of Hilbert schemes,"Mykola Matviichuk, Brent Pym, Travis Schedler","We undertake a detailed study of the geometry of Bottacin's Poisson structures on Hilbert schemes of points in Poisson surfaces, i.e. smooth complex surfaces equipped with an effective anticanonical divisor. We focus on three themes that, while logically independent, are linked by the interplay between (characteristic) symplectic leaves and deformation theory. Firstly, we construct the symplectic groupoids of the Hilbert schemes and develop the classification of their symplectic leaves, using the methods of derived symplectic geometry. Secondly, we establish local normal forms for the Poisson brackets, and combine them with a toric degeneration argument to verify that Hilbert schemes satisfy our recent conjecture characterizing holonomic Poisson manifolds in terms of the geometry of the modular vector field. Finally, using constructible sheaf methods, we compute the space of first-order Poisson deformations when the anti-canonical divisor is reduced and has only quasi-homogeneous singularities. (The latter is automatic if the surface is projective.) Along the way, we find a tight connection between the Poisson geometry of the Hilbert schemes and the finite-dimensional Lie algebras of affine transformations, which is mediated by syzygies. In particular, we find that the Hilbert scheme has a natural subvariety that serves as a global counterpart of the nilpotent cone, and we prove that the Lie algebras of affine transformations have holonomic dual spaces -- the first such series of Lie algebras to be discovered.",2022-12-30T15:13:54Z,2022-12-30T15:13:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14763v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14763v1,"math.AG, math.SG, 53D17 (Primary) 14C05, 14B12, 14A30 (Secondary)"

They imply immediately the corresponding properties of quantum K-invariants. The derived approach produces highly intuitive statements and functorial proofs. The flexibility of our derived approach to quantum K-invariants allows us to impose not only simple incidence conditions for marked points, but also incidence conditions with multiplicities. This leads to a new set of enumerative invariants.

The elementary fields necessary for the construction of quantum geometry are introduced and classified. A complete Krein-Fock space structure for elementary fields is presented using field operator algebras. We conclude that since quantum de Sitter geometry can be constructed by elementary field operators, the geometry quantum state is immersed in the Krein-Fock space and evolves in it. The total number of accessible quantum states in the universe is chosen as a parameter of quantum state evolution, which has a relationship with the universe's entropy.

Representations of the Renormalization Group as Matrix Lie Algebra,"M. Berg, P. Cartier","Renormalization is cast in the form of a Lie algebra of infinite triangular matrices. By exponentiation, these matrices generate counterterms for Feynman diagrams with subdivergences.

In fact, the right-symmetric nonassociative algebra of the Connes-Kreimer insertion product is equivalent to an ""Ihara bracket"" in the matrix Lie algebra. We check our results in a three-loop example in scalar field theory.

A key role is played by the sextonions, a six dimensional algebra between the quaternions and octonions.

Canonical surfaces in P^4 and Gorenstein algebras in codimension 2,Christian Böhning,"In this paper I investigate minimal surfaces of general type with p_g=5, q=0 for which the 1-canonical map is a birational morphism onto a surface in P^4 (so called canonical surfaces in P^4) via a structure theorem for the Hilbert resolutions of the canonical rings of the afore-mentioned surfaces, viewed as Gorenstein algebras of codimension 2 over the homogeneous coordinate ring of P^4. I discuss how the ring structure of such an algebra is encoded in its resolution. Among other things I show how this method can be applied to analyze the moduli space of canonical surfaces with p_g=5, q=0, K^2=11, thus recovering a result previously obtained by D.

On the $K$-theory of $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$,"Benjamin Antieau, Achim Krause, Thomas Nikolaus","We give an explicit algebraic description, based on prismatic cohomology, of the algebraic K-groups of rings of the form $O_K/I$ where $K$ is a p-adic field and $I$ is a non-trivial ideal in the ring of integers $O_K$; this class includes the rings $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$ where $p$ is a prime.   The algebraic description allows us to describe a practical algorithm to compute individual K-groups as well as to obtain several theoretical results: the vanishing of the even K-groups in high degrees, the determination of the orders of the odd K-groups in high degrees, and the degree of nilpotence of $v_1$ acting on the mod $p$ syntomic cohomology of $\mathbf{Z}/p^n$.",2024-05-07T13:57:23Z,2024-05-07T13:57:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04329v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04329v1,"math.KT, math.AG, math.AT"
Ultrasolid Homotopical Algebra,Sofía Marlasca Aparicio,"Solid modules over $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$, introduced by Clausen and Scholze, are a well-behaved variant of complete topological vector spaces that forms a symmetric monoidal Grothendieck abelian category.

In this work, we establish an upper bound and a lower bound of the minimal dimension $N$ such that there exists an algebraically skew embedding into $\mathbb{P}^N$ in terms of the dimension of the given smooth variety $X$.

Homotopical Algebraic Geometry II: geometric stacks and applications,"Bertrand Toen, Gabriele Vezzosi","This is the second part of a series of papers devoted to develop Homotopical Algebraic Geometry. We start by defining and studying generalizations of standard notions of linear and commutative algebra in an abstract monoidal model category, such as derivations, etale and smooth maps, flat and projective modules, etc. We then use the theory of stacks over model categories introduced in \cite{hagI} in order to define a general notion of geometric stack over a base symmetric monoidal model category C, and prove that this notion satisfies the expected properties. The rest of the paper consists in specializing C to several different contexts. First of all, when C=k-Mod is the category of modules over a ring k, with the trivial model structure, we show that our notion gives back the algebraic n-stacks of C. Simpson. Then we set C=sk-Mod, the model category of simplicial k-modules, and obtain this way a notion of geometric derived stacks which are the main geometric objects of Derived Algebraic Geometry. We give several examples of derived version of classical moduli stacks, as for example the derived stack of local systems on a space, of algebra structures over an operad, of flat bundles on a projective complex manifold, etc. Finally, we present the cases where C=(k) is the model category of unbounded complexes of modules over a char 0 ring k, and C=Sp^{\Sigma} the model category of symmetric spectra. In these two contexts, called respectively Complicial and Brave New Algebraic Geometry, we give some examples of geometric stacks such as the stack of associative dg-algebras, the stack of dg-categories, and a geometric stack constructed using topological modular forms.",2004-04-21T00:18:09Z,2006-03-14T10:44:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0404373v7,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404373v7,"math.AG, math.AT, 14A20; 14D15; 14D20; 14F20; 14F35"
Differential galois theory and mechanics,Jean-François Pommaret,"The classical Galois theory deals with certain finite algebraic extensions and establishes a bijective order reversing correspondence between the intermediate fields and the subgroups of a group of permutations called the Galois group of the extension. It has been the dream of many mathematicians at the end of the nineteenth century to generalize these results to systems of algebraic partial differential (PD) equations and the corresponding finitely generated differential extensions, in order to be able to add the word differential in front of any classical statement. The achievement of the Picard-Vessiot theory by E. Kolchin between 1950 and 1970 is now well known. The purpose of this paper is to sketch the general theory for such differential extensions and algebraic pseudogroups by means of new methods mixing differential algebra, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. As already discovered by E. Vessiot in 1904 through the use of automorphic systems, a concept never acknowledged, the main point is to notice that the Galois theory (old and new) is mainly a study of principal homogeneous spaces (PHS) for algebraic groups or pseudogroups. Hence, all the formal theory of PD equations developped by D.C. Spencer around 1970 must be used together with modern algebraic geometry, in particular tensor products of rings and fields. However, the combination of these new tools is not sufficient and we have to create the analogue for Lie pseudogroups of the so-called invariant derivations introduced by A. Bialynicki-Birula after 1960 in the study of algebraic groups and fields with derivations. We shall finally prove the usefulness of the resulting differential Galois theory through striking applications to mechanics, revisiting shell theory, chain theory, the Frenet-Serret formulas and the integration of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.",2017-10-23T07:37:16Z,2017-10-23T07:37:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08122v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08122v1,"math.DG, math.AG, math.GR, physics.class-ph"

We prove that every Poisson nilpotent algebra satisfying a mild condition on certain scalars is canonically isomorphic to a cluster algebra which coincides with the corresponding upper cluster algebra, without additional localizations by frozen variables. The constructed cluster structure is compatible with the Poisson structure in the sense of Gekhtman, Shapiro and Vainshtein. All Poisson nilpotent algebras are proved to be equivariant Poisson Unique Factorization Domains.

These algebras are mostly important due to their relations to Schubert calculus and geometry and to the general framework of quantum groups and Nichols algebras. Fomin and Kirillov asked about the dimension of $\mathcal{E}_m$. In this paper, we prove that $\mathcal{E}_m$ is infinite dimensional for all $m\geq 6$ which was a well-known conjecture.

Separable algebras and coflasque resolutions,"Matthew R. Ballard, Alexander Duncan, Alicia Lamarche, Patrick K.

The most famous example is the deep connection between Severi-Brauer varieties and central simple algebras. For more general varieties, one might use endomorphism algebras of line bundles, of indecomposable vector bundles, or of exceptional objects in their derived categories.   Using Galois cohomology, we describe a new invariant of reductive algebraic groups that captures precisely when this strategy will fail. Our main result characterizes this invariant in terms of coflasque resolutions of linear algebraic groups introduced by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene.

By extension, the functors of points for any $p$-adic affine commutative group scheme and for any formal group are defined on, and only depend on, $p$-polar structures. In terms of abelian Hopf algebras, we show that a cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra can be defined on any $p$-polar $k$-algebra $P$, and it agrees with the cofree commutative Hopf algebra on a commutative $k$-algebra $A$ if $P$ is the $p$-polar algebra underlying $A$; a dual result holds for free commutative Hopf algebras on finite $k$-coalgebras.",2020-12-18T12:37:30Z,2021-10-27T08:03:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10196v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10196v3,"math.AT, math.AG, math.RA, 14L05, 14L15, 14L17, 13A99, 13A35, 16T05"
3-dimensional $Λ$-BMS Symmetry and its Deformations,"A. Borowiec, J. Kowalski-Glikman, J.

Building on previous results in the finite dimensional subalgebras we classify all possible Lie bialgebra structures and for selected examples, we explicitly construct the related Hopf algebras. Using cohomological arguments we show that this construction can always be performed by a so-called twist deformation. The resulting structures can be compared to the well-known $\kappa$-Poincar\'e Hopf algebras constructed on the finite dimensional Poincar\'e or (anti) de Sitter algebra. The dual $\kappa$ Minkowski spacetime is supposed to describe a specific non-commutative geometry. Importantly, we find that some incarnations of the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e can not be extended consistently to the infinite dimensional algebras. Furthermore, certain deformations can have potential physical applications if subalgebras are considered. Since the conserved charges associated with asymptotic symmetries in 3-dimensional form a centrally extended algebra we also discuss briefly deformations of such algebras. The presence of the full symmetry algebra might have observable consequences that could be used to rule out these deformations. }",2021-06-24T10:15:59Z,2021-11-11T14:59:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12874v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12874v2,"hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"

If an algebra $A$ is Artinian, such pairing exists if and only if $A$ is Gorenstein. We give a description of algebras with Gorenstein duality as a quotients of the ring of differential operators by the annihilator of an explicit polynomial (or more generally formal polynomial series).

On bases of quantum affine algebras,"Jie Xiao, Han Xu, Minghui Zhao","Let $\textbf{U}^+$ be the positive part of the quantum group $\textbf{U}$ associated with a generalized Cartan matrix. In the case of finite type, Lusztig constructed the canonical basis $\textbf{B}$ of $\textbf{U}^+$ via two approaches. The first one is an elementary algebraic construction via Ringel-Hall algebra realization of $\textbf{U}^+$ and the second one is a geometric construction. The geometric construction of canonical basis can be generalized to the cases of all types. The generalization of the elementary algebraic construction to affine type is an important problem. We give several main results of algebraic constructions to the affine canonical basis in this ariticle.

On morphisms between connected commutative algebraic groups over a field   of characteristic $0$,Gabriel Andreas Dill,"Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and let $G$ and $H$ be connected commutative algebraic groups over $K$. Let $\text{Mor}_0(G,H)$ denote the set of morphisms of algebraic varieties $G \to H$ that map the neutral element to the neutral element. We construct a natural retraction from $\text{Mor}_0(G,H)$ to $\text{Hom}(G,H)$ (for arbitrary $G$ and $H$) which commutes with the composition and addition of morphisms. In particular, if $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic as algebraic varieties, then they are isomorphic as algebraic groups. If $G$ has no non-trivial unipotent group as a direct factor, we give an explicit description of the sets of all morphisms and isomorphisms of algebraic varieties between $G$ and $H$. We also characterize all connected commutative algebraic groups over $K$ whose only variety automorphisms are compositions of automorphisms of algebraic groups with translations.",2021-07-30T14:36:25Z,2022-05-25T00:20:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14667v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14667v3,"math.AG, 14L10, 14L40"

Via the same techniques, we determine the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of representations of the $\mu$-deformed preprojective algebra introduced by Crawley-Boevey and Holland, for all dimension vectors.

The finite dual coalgebra as a quantization of the maximal spectrum,Manuel L. Reyes,"In pursuit of a noncommutative spectrum functor, we argue that the Heyneman-Sweedler finite dual coalgebra can be viewed as a quantization of the maximal spectrum of a commutative affine algebra, integrating prior perspectives of Takeuchi, Batchelor, Kontsevich-Soibelman, and Le Bruyn. We introduce fully residually finite-dimensional algebras $A$ as those with enough finite-dimensional representations to let $A^\circ$ act as an appropriate depiction of the noncommutative maximal spectrum of $A$; importantly, this class includes affine noetherian PI algebras. In the case of prime affine algebras that are module-finite over their center, we describe how the Azumaya locus is represented in the finite dual. This is used to describe the finite dual of quantum planes at roots of unity as an endeavor to visualize the noncommutative space on which these algebras act as functions. Finally, we discuss how a similar analysis can be carried out for other maximal orders over surfaces.",2021-11-13T09:57:51Z,2024-01-26T22:58:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07081v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07081v4,"math.RA, math.AG, math.CT, math.QA, 14A22, 16B50, 16T15 (Primary), 16G30, 16P40, 16R20, 16S80

Koszul algebras and Donaldson-Thomas invariants,"Vladimir Dotsenko, Evgeny Feigin, Markus Reineke","For a given symmetric quiver $Q$, we define a supercommutative quadratic algebra $\mathcal{A}_Q$ whose Poincar\'e series is related to the motivic generating function of $Q$ by a simple change of variables. The Koszul duality between supercommutative algebras and Lie superalgebras assigns to the algebra $\mathcal{A}_Q$ its Koszul dual Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}_Q$. We prove that the motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the quiver $Q$ may be computed using the Poincar\'e series of a certain Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}_Q$ that can be described, using an action of the first Weyl algebra on $\mathfrak{g}_Q$, as the kernel of the operator $\partial_t$. This gives a new proof of positivity for motivic Donaldson--Thomas invariants.

The input consists of a complex reductive group G (possibly disconnected) and a cuspidal local system on a nilpotent orbit for a Levi subgroup of G. We prove that every such ""geometric"" graded Hecke algebra is naturally isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a certain G x C*-equivariant semisimple complex of sheaves on the nilpotent cone $g_N$.   From there we provide an algebraic description of the G x C*-equivariant bounded derived category of constructible sheaves on $g_N$.

Principles of operator algebras,Teo Banica,"This is an introduction to the algebras $A\subset B(H)$ that the linear operators $T:H\to H$ can form, once a complex Hilbert space $H$ is given. Motivated by quantum mechanics, we are mainly interested in the von Neumann algebras, which are stable under taking adjoints, $T\to T^*$, and are weakly closed. When the algebra has a trace $tr:A\to\mathbb C$, we can think of it as being of the form $A=L^\infty(X)$, with $X$ being a quantum measured space. Of particular interest is the free case, where the center of the algebra reduces to the scalars, $Z(A)=\mathbb C$. Following von Neumann, Connes, Jones, Voiculescu and others, we discuss the basic properties of such algebras $A$, and how to do algebra, geometry, analysis and probability on the underlying quantum spaces $X$.",2022-08-07T00:07:20Z,2024-08-13T16:55:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03600v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03600v5,"math.OA, math-ph, math.FA, math.MP, math.QA"

In the process we define a new, larger algebra $\widetilde{A}$, which seems to be ``dual'' to the Fomin-Kirillov algebra, and in low ranks is linearly isomorphic to it. There is also a mysterious connection between $\widetilde{A}$ and the Orlik-Solomon algebra, in analogy with the fact that the Fomin-Kirillov algebra contains the coinvariant algebra of $W$. This analysis is applied to compute the multiplicities $\langle \rho, H^k(F,\mathbb{C})\rangle_W$ and $\langle \rho, H^k(M,\mathbb{C})\rangle_W$, where $M$ and $F$ are respectively the hyperplane complement and Milnor fibre associated to $W$ and $\rho$ is a representation of $W$.",2022-10-21T00:11:22Z,2022-10-21T00:11:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11645v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11645v1,"math.RT, math.AG, math.RA, 20F55, 52C35, 32S55"

CoHA of Cyclic Quivers and an Integral Form of Affine Yangians,Shivang Jindal,"We calculate the deformed and non-deformed cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra for the case of cyclic quivers by studying the Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHA and using tools from cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of matrix differential operators on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives a positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian $\ddot{\mathcal{Y}}_{\hbar_1,\hbar_2}(\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem of Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), this also determines the positive half of the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic quivers. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the strong rationality conjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any quiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported semistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the additive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver.

Beauville-Laszlo gluing of algebraic spaces,"Piotr Achinger, Alex Youcis","For a complete discrete valuation field $K$, we show that one may always glue a separated formal algebraic space $\mathfrak{X}$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$ to a separated algebraic space $U$ over $K$ along an open immersion of rigid spaces $j\colon \mathfrak{X}^{\rm rig}\to U^{\rm an}$, producing a separated algebraic space $X$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$. This process gives rise to an equivalence between such `gluing triples' $(U,\mathfrak{X},j)$ and separated algebraic spaces $X$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$, which one might interpret as a version of the Beauville--Laszlo theorem for algebraic spaces rather than coherent sheaves. Moreover, an analogous equivalence exists over any excellent base. Examples due to Matsumoto imply that the result of such a gluing might be a genuine algebraic space (not a scheme) even if $U$ and the special fiber of $\mathfrak{X}$ are projective. The proof is a combination of Nagata compactification theorem for algebraic spaces and of Artin's contraction theorem.

Mather-Yau's type theorem for higher Nash blowup algebras,Hong Duc Nguyen,"In this paper, we establish a Mather-Yau theorem for higher Nash blowup algebras, demonstrating that the isomorphism type of the local ring of any hypersurface singularity, defined over an arbitrary field, is fully determined by its higher Nash blowup algebras. The classical Mather-Yau theorem (1982) asserts that for isolated complex hypersurface singularities, the isomorphism type of the local ring is determined by the Tjurina algebra. In positive characteristic, this result was extended by considering the higher Tjurina algebras by Greuel and Pham (2017) under the assumptions of an algebraically closed ground field and isolated singularities. Our work begins by proving the stability of higher Nash blowup algebras under contact equivalence in a very general framework. Specifically, we show that the higher Nash blowup algebras of any system of elements in an analytic or geometric ring remain invariant under contact equivalence. For complex hypersurface singularities, this stability was conjectured by Hussain, Ma, Yau, and Zuo, and was recently verified by Le and Yasuda.

The Projective Geometry of the Gale Transform,"David Eisenbud, Sorin Popescu","The Gale transform, an involution on sets of points in projective space, appears in a multitude of guises, in subjects as diverse as optimization, coding theory, theta-functions, and recently in our proof that certain general sets of points fail to satisfy the minimal free resolution conjecture. In this paper we reexamine the Gale transform in the light of modern algebraic geometry. We give a more general definition, in the context of finite (locally) Gorenstein subschemes. We put in modern form a number of the more remarkable examples discovered in the past, and we add new constructions and connections to other areas of algebraic geometry. We generalize Goppa's theorem in coding theory and we give new applications to Castelnuovo theory.

Kustin--Miller unprojection without complexes,"Stavros Papadakis, Miles Reid","Gorenstein projection plays a key role in birational geometry; the typical example is the linear projection of a del Pezzo surface of degree d to one of degree d-1, but variations on the same idea provide many of the classical and modern birational links between Fano 3-folds. The inverse operation is the Kustin--Miller unprojection theorem (A. Kustin and M. Miller, Constructing big Gorenstein ideals from small ones, J. Algebra 85 (1983) 303--322), which constructs ""more complicated"" Gorenstein rings starting from ""less complicated"" ones (increasing the codimension by 1). We give a clean statement and proof of their theorem, using the adjunction formula for the dualising sheaf in place of their complexes and Buchsbaum--Eisenbud exactness criterion. Our methods are scheme theoretic and work without any mention of the ambient space. They are thus not restricted to the local situation, and are well adapted to generalisations.

Strictly speaking, the functor $F$ is only representable by an algebraic space, but we show that $F$ is representable by a scheme after an etale base change.

"Lehmer's Problem, McKay's Correspondence, and $2,3,7$",Eriko Hironaka,"This paper addresses a long standing open problem due to Lehmer in which the triple 2,3,7 plays a notable role. Lehmer's problem asks whether there is a gap between 1 and the next smallest algebraic integer with respect to Mahler measure. The question has been studied in a wide range of contexts including number theory, ergodic theory, hyperbolic geometry, and knot theory; and relates to basic questions such as describing the distribution of heights of algebraic integers, and of lengths of geodesics on arithmetic surfaces. This paper focuses on the role of Coxeter systems in Lehmer's problem.

Algebraic approach to quantum gravity III: noncommmutative Riemannian   geometry,S. Majid,"This is a self-contained introduction to quantum Riemannian geometry based on quantum groups as frame groups, and its proposed role in quantum gravity. Much of the article is about the generalisation of classical Riemannian geometry that arises naturally as the classical limit; a theory with nonsymmetric metric and a skew version of metric compatibilty. Meanwhile, in quantum gravity a key ingredient of our approach is the proposal that the differential structure of spacetime is something that itself must be summed over or `quantised' as a physical degree of freedom. We illustrate such a scheme for quantum gravity on small finite sets.",2006-04-19T12:05:05Z,2006-04-19T12:05:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0604132v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0604132v1,"hep-th, gr-qc, math.QA"
Orthogonal nets and Clifford algebras,"Alexander I. Bobenko, Udo J. Hertrich-Jeromin","A Clifford algebra model for M""obius geometry is presented. The notion of Ribaucour pairs of orthogonal systems in arbitrary dimensions is introduced, and the structure equations for adapted frames are derived. These equations are discretized and the geometry of the occuring discrete nets and sphere congruences is discussed in a conformal setting. This way, the notions of ``discrete Ribaucour congruences'' and ``discrete Ribaucour pairs of orthogonal systems'' are obtained --- the latter as a generalization of discrete orthogonal systems in Euclidean space. The relation of a Cauchy problem for discrete orthogonal nets and a permutability theorem for the Ribaucour transformation of smooth orthogonal systems is discussed.",1998-02-27T21:56:12Z,1998-02-27T21:56:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9802126v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9802126v1,math.DG

New topological recursion relations,"Xiaobo Liu, Rahul Pandharipande","Simple boundary expressions for the k-th power of the cotangent line class on the moduli space of stable 1-pointed genus g curves are found for k >= 2g.

As a consequence, nontrivial tautological classes in the kernel of the push-forward map associated to the irreducible boundary divisor of the moduli space of stable g+1 curves are constructed. The geometry of genus g+1 curves then provides universal equations in genus g Gromov-Witten theory. As an application, we prove all the Gromov-Witten identities conjectured recently by K. Liu and H.

On the Statistics of Lattice Polytopes,Maximilian Kreuzer,We use the notions of reflexivity and of reflexive dimensions in order to introduce probability measures for lattice polytopes and initiate the investigation of their statistical properties. Examples of applications to discrete geometry include a study of randomness of self-duality of reflexive polytopes and implications for expectation values of the numbers of such polytopes in higher dimensions. We also discuss enumeration problems and related algorithms and point out interesting open problems. In this context we define the notion of IP-confined polytopes.

As a corollary we show that the cross-ratio of the exponents of the solid angles of a tetrahedron is equal to the cross-ratio of the exponents of the perimeters of its faces. The Regge symmetries of a tetrahedron are related to the action of the Weyl group $W(D_6)$ on the Picard lattice of the corresponding surface.,2019-08-03T10:00:58Z,2021-06-06T12:54:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01141v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01141v2,"math.AG, math.MG"

Deformations of Quasicoherent Sheaves of Algebras,Valery A. Lunts,"Gerstenhaber and Schack ([GS]) developed a deformation theory of presheaves of algebras on small categories. We translate their cohomological description to sheaf cohomology. More precisely, we describe the deformation space of (admissible) quasicoherent sheaves of algebras on a quasiprojective scheme $X$ in terms of sheaf cohomology on $X$ and $X\times X$. These results are applied to the study of deformations of the sheaf $D_X$ of differential operators on $X$. In particular, in case $X$ is a flag variety we show that any deformation of $D_X$, which is induced by a deformation of $\cO_X$, must be trivial.

Poisson Hierarchy of Discrete Strings,"Theodora Ioannidou, Antti Niemi","The Poisson geometry of a discrete string in three dimensional Euclidean space is investigated.

The construction is then generalised, in a self-similar manner, into an infinite hierarchy of Poisson algebras.

Twisted divided powers and applications,"Michel Gros, Bernard Le Stum, Adolfo Quirós","In order to give a formal treatment of differential equations in positive characteristic p, it is necessary to use divided powers.

We introduce here a notion of twisted divided powers (relative to q) and show that one can recover the twisted Weyl algebra and obtain a twisted p-curvature map that describes the center of the twisted Weyl algebra. We also build a divided p-Frobenius that will give, by duality, a formal Azumaya splitting of the twisted Weyl algebra as well as a twisted Simpson correspondence.",2017-11-06T14:41:27Z,2017-11-06T14:41:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01907v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01907v1,math.AG

Real solutions to equations from geometry,Frank Sottile,"Understanding, finding, or even deciding on the existence of real solutions to a system of equations is a very difficult problem with many applications. While it is hopeless to expect much in general, we know a surprising amount about these questions for systems which possess additional structure. Particularly fruitful--both for information on real solutions and for applicability--are systems whose additional structure comes from geometry. Such equations from geometry for which we have information about their real solutions are the subject of these lecture notes, which focuses on bounds, both upper and lower, as well as situations in which all solutions can be real.",2006-09-29T01:49:58Z,2010-03-01T17:01:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0609829v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0609829v2,"math.AG, 12D10; 14P99"

In this paper we consider the case where M is a Fano manifold; this implies that L is ample. If g is a simple Lie algebra, the unique closed orbit in P(g) (for the adjoint action) is a Fano contact manifold; it is conjectured that every Fano contact manifold is obtained in this way. A positive answer would imply an analogous result for compact quaternion-Kahler manifolds with positive scalar curvature, a longstanding question in Riemannian geometry. In this paper we solve the conjecture under the additional assumptions that the group of contact automorphisms of M is reductive, and that the image of the rational map M - - -> P(H0(M,L)*) associated to L has maximum dimension.

Its unitary representations correspond to Riemannian metrics and Spin structure while $ds$ is the Dirac propagator $ds = \ts \!\!$---$\!\! \ts = D^{-1}$ where $D$ is the Dirac operator. We extend these simple relations to the non commutative case using Tomita's involution $J$. We then write a spectral action, the trace of a function of the length element in Planck units, which when applied to the non commutative geometry of the Standard Model will be shown (in a joint work with Ali Chamseddine) to give the SM Lagrangian coupled to gravity. The internal fluctuations of the non commutative geometry are trivial in the commutative case but yield the full bosonic sector of SM with all correct quantum numbers in the slightly non commutative case.

We consider two examples: a toroidal orbifold T^6/Z_2 x Z_2, and an orbifold of the quintic in CP_4, each with discrete torsion. The non-commutative geometry tools are enough to describe various properties of the orbifolds. First, one describes correctly the fractionation of branes at singularities. Secondly, for the first example we show that one can recover explicitly a large slice of the moduli space of complex structures which deform the orbifold. For this example we also show that we get the correct counting of complex structure deformations at the orbifold point by using traces of non-commutative differential forms (cyclic homology).",2000-09-26T22:12:05Z,2000-11-24T21:13:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0009209v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0009209v2,"hep-th, math.AG"

We prove that the compatibility conditions reduce to an algebraic equation, which represents a considerable simplification with respect to the general case.

Two main results are (1) a procedure for calculating constraints which the flux parameters must satisfy in these models if any given type of vacuum is to exist; (2) a stepwise process for finding all of the isolated vacua of such systems and their physical properties.

This is used to show that the de Rham algebra of M is weakly equivalent to its subquotient $(H^*_c(M), d)$, called {\bf the pseudocohomology} of M. When M is compact and Kaehler and \omega is its Kaehler form, $(H^*_c(M), d)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology algebra of M. This gives another proof of homotopy formality for Kaehler manifolds, originally shown by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan and Sullivan. We compute $H^i_c(M)$ for a compact G_2-manifold, showing that it is isomorphic to cohomology unless i=3,4.

We show that the same is true for the Artinian reduction of reduced, level sets of points in projective 3-space. Our main goal is to begin an understanding of how the geometry of a set of points can prevent its Artinian reduction from having WLP, which in itself is a very algebraic notion. More precisely, we produce level sets of points whose Artinian reductions have socle types 3 and 4 and arbitrary socle degree $\geq 12$ (in the worst case), but fail to have WLP. We also produce a level set of points whose Artinian reduction fails to have unimodal Hilbert function; our example is based on Zanello's example.

Localization of $\frak{u}$-modules. II. Configuration spaces and quantum   groups,"M. Finkelberg, V. Schechtman","This paper is a sequel to ""Localization of $\frak{u}$-modules. I"", hep-th/9411050. We are starting here the geometric study of the tensor category $\cal{C}$ associated with a quantum group (corresponding to a Cartan matrix of finite type) at a root of unity. The main results establish isomorphisms between homogeneous components of irreducible objects in $\cal{C}$ and spaces of vanishing cycles at the origin of certain Goresky-MacPherson sheaves on configuration spaces; establish isomorphisms of the stalks at the origin of the above GM sheaves with certain Hochschild complexes (which compute the Hochschild homology of a certain ""triangular"" subalgebra of our quantum group with coefficients in the coresponding irreducible representation); establish the analogous results for tensor products of irreducibles. In geometry, the tensor product of representations corresponds to a ""fusion"" of sheaves on configuration spaces --- operation defined using the functor of nearby cycles.",1995-01-01T00:13:47Z,1995-01-22T00:17:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9412017v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-alg/9412017v4,"q-alg, alg-geom, math.AG, math.QA"
Algebraic geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks,Seth Sullivant,"Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables. This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models. Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.",2007-04-06T19:14:52Z,2007-05-22T19:52:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0918v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0918v2,"math.AG, math.ST, stat.TH"
New Approach to Arakelov Geometry,Nikolai Durov,"This work is dedicated to a new completely algebraic approach to Arakelov geometry, which doesn't require the variety under consideration to be generically smooth or projective. In order to construct such an approach we develop a theory of generalized rings and schemes, which include classical rings and schemes together with ""exotic"" objects such as F_1 (""field with one element""), Z_\infty (""real integers""), T (tropical numbers) etc., thus providing a systematic way of studying such objects.   This theory of generalized rings and schemes is developed up to construction of algebraic K-theory, intersection theory and Chern classes. Then existence of Arakelov models of algebraic varieties over Q is shown, and our general results are applied to such models.",2007-04-16T17:38:22Z,2007-04-16T17:38:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2030v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2030v1,"math.AG, math.NT, 14G40 (Primary), 14A20, 18G55, 08A40 (Secondary)"
Loop Spaces and Langlands Parameters,"David Ben-Zvi, David Nadler","We apply the technique of S^1-equivariant localization to sheaves on loop spaces in derived algebraic geometry, and obtain a fundamental link between two families of categories at the heart of geometric representation theory. Namely, we categorify the well known relationship between free loop spaces, cyclic homology and de Rham cohomology to recover the category of D-modules on a smooth stack X as a localization of the category of S^1-equivariant coherent sheaves on its loop space LX. The main observation is that this procedure connects categories of equivariant D-modules on flag varieties with categories of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Steinberg variety and its relatives. This provides a direct connection between the geometry of finite and affine Hecke algebras and braid groups, and a uniform geometric construction of all of the categorical parameters for representations of real and complex reductive groups. This paper forms the first step in a project to apply the geometric Langlands program to the complex and real local Langlands programs, which we describe.",2007-06-03T14:41:46Z,2007-06-03T14:41:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0322v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0322v1,"math.RT, math.AG, math.QA"
CW-complex Nagata Idealizations,"Armando Capasso, Pietro De Poi, Giovanna Ilardi","We introduce a novel construction which allows us to identify the elements of the skeletons of a CW-complex $P(m)$ and the monomials in $m$ variables. From this, we infer that there is a bijection between finite CW-subcomplexes of $P(m)$, which are quotients of finite simplicial complexes, and some bigraded standard Artinian Gorenstein algebras, generalizing previous constructions in \cite{F:S}, \cite{CGIM} and \cite{G:Z}.   We apply this to a generalization of Nagata idealization for level algebras. These algebras are standard graded Artinian algebras whose Macaulay dual generator is given explicitly as a bigraded polynomial of bidegree $(1,d)$. We consider the algebra associated to polynomials of the same type of bidegree $(d_1,d_2)$.",2020-05-04T14:07:01Z,2020-06-26T14:08:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01501v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01501v2,"math.AC, math.AG, Primary 13A30, 05E40, Secondary 57Q05, 13D40, 13A02, 13E10"
Cohomology of algebraic varieties over non-archimedean fields,"Pablo Cubides Kovacsics, Mário Edmundo, Jinhe Ye","We develop a sheaf cohomology theory of algebraic varieties over an algebraically closed non-trivially valued non-archimedean field $K$ based on Hrushovski-Loeser's stable completion. In parallel, we develop a sheaf cohomology of definable subsets in o-minimal expansions of the tropical semi-group $\Gamma_\infty$, where $\Gamma$ denotes the value group of $K$. For quasi-projective varieties, both cohomologies are strongly related by a deformation retraction of the stable completion homeomorphic to a definable subset of $\Gamma_\infty$. In both contexts, we show that the corresponding cohomology theory satisfies the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, finiteness and invariance, and we provide natural bounds of cohomological dimension in each case. As an application, we show that there are finitely many isomorphism types of cohomology groups in definable families. Moreover, due to the strong relation between the stable completion of an algebraic variety and its analytification in the sense of V. Berkovich, we recover and extend results on the topological cohomology of the analytification of algebraic varieties concerning finiteness and invariance.",2020-05-22T15:07:04Z,2021-04-14T16:41:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11229v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11229v3,"math.AG, math.AT, math.LO, Primary 55N30, 12J25, 03C98, 03C64 Secondary 14G22, 14T05"
"Periods, Power Series, and Integrated Algebraic Numbers",Tobias Kaiser,Periods are defined as integrals of semialgebraic functions defined over the rationals. Periods form a countable ring not much is known about. Examples are given by taking the antiderivative of a power series which is algebraic over the polynomial ring over the rationals and evaluate it at a rational number. We follow this path and close these algebraic power series under taking iterated antiderivatives and nearby algebraic and geometric operations. We obtain a system of rings of power series whose coefficients form a countable real closed field. Using techniques from o-minimality we are able to show that every period belongs to this field. In the setting of o-minimality we define exponential integrated algebraic numbers and show that the Euler constant is an exponential integrated algebraic number. Hence they are a good candiate for a natural number system extending the period ring and containing important mathematical constants.,2022-11-02T16:51:58Z,2024-01-31T09:11:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01269v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01269v5,"math.LO, math.AG, math.NT, 03C64, 11J81, 13J05, 13J30, 14P10, 32B20, 51M25"
Infinitesimal deformations of null-filiform Leibniz superalgebras,"A. Kh. Khudoyberdiyev, B. A. Omirov","In this paper we describe the infinitesimal deformations of null-filiform Leibniz superalgebras over a field of zero characteristic. It is known that up to isomorphism in each dimension there exist two such superalgebras $NF^{n,m}$. One of them is a Leibniz algebra (that is $m=0$) and the second one is a pure Leibniz superalgebra (that is $m\neq 0$) of maximum nilindex. We show that the closure of union of orbits of single-generated Leibniz algebras forms an irreducible component of the variety of Leibniz algebras. We prove that any single-generated Leibniz algebra is a linear integrable deformation of the algebra $NF^{n}$. Similar results for the case of Leibniz superalgebras are obtained.",2013-03-30T17:23:39Z,2013-03-30T17:23:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0126v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0126v1,"math.AG, math.RA, 17A32, 17A70, 17B30, 13D10, 16S80"
Notes on $G_2$: The Lie algebra and the Lie group,Cristina Draper,"These notes have been prepared for the Workshop on ""(Non)-existence of complex structures on $\mathbb{S}^6$"", to be celebrated in Marburg in March, 2017. The material is not intended to be original. It contains a survey about the smallest of the exceptional Lie groups: $G_2$, its definition and different characterizations joint with its relationship with $\mathbb{S}^6$ and with $\mathbb{S}^7$. With the exception of the summary of the Killing-Cartan classification, this survey is self-contained, and all the proofs are given, mainly following linear algebra arguments. Although these proofs are well-known, they are spread and some of them are difficult to find. The approach is algebraical, working at the Lie algebra level most of times. We analyze the complex Lie algebra (and group) of type $G_2$ as well as the two real Lie algebras of type $G_2$, the split and the compact one. Octonions will appear, but it is not the starting point. Also, 3-forms approach and spinorial approach are viewed and related.",2017-04-25T17:56:31Z,2017-08-07T15:36:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07819v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07819v2,"math.RA, math.DG, 17B25, 22E60"
Homotopy morphisms between convolution homotopy Lie algebras,"Daniel Robert-Nicoud, Felix Wierstra","In previous works by the authors, a bifunctor was associated to any operadic twisting morphism, taking a coalgebra over a cooperad and an algebra over an operad, and giving back the space of (graded) linear maps between them endowed with a homotopy Lie algebra structure. We build on this result by using a more general notion of $\infty$-morphism between (co)algebras over a (co)operad associated to a twisting morphism, and show that this bifunctor can be extended to take such $\infty$-morphisms in either one of its two slots. We also provide a counterexample proving that it cannot be coherently extended to accept $\infty$-morphisms in both slots simultaneously. We apply this theory to rational models for mapping spaces.",2017-12-03T16:39:45Z,2020-01-19T14:05:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00794v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00794v2,"math.AT, math-ph, math.MP, math.QA, math.RA, Primary 18D50, Secondary 55P62, 18G55"
A description of pseudo-bosons in terms of nilpotent Lie algebras,"Fabio Bagarello, Francesco G. Russo","We show how the one-mode pseudo-bosonic ladder operators provide concrete examples of nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension five. It is the first time that an algebraic-geometric structure of this kind is observed in the context of pseudo-bosonic operators. Indeed we don't find the well known Heisenberg algebras, which are involved in several quantum dynamical systems, but different Lie algebras which may be decomposed in the sum of two abelian Lie algebras in a prescribed way. We introduce the notion of semidirect sum (of Lie algebras) for this scope and find that it describes very well the behaviour of pseudo-bosonic operators in many quantum models.",2017-12-13T07:20:11Z,2017-12-13T07:20:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04631v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04631v1,"math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"
Braided Cartan Calculi and Submanifold Algebras,Thomas Weber,"We construct a noncommutative Cartan calculus on any braided commutative algebra and study its applications in noncommutative geometry. The braided Lie derivative, insertion and de Rham differential are introduced and related via graded braided commutators, also incorporating the braided Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. The resulting braided Cartan calculus generalizes the Cartan calculus on smooth manifolds and the twisted Cartan calculus. While it is a necessity of derivation based Cartan calculi on noncommutative algebras to employ central bimodules our approach allows to consider bimodules over the full underlying algebra. Furthermore, equivariant covariant derivatives and metrics on braided commutative algebras are discussed. In particular, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an equivariant Levi-Civita covariant derivative for any fixed non-degenerate equivariant metric. Operating in a symmetric braided monoidal category we argue that Drinfel'd twist deformation corresponds to gauge equivalences of braided Cartan calculi. The notions of equivariant covariant derivative and metric are compatible with the Drinfel'd functor as well. Moreover, we project braided Cartan calculi to submanifold algebras and prove that this process commutes with twist deformation.",2019-07-31T17:21:51Z,2020-02-10T12:01:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13609v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13609v3,"math.QA, math-ph, math.MP"
On the structure group of an infinite dimensional JB-algebra,"Gabriel Larotonda, José Luna","We extend several results for the structure group of a real Jordan algebra $V$, to the setting of infinite dimensional JB-algebras. We prove that the structure group $Str(V)$, the cone preserving group $G(\Omega)$ and the automorphism group $Aut(V)$ of the algebra $V$ are embedded Banach-Lie groups of $GL(V)$, and that each of the inclusions $Aut(V)\subset G(\Omega)\subset Str(V)$ are of embedded Banach-Lie subgroups. We give a full description of the components of $Str(V)$ via cones, isotopes and central projections. We apply these results to $V=B(H)_{sa}$ the special JB-algebra of self-adjoint operators on an infinite dimensional complex Hilbert space, describing the groups $Str(V), G(\Omega), Aut(V)$, their Banach-Lie algebras and their connected components. We show that the action of the unitary group of $H$ on $Aut(V)$ has smooth local cross sections, thus $Aut(V)$ is a smooth principal bundle over the unitary group, with circle structure group.",2022-06-10T18:39:31Z,2022-09-18T23:11:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05320v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05320v2,"math.FA, math.DG, math.GR, math.RA, 22E65, 17C10 (Primary) 58B25 (Secondary)"
Laplacian flow of homogeneous G2-structures and its solitons,Jorge Lauret,"We use the bracket flow/algebraic soliton approach to study the Laplacian flow of $G_2$-structures and its solitons in the homogeneous case. We prove that any homogeneous Laplacian soliton is equivalent to a semi-algebraic soliton (i.e.\ a $G$-invariant $G_2$-structure on a homogeneous space $G/K$ that flows by pull-back of automorphisms of $G$ up to scaling). Algebraic solitons are geometrically characterized among Laplacian solitons as those with a `diagonal' evolution. Unlike the Ricci flow case, where any homogeneous Ricci soliton is isometric to an algebraic soliton, we have found, as an application of the above characterization, an example of a left-invariant closed semi-algebraic soliton on a nilpotent Lie group which is not equivalent to any algebraic soliton. The (normalized) bracket flow evolution of such a soliton is periodic. In the context of solvable Lie groups with a codimension-one abelian normal subgroup, we obtain long time existence for any closed Laplacian flow solution; furthermore, the norm of the torsion is strictly decreasing and converges to zero. We also classify algebraic solitons in this class and exhibit several explicit examples of closed expanding Laplacian solitons.",2016-02-26T15:31:01Z,2016-11-15T11:52:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08367v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.08367v2,math.DG
Coherent states in quantum $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$ algebra and   qq-character for 5d Super Yang-Mills,"Jean-Emile Bourgine, Masayuki Fukuda, Yutaka Matsuo, Hong Zhang, Rui-Dong Zhu","The instanton partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ 5d super Yang-Mills are built using elements of the representation theory of quantum $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$ algebra: Gaiotto state, intertwiner, vertex operator. This algebra is also known under the names of Ding-Iohara-Miki and quantum toroidal $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(1)$ algebra. Exploiting the explicit action of the algebra on the partition function, we prove the regularity of the 5d qq-characters.

Approximation and interpolation of regular maps from affine varieties to   algebraic manifolds,"Finnur Larusson, Tuyen Trung Truong","We consider the analogue for regular maps from affine varieties to suitable algebraic manifolds of Oka theory for holomorphic maps from Stein spaces to suitable complex manifolds. The goal is to understand when the obstructions to approximation or interpolation are purely topological. We propose a definition of an algebraic Oka property, which is stronger than the analytic Oka property. We review the known examples of algebraic manifolds satisfying the algebraic Oka property and add a new class of examples: smooth nondegenerate toric varieties. On the other hand, we show that the algebraic analogues of three of the central properties of analytic Oka theory fail for all compact manifolds and manifolds with a rational curve; in particular, for projective manifolds.",2017-06-01T23:03:11Z,2019-07-04T01:45:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00519v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00519v3,"math.AG, math.CV, 14R10 (Primary), 14M20, 14M25, 32E10, 32Q28 (Secondary)"

Let $\mathcal{K}$ be the kernel of the canonical map $\alpha: \text{Sym}(I) \rightarrow \text{Rees}(I)$ from the symmetric algebra of $I$ onto the Rees algebra of $I$. We prove that $\mathcal{K}$ can be described as the solution set of a system of differential equations, that the whole bigraded structure of $\mathcal{K}$ is characterized by the integral roots of certain $b$-functions, and that certain de Rham cohomology groups can give partial information about $\mathcal{K}$.",2017-06-19T23:26:09Z,2018-07-27T15:03:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06215v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06215v2,"math.AC, math.AG, 13A30, 13N10 (Primary) 13D02, 14H50 (Secondary)"
Nil Hecke algebras and Whittaker D-modules,Victor Ginzburg,"Given a reductive group G, Kostant and Kumar defined a nil Hecke algebra that may be viewed as a degenerate version of the double affine nil Hecke algebra introduced by Cherednik. In this paper, we construct an isomorphism of the spherical subalgebra of the nil Hecke algebra with a Whittaker type quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the algebra of differential operators on G. This result has an interpretation in terms of the geometric Satake and the Langlands dual group. Specifically, the isomorphism provides a bridge between very differently looking descriptions of equivariant Borel-Moore homology of the affine flag variety (due to Kostant and Kumar) and of the affine Grassmannian (due to Bezrukavnikov and Finkelberg), respectively.   It follows from our result that the category of Whittaker D-modules on G considered by Drinfeld is equivalent to the category of holonomic modules over the nil Hecke algebra, and it is also equivalent to a certain subcategory of the category of Weyl group equivariant holonomic D-modules on the maximal torus.",2017-06-21T06:16:56Z,2018-04-17T03:45:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06751v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06751v4,"math.RT, math.AG"

The fundamental group of a noncommutative space,"Walter D. van Suijlekom, Jeroen Winkel","We introduce and analyse a general notion of fundamental group for noncommutative spaces, described by differential graded algebras. For this we consider connections on finitely generated projective bimodules over differential graded algebras and show that the category of flat connections on such modules forms a Tannakian category. As such this category can be realised as the category of representations of an affine group scheme $G$, which in the classical case is (the pro-algebraic completion of) the usual fundamental group. This motivates us to define $G$ to be the fundamental group of the noncommutative space under consideration. The needed assumptions on the differential graded algebra are rather mild and completely natural in the context of noncommutative differential geometry. We establish the appropriate functorial properties, homotopy and Morita invariance of this fundamental group. As an example we find that the fundamental group of the noncommutative torus can be described as the algebraic hull of the topological group $(\mathbb Z+\theta \mathbb Z)^2$.",2019-10-22T17:29:13Z,2019-10-22T17:29:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10127v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10127v1,"math.QA, math.AT"

Using results on such equations, we prove the convergence of the formal Puiseux series solutions of the system, expanded around a finite point or at infinity, and we present an algorithm to describe them. In addition, we bound the degree of the possible algebraic and rational solutions, and we provide an algorithm to decide their existence and to compute such solutions if they exist.

Membership deformation of commutativity and obscure $n$-ary algebras,Steven Duplij,"A general mechanism for ""breaking"" commutativity in algebras is proposed: if the underlying set is taken to be not a crisp set, but rather an obscure/fuzzy set, the membership function, reflecting the degree of truth that an element belongs to the set, can be incorporated into the commutation relations. The special ""deformations"" of commutativity and $\varepsilon $-commutativity are introduced in such a way that equal degrees of truth result in the ""nondeformed"" case.

In this note, using the DGA of tangent bundle with the Schouten bracket as a model, we start from an abstract Lie algebra, construct non-trivial Lie superalgebra by Schouten-like bracket.

Stability of closedness of semi-algebraic sets under continuous   semi-algebraic mappings,"Si Tiep Dinh, Zbigniew Jelonek, Tien Son Pham","Given a closed semi-algebraic set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and a continuous semi-algebraic mapping $G \colon X \to \mathbb{R}^m,$ it will be shown that there exists an open dense semi-algebraic subset $\mathscr{U}$ of $L(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{R}^m),$ the space of all linear mappings from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m,$ such that for all $F \in \mathscr{U},$ the image $(F + G)(X)$ is a closed (semi-algebraic) set in $\mathbb{R}^m.$ To do this, we study the tangent cone at infinity $C_\infty X$ and the set $E_\infty X \subset C_\infty X$ of (unit) exceptional directions at infinity of $X.$ Specifically we show that the set $E_\infty X$ is nowhere dense in $C_\infty X \cap \mathbb{S}^{n - 1}.$",2020-10-10T08:54:58Z,2021-04-02T04:50:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04952v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04952v2,math.AG
Cancellation of vector bundles of rank $3$ with trivial Chern classes on   smooth affine fourfolds,Tariq Syed,"If $n \equiv 0,1~mod~4$, we prove a sum formula $V_{\theta_{0}} (a_{0},a_{R}^{n}) = n \cdot V_{\theta_{0}} (a_{0},a_{R})$ for the generalized Vaserstein symbol whenever $R$ is a smooth affine algebra over a perfect field $k$ with $char(k) \neq 2$ such that $-1 \in {k^{\times}}^{2}$. This enables us to generalize a result of Fasel-Rao-Swan on transformations of unimodular rows via elementary matrices over normal affine algebras of dimension $d \geq 4$ over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $\neq 2$. As a consequence, we prove that any projective module of rank $3$ with trivial Chern classes over a smooth affine algebra of dimension $4$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ with $char(k) \neq 2,3$ is cancellative.",2020-10-13T20:28:04Z,2022-02-21T22:50:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07690v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07690v2,"math.AG, math.AC, math.KT"
Symplectic groups over noncommutative algebras,"Daniele Alessandrini, Arkady Berenstein, Vladimir Retakh, Eugen Rogozinnikov, Anna Wienhard","We introduce the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}_2(A,\sigma)$ over a noncommutative algebra $A$ with an anti-involution $\sigma$. We realize several classical Lie groups as $\mathrm{Sp}_2$ over various noncommutative algebras, which provides new insights into their structure theory.   We construct several geometric spaces, on which the groups $\mathrm{Sp}_2(A,\sigma)$ act. We introduce the space of isotropic $A$-lines, which generalizes the projective line. We describe the action of $\mathrm{Sp}_2(A,\sigma)$ on isotropic $A$-lines, generalize the Kashiwara-Maslov index of triples and the cross ratio of quadruples of isotropic $A$-lines as invariants of this action. When the algebra $A$ is Hermitian or the complexification of a Hermitian algebra, we introduce the symmetric space $X_{\mathrm{Sp}_2(A,\sigma)}$, and construct different models of this space.   Applying this to classical Hermitian Lie groups of tube type (realized as $\mathrm{Sp}_2(A,\sigma)$) and their complexifications, we obtain different models of the symmetric space as noncommutative generalizations of models of the hyperbolic plane and of the three-dimensional hyperbolic space.

Generalized cohomology theories for algebraic stacks,"Adeel A. Khan, Charanya Ravi","We extend the stable motivic homotopy category of Voevodsky to the class of scalloped algebraic stacks, and show that it admits the formalism of Grothendieck's six operations. Objects in this category represent generalized cohomology theories for stacks like algebraic K-theory, as well as new examples like genuine motivic cohomology and algebraic cobordism. These cohomology theories admit Gysin maps and satisfy homotopy invariance, localization, and Mayer-Vietoris. For example, we deduce that homotopy K-theory satisfies cdh descent on scalloped stacks. We also prove a fixed point localization formula for torus actions.   Finally, the construction is contrasted with a ""lisse-extended"" stable motivic homotopy category, defined for arbitrary stacks: we show for example that lisse-extended motivic cohomology of quotient stacks is computed by the equivariant higher Chow groups of Edidin-Graham, and we also get a good new theory of Borel-equivariant algebraic cobordism. Moreover, the lisse-extended motivic homotopy type is shown to recover all previous constructions of motives of stacks.",2021-06-28T22:08:26Z,2024-10-08T01:27:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15001v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15001v5,"math.AG, math.AT, math.KT"

As a result, we give a necessary condition when the product of two simple modules over a KLR algebra is simple using the set of irreducible components of quiver Grassmannians.

Categorical and K-theoretic Hall algebras for quivers with potential,Tudor Pădurariu,"Given a quiver with potential $(Q,W)$, Kontsevich-Soibelman constructed a Hall algebra on the critical cohomology of the stack of representations of $(Q,W)$. Special cases of this construction are related to work of Nakajima, Varagnolo, Schiffmann-Vasserot, Maulik-Okounkov, Yang-Zhao etc. about geometric constructions of Yangians and their representations; indeed, given a quiver $Q$, there exists an associated pair $\left(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{W}\right)$ whose CoHA is conjecturally the positive half of the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian $Y_{\text{MO}}(\mathfrak{g}_Q)$.   For a quiver with potential $(Q,W)$, we follow a suggestion of Kontsevich-Soibelman and study a categorification of the above algebra constructed using categories of singularities. Its Grothendieck group is a K-theoretic Hall algebra (KHA) for quivers with potential. We construct representations using framed quivers and we prove a wall-crossing theorem for KHAs.

Blowup algebras of determinantal ideals in prime characteristic,"Alessandro De Stefani, Jonathan Montaño, Luis Núñez-Betancourt","We study when blowup algebras are $F$-split or strongly $F$-regular. Our main focus is on algebras given by symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals of minors of a generic matrix, a symmetric matrix, and a Hankel matrix. We also study ideals of Pfaffians of a skew-symmetric matrix. We use these results to obtain bounds on the degrees of the defining equations for these algebras. We also prove that the limit of the normalized regularity of the symbolic powers of these ideals exists and that their depth stabilizes. Finally, we show that, for determinantal ideals, there exists a monomial order for which taking initial ideals commutes with taking symbolic powers. To obtain these results we develop the notion of $F$-split filtrations and symbolic $F$-split ideals.",2021-09-01T19:47:49Z,2024-06-18T16:06:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00592v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00592v4,"math.AC, math.AG, 13A30, 13A35, 13A02, 13C15"

We give new Haas' like criteria for patchworking non-singular real algebraic curves with prescribed number of connected components, in terms of twisted edges on a non-singular tropical curve. We then obtain several sufficient conditions for patchworking non-singular real algebraic curves with only ovals in their real part.

The component structure results from the intersection of two opposing filtrations of the family Gor(H) of AG algebras: that by Jordan type satisfies the usual dominance property; the second filtration, by symmetric decomposition, satisfies a known semicontinuity property.

On the other hand, we show that one fixes any division algebra over a field, then any division algebras sharing the same splitting fields of transcendence degree at most 3 must generate the same cyclic subgroup of the Brauer group.

The resolvent degree is the minimal integer $d$ such that every root of $f(x)$ can be obtained in a finite number of steps, starting with $\mathbb C(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ and adjoining algebraic functions in $\leq d$ variables at each step.

Schur-Sato theory for quasi-elliptic rings,Alexander Zheglov,"The notion of quasi-elliptic rings appeared as a result of an attempt to classify a wide class of commutative rings of operators found in the theory of integrable systems, such as rings of commuting differential, difference, differential-difference, etc. operators.

An important algebraic part of this description is the Schur-Sato theory - a generalisation of the well known theory for ordinary differential operators. Some parts of this theory were developed earlier in a series of papers, mostly for dimension two.   In this paper we present this theory in arbitrary dimension. We apply this theory to prove two classification theorems of quasi-elliptic rings in terms of certain pairs of subspaces (Schur pairs).

Bracelets bases are theta bases,"Travis Mandel, Fan Qin","The skein algebra of a marked surface, possibly with punctures, admits the basis of (tagged) bracelet elements constructed by Fock-Goncharov and Musiker-Schiffler-Williams. As a cluster algebra, it also admits the theta basis of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, quantized by Davison-Mandel. We show that these two bases coincide (with a caveat for notched arcs in once-punctured tori). In unpunctured cases, one may consider the quantum skein algebra. We show that the quantized bases also coincide. Even for cases with punctures, we define quantum bracelets for the cluster algebras with coefficients, and we prove that these are again theta functions. On the corresponding cluster Poisson varieties (parameterizing framed $PGL_2$-local systems), we prove in general that the canonical coordinates of Fock-Goncharov, quantized by Bonahon-Wong and Allegretti-Kim, coincide with the associated (quantum) theta functions. Long-standing conjectures on strong positivity and atomicity follow as corollaries. Of potentially independent interest, we examine the behavior of cluster scattering diagrams under folding.",2023-01-26T13:51:56Z,2023-04-20T22:00:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11101v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11101v3,"math.QA, math.AG, math.CO, math.GT, math.RT"

Classification of complex algebraic curves under blow-spherical   equivalence,"José Edson Sampaio, Euripedes Carvalho da Silva","This article is devoted to studying complex algebraic sets under (global) blow-spherical equivalence.

Exceptional real Lie algebras $\mathfrak{f}_4$ and $\mathfrak{e}_6$ via   contactifications,Pawel Nurowski,"In Cartan's PhD thesis, there is a formula defining a certain rank 8 vector distribution in dimension 15, whose algebra of authomorphism is the split real form of the simple exceptional complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}_4$. Cartan's formula is written in the standard Cartesian coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^{15}$. In the present paper we explain how to find analogous formula for the flat models of any bracket generating distribution $\mathcal D$ whose symbol algebra $\mathfrak{n}({\mathcal D})$ is constant and 2-step graded, $\mathfrak{n}({\mathcal D})=\mathfrak{n}_{-2}\oplus\mathfrak{n}_{-1}$.

On Higher Dimensional Milnor Frames,Hayden Hunter,"A classic result of Milnor shows that any 3-dimensional unimodular metric Lie algebra admits an orthonormal frame with at most three nontrivial structure constants. These frames are referred to as Milnor frames. We define extensions of Milnor frames into higher dimensions and refer to these higher dimensional analogues as Lie algebras with Milnor frames. We determine that $n$-dimensional, $n \geq 4$, Lie algebras with Milnor frames are isomorphic to the direct sum of 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebras $\mathfrak{h}^3$, 4-dimensional 3-step nilpotent Lie algebras $\mathfrak{h}^4$, and an abelian Lie algebra $\mathfrak{a}$.

On the perfection of algebraic spaces,Tianwei Liang,"This paper is a subsequent paper of arXiv:2303.07672. We will continue our research on the subject of perfect algebraic spaces that is developed in arXiv:2303.07672. By means of algebraic Frobenius morphisms, we define the perfection of arbitrary algebraic spaces of prime characteristic. There is a natural perfection functors on algebraic spaces. We prove several desired properties of the perfection functor. This extends nearly all previous results of the perfection functor on schemes, including the recent ones developed by Bertapelle et al. in arXiv:1611.02060. Moreover, our theory extends the previous one developed by Xinwen Zhu in arXiv:1707.05700v1, arXiv:1407.8519.   The perfection functor rises the notion of perfection of sites, which enables us to restate some of Zhu's theory in arXiv:1707.05700v1.

Complex surfaces with many algebraic structures,"Anna Abasheva, Rodion Déev","We find new examples of complex surfaces with countably many non-isomorphic algebraic structures. Here is one such example: take an elliptic curve $E$ in $\mathbb P^2$ and blow up nine general points on $E$. Then the complement $M$ of the strict transform of $E$ in the blow-up has countably many algebraic structures. Moreover, each algebraic structure comes from an embedding of $M$ into a blow-up of $\mathbb P^2$ in nine points lying on an elliptic curve $F\not\simeq E$. We classify algebraic structures on $M$ using a Hopf transform: a way of constructing a new surface by cutting out an elliptic curve and pasting a different one. Next, we introduce the notion of an analytic K-theory of varieties. Manipulations with the example above lead us to prove that classes of all elliptic curves in this K-theory coincide. To put in another way, all motivic measures on complex algebraic varieties that take equal values on biholomorphic varieties do not distinguish elliptic curves.",2023-03-19T20:46:11Z,2023-03-19T20:46:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10764v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10764v1,"math.CV, math.AG, math.KT, 32J05 (Primary) 14J26, 19E99, 32Q40, 14H52 (Secondary)"
Algebraic capacities as tropical polynomials over the reduced   $c_1$-positive symplectic cone,"Tian-Jun Li, Shengzhen Ning","In a series of work [Wor22], [Wor21] and [CW20], algebraic capacities were introduced in an algebraic manner for polarized algebraic surfaces and applied to the symplectic embedding problems. In this paper, we give a reformulation of algebraic capacities in terms of only a tamed pair of symplectic form and almost complex structure. We show that they actually only depend on the cohomology class of the symplectic form for a rational manifold. Since it is not known that any symplectic form on a rational manifold is K\""{a}hler, this novel formulation potentially is more general on a rational manifold. Additionally, for manifolds with $b^+=1$, we derive asymptotic results that are parallel to the context of ECH(Embedded Contact Homology) and algebraic settings. When assuming $c_1\cdot [\omega]>0$ on rational manifolds, we further introduce a sequence of tropical polynomials which will succinctly describe those capacities viewed as functions over the domain parametrizing such symplectic forms. As an application, we give a purely symplectic proof of the correspondence between algebraic capacities and ECH capacities for smooth toric surfaces.",2023-03-22T14:45:36Z,2024-09-20T15:06:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12607v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12607v2,math.SG

We prove that the algebraic crossed product $L^{\infty}X \rtimes_{\rm alg} \Gamma$ surjects onto $\mathbb C_{\rm fp}[\Gamma \curvearrowright X]$ and that this surjection is a $\ast$-isomorphism whenever the action is essentially free. As a consequence, we canonically characterize ergodicity and strong ergodicity of the action in terms of structural properties of $\mathbb C_{\rm fp}[\Gamma \curvearrowright X]$ and its closure.

On Harish-Chandra modules over quantizations of nilpotent orbits,"Ivan Losev, Shilin Yu","Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over the complex numbers and $K$ be a connected reductive group mapping to $G$ so that the Lie algebra of $K$ gets identified with a symmetric subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. So we can talk about Harish-Chandra $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. The goal of this paper is to give a geometric classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with full support over the filtered quantizations of the algebras of the form $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{O}]$, where $\mathbb{O}$ is a nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{g}$ with codimension of the boundary at least $4$. Namely, we embed the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules into the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible $K$-equivariant suitably twisted local systems on $\mathbb{O}\cap \mathfrak{k}^\perp$. We show that under certain conditions, for example when $K\subset G$ or when $\mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{so}_n,\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, this embedding is in fact a bijection. On the other hand, for $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_n$ and $K=\operatorname{Spin}_n$, the embedding is not bijective and we give a description of the image.

Over algebraically closed fields~$\mathbb{K}$ of characteristic $p>0$, we classify the W-gradings (corresponding to a maximal subalgebra of finite codimension) of the known simple vectorial Lie (super)algebras with unconstrained shearing vector of heights of the indeterminates, distinguish W-gradings of (super)algebras preserving non-integrable distributions.

This allows us to provide a unified proof of C*-rigidity for Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators.

Our generalization extends the scope of this conjecture to Artin $L$-functions of Galois representations of finite, function, and totally real number fields. The statement of this conjecture relates norms of the special values of these $L$-functions to sizes of equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups with coefficients in an equivariant Moore spectrum attached to a Galois representation.   We prove this conjecture in many cases, integrally, except up to a possible factor of powers of $2$ in the non-abelian and totally real number field case. In the finite field case, we further determine the group structures of their equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups with coefficients in Galois representations. At heart, our method lifts the M\""obius inversion formula for factorizations of zeta functions as a product of $L$-functions, to the $E_1$-page of an equivariant spectral sequence converging to equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups.

The mod p cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group at large primes,"Mohammad Behzad Kang, Andrew Salch","We calculate the cohomology of the extended Morava stabilizer group of height $n$, with trivial mod $p$ coefficients, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p>>n$. The result is an exterior algebra on $n$ generators. A brief sketch of the method: we introduce a family of deformations of Ravenel's Lie algebra model $L(n,n)$ for the Morava stabilizer group scheme. This yields a family of DGAs, parameterized over an affine line and smooth except at a single point. The singular fiber is the Chevalley-Eilenberg DGA of Ravenel's Lie algebra. Consequently the cohomology of the singular fiber is the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group, at large primes. We prove a derived version of the invariant cycles theorem from Hodge theory, which allows us to compare the cohomology of the singular fiber to the fixed-points of the Picard-Lefschetz (monodromy) operator on the cohomology of a smooth fiber. Finally, we use some new methods for constructing small models for cohomology of reductive Lie algebras to show that the cohomology of the Picard-Lefschetz fixed-points on a smooth fiber agrees with the singular cohomology $H^*(U(n);\mathbb{F}_p)$ of the unitary group, which is the desired exterior algebra.",2024-10-31T17:38:15Z,2024-10-31T17:38:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24171v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24171v1,"math.AT, math.AG, 55Q10, 55Q45, 20J06, 14D05"

This means that many existing algebraic complexity lower bound proofs can be efficiently converted into isotypic lower bound proofs via highest weight metapolynomials, a notion studied in geometric complexity theory. In the context of algebraic natural proofs, our result means that without loss of generality algebraic natural proofs can be assumed to be isotypic.

The role of dilations in diffeomorphism covariant algebraic quantum   field theory,M. Rainer,"The quantum analogue of general relativistic geometry should be implementable on smooth manifolds without an a priori metric structure, the kinematical covariance group acting by diffeomorphisms.   Here I approach quantum gravity (QG) in the view of constructive, algebraic quantum field theory (QFT). Comparing QG with usual QFT, the algebraic approach clarifies analogies and peculiarities. As usual, an isotonic net of *-algebras is taken to encode the quantum field operators. For QG, the kinematical covariance group acts via diffeomorphisms on the open sets of the manifold, and via algebraic isomorphisms on the algebras. In general, the algebra of observables is covariant only under a (dynamical) subgroup of the general diffeomorphism group.   After an algebraic implementation of the dynamical subgroup of dilations, small and large scale cutoffs may be introduced algebraically. So the usual a priori conflict of cutoffs with general covariance is avoided. Even more, these cutoffs provide a natural local cobordism for topological quantum field theory.   A new commutant duality between the minimal and maximal algebra allows to extract the modular structure from the net of algebras. The outer modular isomorphisms are then again related to dilations, which (under certain conditions) may provide a notion of time.",1997-10-15T21:46:16Z,1999-04-02T06:14:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9710081v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9710081v3,gr-qc
Noncommutative algebras related with Schubert calculus on Coxeter groups,"Anatol N.

We define a ``quantization'' and a multiparameter deformation of our construction and show that for Lie groups of classical type and $G_2,$ the algebra generated by Dunkl elements in the quantized bracket algebra is canonically isomorphic to the small quantum cohomology ring of the corresponding flag variety, as described by B.

Integrating infinite-dimensional Lie algebras by a Tannaka   reconstruction (Part I),Claus Mokler,"Let g be a Lie algebra over a field F of characteristic zero, let C be a certain tensor category of representations of g, and C-du a certain category of duals. By a Tannaka reconstruction we associate to C and C-du a monoid M with coordinate ring of matrix coefficients F[M], (which has in general no natural coalgebra structure), as well as a Lie algebra Lie(M). We interprete the monoid M algebraic geometrically as a weak algebraic monoid with Lie algebra Lie(M). The monoid M acts by morphisms of varieties on every object of C, the Lie algebra Lie(M) acts by the differentiated action.

"Double constructions of Frobenius algebras, Connes cocycles and their   duality",Chengming Bai,"We construct an associative algebra with a decomposition into the direct sum of the underlying vector spaces of another associative algebra and its dual space such that both of them are subalgebras and the natural symmetric bilinear form is invariant or the natural antisymmetric bilinear form is a Connes cocycle. The former is called a double construction of Frobenius algebra and the latter is called a double construction of Connes cocycle which is interpreted in terms of dendriform algebras. Both of them are equivalent to a kind of bialgebras, namely, antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and dendriform D-bialgebras respectively. In the coboundary cases, our study leads to what we call associative Yang-Baxter equation in an associative algebra and $D$-equation in a dendriform algebra respectively, which are analogues of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Lie algebra. We show that an antisymmetric solution of associative Yang-Baxter equation corresponds to the antisymmetric part of a certain operator called ${\mathcal O}$-operator which gives a double construction of Frobenius algebra, whereas a symmetric solution of $D$-equation corresponds to the symmetric part of an ${\mathcal O}$-operator which gives a double construction of Connes cocycle. By comparing antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and dendriform D-bialgebras, we observe that there is a clear analogy between them. Due to the correspondences between certain symmetries and antisymmetries appearing in the analogy, we regard it as a kind of duality.",2008-08-25T10:58:53Z,2010-08-15T09:23:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3330v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.3330v3,"math-ph, math.MP, math.QA, 16W30, 17A30, 17B60, 57R56, 81T45"
An algebraic study of extension algebras,Syu Kato,"We present simple conditions which guarantee a geometric convolution algebra to behave like a variant of the quasi-hereditary algebra. In particular, standard modules of the affine Hecke algebras of type $\mathsf{BC}$, and the quiver Schur algebras are shown to satisfy the Brauer-Humphreys type reciprocity and the semi-orthogonality property. In addition, we present a new criterion of purity of weights in the geometric side. This yields a proof of Shoji's conjecture on limit symbols of type $\mathsf{B}$ [Shoji, Adv. Stud. Pure Math. 40 (2004)], and the purity of the exotic Springer fibers [K, Duke Math. 148 (2009)].

A Classification of Real Indecomposable Solvable Lie Algebras of Small   Dimension with Codimension One Nilradicals,Alan R. Parry,"This thesis was concerned with classifying the real indecomposable solvable Lie algebras with codimension one nilradicals of dimensions two through seven. This thesis was organized into three chapters.   In the first, we described the necessary concepts and definitions about Lie algebras as well as a few helpful theorems that are necessary to understand the project. We also reviewed many concepts from linear algebra that are essential to the research.   The second chapter was occupied with a description of how we went about classifying the Lie algebras. In particular, it outlined the basic premise of the classification: that we can use the automorphisms of the nilradical of the Lie algebra to find a basis with the simplest structure equations possible. In addition, it outlined a few other methods that also helped find this basis. Finally, this chapter included a discussion of the canonical forms of certain types of matrices that arose in the project.   The third chapter presented a sample of the classification of the seven dimensional Lie algebras. In it, we proceeded step-by-step through the classification of the Lie algebras whose nilradical was one of four specifically chosen because they were representative of the different types that arose during the project.   In the appendices, we presented our results in a list of the multiplication tables of the isomorphism classes found.",2013-11-24T00:07:40Z,2013-11-24T00:07:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6069v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6069v1,"math.DG, math.RA, 17B30"
Geometric Schur duality of classical type,"Huanchen Bao, Jonathan Kujawa, Yiqiang Li, Weiqiang Wang","This is a generalization of the classic work of Beilinson, Lusztig and MacPherson. In this paper (and an Appendix) we show that the quantum algebras obtained via a BLM-type stabilization procedure in the setting of partial flag varieties of type $B/C$ are two (modified) coideal subalgebras of the quantum general linear Lie algebra, $\dot{\mathbf U}^{\jmath}$ and $\dot{\mathbf U}^{\imath}$. We provide a geometric realization of the Schur-type duality of Bao-Wang between such a coideal algebra and Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type $B$. The monomial bases and canonical bases of the Schur algebras and the modified coideal algebra $\dot{\mathbf U}^{\jmath}$ are constructed. In an Appendix by three authors, a more subtle $2$-step stabilization procedure leading to $\dot{\mathbf U}^{\imath}$ is developed, and then monomial and canonical bases of $\dot{\mathbf U}^{\imath}$ are constructed. It is shown that $\dot{\mathbf U}^{\imath}$ is a subquotient of $\dot{\mathbf U}^{\jmath}$ with compatible canonical bases. Moreover, a compatibility between canonical bases for modified coideal algebras and Schur algebras is established.",2014-04-15T17:50:59Z,2017-10-18T17:50:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4000v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.4000v4,"math.RT, math.AG, math.QA"
The geometry of finite dimensional algebras with vanishing radical   square,"Frauke M. Bleher, Ted Chinburg, Birge Huisgen-Zimmermann","Let $\Lambda$ be a basic finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field, with the property that the square of the Jacobson radical $J$ vanishes. We determine the irreducible components of the module variety $\text{Mod}_{\bf d}(\Lambda)$ for any dimension vector $\bf d$. Our description leads to a count of the components in terms of the underlying Gabriel quiver. A closed formula for the number of components when $\Lambda$ is local extends existing counts for the two-loop quiver to quivers with arbitrary finite sets of loops.   For any algebra $\Lambda$ with $J^2 = 0$, our criteria for identifying the components of $\text{Mod}_{\bf d}(\Lambda)$ permit us to characterize the modules parametrized by the individual irreducible components. Focusing on such a component, we explore generic properties of the corresponding modules by establishing a geometric bridge between the algebras with zero radical square on one hand and their stably equivalent hereditary counterparts on the other. The bridge links certain closed subvarieties of Grassmannians parametrizing the modules with fixed top over the two types of algebras. By way of this connection, we transfer results of Kac and Schofield from the hereditary case to algebras of Loewy length $2$. Finally, we use the transit of information to show that any algebra of Loewy length $2$ which enjoys the dense orbit property in the sense of Chindris, Kinser and Weyman has finite representation type.",2014-07-11T07:14:39Z,2014-07-11T07:14:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3045v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.3045v1,"math.RT, math.RA"
How many varieties of cylindric algebras,"H. Andréka, I. Németi","Cylindric algebras, or concept algebras in another name, form an interface between algebra, geometry and logic; they were invented by Alfred Tarski around 1947. We prove that there are 2 to the alpha many varieties of geometric (i.e., representable) alpha-dimensional cylindric algebras, this means that 2 to the alpha properties of definable relations of (possibly infinitary) models of first-order logic theories can be expressed by formula schemes using alpha variables, where alpha is infinite. This solves Problem 4.2 in the 1985 Henkin-Monk-Tarski monograph. For solving this problem, we had to devise a new kind of construction, which we then use to solve Problem 2.13 of the 1971 Henkin-Monk-Tarski monograph which concerns the structural description of geometric cylindric algebras. There are fewer varieties generated by locally finite dimensional cylindric algebras, and we get a characterization of these among all the 2 to the alpha varieties. As a by-product, we get a simple, natural recursive enumeration of all the equations true of geometric cylindric algebras, and this can serve as a solution to Problem 4.1 of the 1985 Henkin-Monk-Tarski monograph. All this has logical content and implications concerning ordinary first order logic with a countable number of variables.",2015-09-12T13:46:10Z,2015-09-12T13:46:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03743v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03743v1,"math.LO, 03Gxx, 03G15, 08B15, 03B10, 03C40, 03C05, 08A65, 03A10"
Exceptional quantum geometry and particle physics,Michel Dubois-Violette,"Based on an interpretation of the quark-lepton symmetry in terms of the unimodularity of the color group $SU(3)$ and on the existence of 3 generations, we develop an argumentation suggesting that the ""finite quantum space"" corresponding to the exceptional real Jordan algebra of dimension 27 (the Euclidean Albert algebra) is relevant for the description of internal spaces in the theory of particles. In particular, the triality which corresponds to the 3 off-diagonal octonionic elements of the exceptional algebra is associated to the 3 generations of the Standard Model while the representation of the octonions as a complex 4-dimensional space $\mathbb C\oplus\mathbb C^3$ is associated to the quark-lepton symmetry, (one complex for the lepton and 3 for the corresponding quark). More generally it is is suggested that the replacement of the algebra of real functions on spacetime by the algebra of functions on spacetime with values in a finite-dimensional Euclidean Jordan algebra which plays the role of ""the algebra of real functions"" on the corresponding almost classical quantum spacetime is relevant in particle physics. This leads us to study the theory of Jordan modules and to develop the differential calculus over Jordan algebras, (i.e. to introduce the appropriate notion of differential forms). We formulate the corresponding definition of connections on Jordan modules.",2016-04-04T15:45:53Z,2016-05-01T15:16:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01247v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01247v2,"math.QA, gr-qc, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, math.RA"
Crystals and monodromy of Bethe vectors,"Iva Halacheva, Joel Kamnitzer, Leonid Rybnikov, Alex Weekes","Fix a semisimple Lie algebra g. Gaudin algebras are commutative algebras acting on tensor product multiplicity spaces for g-representations. These algebras depend on a parameter which is a point in the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of marked stable genus 0 curves. When the parameter is real, then the Gaudin algebra acts with simple spectrum on the tensor product multiplicity space and gives us a basis of eigenvectors. In this paper, we study the monodromy of these eigenvectors as the parameter varies within the real locus; this gives an action of the fundamental group of this moduli space, which is called the cactus group.   We prove a conjecture of Etingof which states that the monodromy of eigenvectors for Gaudin algebras agrees with the action of the cactus group on tensor products of g-crystals. In fact, we prove that the coboundary category of normal g-crystals can be reconstructed using the coverings of the moduli spaces.   Our main tool is the construction of a crystal structure on the set of eigenvectors for shift of argument algebras, another family of commutative algebras which act on any irreducible g-representation. We also prove that the monodromy of such eigenvectors is given by the internal cactus group action on g-crystals.",2017-08-16T23:26:30Z,2020-01-15T21:13:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05105v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05105v3,"math.RT, math.AG, math.QA"
Palatial Twistors from Quantum Inhomogeneous Conformal Symmetries and   Twistorial DSR Algebras,Jerzy Lukierski,"We construct recently introduced palatial NC twistors by considering the pair of conjugated (Born-dual) twist-deformed $D=4$ quantum inhomegeneous conformal Hopf algebras $\mathcal{U}_{\theta }(su(2,2)\ltimes T^{4}$) and $\mathcal{U}_{\bar{\theta}}(su(2,2)\ltimes\bar{T}^{4}$), where $T^{4}$ describe complex twistor coordinatesand $\bar{T}^{4}$ the conjugated dual twistor momenta. The palatial twistors are suitably chosen as the quantum-covariant modules (NC representations) of the introduced   Born-dual Hopf algebras. Subsequently we introduce the quantum deformations of $D=4$ Heisenberg-conformal algebra (HCA) $su(2,2)\ltimes H^{4,4}_\hslash$ ($H^{4,4}_\hslash=\bar{T}^4 \ltimes_\hslash T_4$ is the Heisenberg algebra of twistorial oscillators) providing in twistorial framework the basic covariant quantum elementary system.   The class of algebras describing deformation of HCA with dimensionfull deformation parameter, linked with Planck length $\lambda_p$ will be called the twistorial DSR (TDSR) algebra, following the terminology of DSR algebra in space-time framework.   We shall describe the examples of TDSR algebra linked with Palatial twistors which are introduced by the Drinfeld twist and by the quantization map in $H_\hslash^{4,4}$.

Weighted Projective Lines and Rational Surface Singularities,"Osamu Iyama, Michael Wemyss","In this paper we study rational surface singularities R with star shaped dual graphs, and under very mild assumptions on the self-intersection numbers we give an explicit description of all their special Cohen-Macaulay modules. We do this by realising R as a certain Z-graded Veronese subring S^x of the homogeneous coordinate ring S of the Geigle-Lenzing weighted projective line X, and we realise the special CM modules as explicitly described summands of the canonical tilting bundle on X. We then give a second proof that these are special CM modules by comparing qgr S^x and coh X, and we also give a necessary and sufficient combinatorial criterion for these to be equivalent categories. In turn, we show that qgr S^x is equivalent to qgr of the reconstruction algebra, and that the degree zero piece of the reconstruction algebra coincides with Ringel's canonical algebra. This implies that the reconstruction algebra contains the canonical algebra, and furthermore its qgr category is derived equivalent to the canonical algebra, thus linking the reconstruction algebra of rational surface singularities to the canonical algebra of representation theory.",2016-06-30T12:04:35Z,2020-01-13T10:49:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09445v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09445v3,"math.RT, math.AC, math.AG"
On the number of generators of an algebra over a commutative ring,"Uriya A. First, Zinovy Reichstein, Ben Willams","A theorem of O. Forster says that if $R$ is a noetherian ring of Krull dimension $d$, then any projective $R$-module of rank $n$ can be generated by $d+n$ elements. S. Chase and R. Swan subsequently showed that this bound is sharp: there exist examples that cannot be generated by fewer than $d+n$ elements. We view projective $R$-modules as $R$-forms of the non-unital $R$-algebra where the product of any two elements is $0$. The first two authors generalized Forster's theorem to forms of other algebras (not necessarily commutative, associative or unital); A. Shukla and the third author then showed that this generalized Forster bound is optimal for \'etale algebras.   In this paper, we prove new upper and lower bound on the number of generators of an $R$-form of a $k$-algebra, where $k$ is an infinite field and $R$ has finite transcendence degree $d$ over $k$. In particular, we show that, contrary to expectations, for most types of algebras, the generalized Forster bound is far from optimal. Our results are particularly detailed in the case of Azumaya algebras. Our proofs are based on reinterpreting the problem as a question about approximating the classifying stack $BG$, where $G$ is the automorphism group of the algebra in question, by algebraic spaces of a certain form.",2020-12-14T19:27:11Z,2021-09-28T16:56:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07900v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07900v2,"math.RA, math.AG, math.AT, math.GR, 4L30, 16H05, 16S15, 14F25, 55R40"
The Poisson spectrum of the symmetric algebra of the Virasoro algebra,"Alexey V. Petukhov, Susan J. Sierra","Let $W = \mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]\partial_t$ be the Witt algebra of algebraic vector fields on $\mathbb{C}^\times$ and let $Vir$ be the Virasoro algebra, the unique nontrivial central extension of $W$. In this paper, we study the Poisson ideal structure of the symmetric algebras of $Vir$ and $W$, as well as several related Lie algebras. We classify prime Poisson ideals and Poisson primitive ideals of $S(Vir)$ and $S(W)$. In particular, we show that the only functions in $W^*$ which vanish on a nontrivial Poisson ideal (that is, the only maximal ideals of $S(W)$ with a nontrivial Poisson core) are given by linear combinations of derivatives at a finite set of points; we call such functions local. Given a local function $\chi\in W^*$, we construct the associated Poisson primitive ideal through computing the algebraic symplectic leaf of $\chi$, which gives a notion of coadjoint orbit in our setting.   As an application, we prove a structure theorem for subalgebras of $Vir$ of finite codimension and show in particular that any such subalgebra of $Vir$ contains the central element $z$, substantially generalising a result of Ondrus and Wiesner on subalgebras of codimension 1. As a consequence, we deduce that $S(Vir)/(z-\lambda)$ is Poisson simple if and only if $\lambda \neq 0$.",2021-06-04T15:57:17Z,2022-11-18T16:59:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02565v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02565v3,"math.RA, math.AG, 17B68, 17B63, 17B08, 14L99"
Geometric realisations of the unipotent enveloping algebra of a quiver,Lucien Hennecart,"We compare and generalise the various geometric constructions (due to Ringel, Lusztig, Schofield, Bozec, Davison...) of the unipotent generalised Kac-Moody algebra associated with an arbitrary quiver. These constructions are interconnected through several geometric operations, including the stalk Euler characteristic of constructible complexes, the characteristic cycle, the Euler obstruction map, and the intersection multiplicities of Lagrangian subvarieties. We provide a proof that these geometric realisations hold for the integral form of the Lie algebra. Furthermore, by modifying the generators of the enveloping algebra, we ensure compatibility with the natural coproducts that can be defined in terms of restriction diagrams.   As a result, we establish that the top cohomological Hall algebra of the strictly seminilpotent stack is isomorphic to the positive part of the enveloping algebra of the generalised Kac-Moody algebra associated with the quiver. This appears to be one of the cornerstones needed to describe the BPS algebra of very general $2$-Calabi-Yau categories, which is the subject of the author's work on BPS Lie algebras for $2$-Calabi-Yau categories with Davison and Schlegel Mejia.",2022-09-14T11:01:07Z,2024-02-08T14:42:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06552v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06552v4,"math.RT, math.AG"
"Counting in Calabi--Yau categories, with applications to Hall algebras   and knot polynomials","Mikhail Gorsky, Fabian Haiden","We show that homotopy cardinality -- a priori ill-defined for many dg-categories, including all periodic ones -- has a reasonable definition for even-dimensional Calabi--Yau (evenCY) categories and their relative generalizations (under appropriate finiteness conditions).   As a first application we solve the problem of defining an intrinsic Hall algebra for degreewise finite pre-triangulated dg-categories in the case of oddCY categories. We compare this definition with To\""en's derived Hall algebras (in case they are well-defined) and with other approaches based on extended Hall algebras and central reduction, including a construction of Hall algebras associated with Calabi--Yau triples of triangulated categories. For a category equivalent to the root category of a 1CY abelian category $\mathcal A$, the algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the Drinfeld double of the twisted Ringel--Hall algebra of $\mathcal A$, thus resolving in the Calabi--Yau case the long-standing problem of realizing the latter as a Hall algebra intrinsically defined for such a triangulated category.   Our second application is the proof of a conjecture of Ng--Rutherford--Shende--Sivek, which provides an intrinsic formula for the ruling polynomial of a Legendrian knot $L$, and its generalization to Legendrian tangles, in terms of the augmentation category of $L$.",2024-09-16T10:35:45Z,2024-10-25T07:34:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10154v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10154v2,"math.QA, math.CT, math.RA, math.RT, math.SG"
Groupoids derived from the simple elliptic singularities,"Chuangqiang Hu, Stephen S. -T. Yau, Huaiqing Zuo","K. Saito's classification of simple elliptic singularities includes three families of weighted homogeneous singularities: $ \tilde{E}_{6}, \tilde{E}_7$, and $ \tilde{E}_8 $. For each family, the isomorphism classes can be distinguished by K. Saito's $j$-functions. By applying the Mather-Yau theorem, which states that the isomorphism class of an isolated hypersurface singularity is completely determined by its $k$-th moduli algebra, M. Eastwood demonstrated explicitly that one can directly recover K. Saito's $j$-functions from the zeroth moduli algebras. This research aims to generalize M. Eastwood's result through meticulous computation of the groupoids associated with simple elliptic singularities. We not only directly retrieve K. Saito's $j$-functions from the $k$-th moduli algebras but also elucidate the automorphism structure within the $k$-th moduli algebras. We derive the automorphisms using the methodology of the $k$-th Yau algebra and establish a Torelli-type theorem for the $\tilde{E}_7 $-family when $k=1$. In contrast, we find that the Torelli-type theorem is inapplicable for the first Yau algebra in the $ \tilde{E}_6 $-family. By considering the first Yau algebra as a module rather than solely as a Lie algebra, we can impose constraints on the coefficients of the transformation matrices, which facilitates a straightforward identification of all isomorphisms.

Burstall,"We give an account of the classical and integrable geometry of isothermic surfaces in arbitrary co-dimension. We show that the classical transformation theory of Darboux, Bianchi and Calapso goes through unchanged in arbitrary co-dimension as does the connection with the ""curved flats"" of Ferus and Pedit. Moreover, we identify Darboux transformations with the dressing action of ""simple factors"" in the sense of Terng and Uhlenbeck. In so doing, we advertise the use of Vahlen's Clifford algebra matrices as an efficient computational tool in conformal geometry.",2000-03-16T17:17:35Z,2004-08-12T14:29:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0003096v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0003096v3,"math.DG, 53A30;37K35;15A66"
"Explicit birational geometry of 3-folds, Foreword","Alessio Corti, Miles Reid","This is the Foreword to the book ``Explicit birational geometry of 3-folds'', edited by A. Corti and M. Reid, CUP Jun 2000, ISBN: 0 521 63641 8, with papers by K. Altmann, A. Corti, A.R. Iano-Fletcher, J. Koll\'ar, A.V. Pukhlikov and M. Reid.   One of the main achievements of algebraic geometry over the last 20 years is the work of Mori and others extending minimal models and the Enriques--Kodaira classification to 3-folds. This book is an integrated suite of papers centred around applications of Mori theory to birational geometry. Four of the papers (those by Pukhlikov, Fletcher, Corti, and the long joint paper Corti, Pukhlikov and Reid) work out in detail the theory of birational rigidity of Fano 3-folds; these contributions work for the first time with a representative class of Fano varieties, 3-fold hypersurfaces in weighted projective space, and include an attractive introductory treatment and a wealth of detailed computation of special cases.",2000-07-01T16:11:14Z,2000-07-01T16:11:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0007004v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0007004v1,math.AG
On the Geometry of Sasakian-Einstein 5-Manifolds,"Charles P. Boyer, Krzysztof Galicki, Michael Nakamaye","On simply connected five manifolds Sasakian-Einstein metrics coincide with Riemannian metrics admitting real Killing spinors which are of great interest as models of near horizon geometry for three-brane solutions in superstring theory [KW]. We expand on the recent work of Demailly and Koll\'ar [DK] and Johnson and Koll\'ar [JK1] who give methods for constructing K\""ahler-Einstein metrics on log del Pezzo surfaces. By [BG1] circle V-bundles over log del Pezzo surfaces with K\""ahler-Einstein metrics have Sasakian-Einstein metrics on the total space of the bundle. Here these simply connected 5-manifolds arise as links of isolated hypersurface singularities which by the well known work of Smale [Sm] together with [BG3] must be diffeomorphic to $\scriptstyle{S^5#l(S^2\times S^3)}.$ More precisely, using methods from Mori theory in algebraic geometry we prove the existence of 14 inequivalent Sasakian-Einstein structures on $\scriptstyle{S^2\times S^3}$ and infinite families of such structures on $\scriptstyle{#l(S^2\times S^3)}$ with $\scriptstyle{2\leq l\leq7}$.

We compute the radius of the largest ball contained in the symmetric Traveling Salesman Polytope, give a reasonably tight estimate for the radius of the Euclidean ball containing the unit comass ball and review (sometimes with simpler and unified proofs) recent results on the structure of the set of non-negative polynomials (the radius of the inscribed ball, volume estimates, and relations to the sums of squares).

Singular Poisson-Kaehler geometry of Scorza varieties and their secant   varieties,Johannes Huebschmann,"Each Scorza variety and its secant varieties in the ambient projective space are identified, in the realm of singular Poisson-Kaehler geometry, in terms of projectivizations of holomorphic nilpotent orbits in suitable Lie algebras of hermitian type, the holomorphic nilpotent orbits, in turn, being affine varieties. The ambient projective space acquires an exotic Kaehler structure, the closed stratum being the Scorza variety and the closures of the higher strata its secant varieties. In this fashion, the secant varieties become exotic projective varieties. In the rank 3 case, the four regular Scorza varieties coincide with the four critical Severi varieties. In the standard cases, the Scorza varieties and their secant varieties arise also via Kaehler reduction.

Contact Geometry of Hyperbolic Equations of Generic Type,Dennis The,"We study the contact geometry of scalar second order hyperbolic equations in the plane of generic type. Following a derivation of parametrized contact-invariants to distinguish Monge-Ampere (class 6-6), Goursat (class 6-7) and generic (class 7-7) hyperbolic equations, we use Cartan's equivalence method to study the generic case. An intriguing feature of this class of equations is that every generic hyperbolic equation admits at most a nine-dimensional contact symmetry algebra. The nine-dimensional bound is sharp: normal forms for the contact-equivalence classes of these maximally symmetric generic hyperbolic equations are derived and explicit symmetry algebras are presented. Moreover, these maximally symmetric equations are Darboux integrable. An enumeration of several submaximally symmetric (eight and seven-dimensional) generic hyperbolic structures is also given.",2008-04-09T20:49:22Z,2008-08-19T06:27:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1559v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.1559v2,"math.DG, math-ph, math.AP, math.MP, 35A30, 35L70, 58J70"

We derive a dimension formula for the tropicalized model, and we use it to show that the restricted Boltzmann machine is identifiable in many cases.

D-branes and Azumaya noncommutative geometry: From Polchinski to   Grothendieck,"Chien-Hao Liu, Shing-Tung Yau","We review first Azumaya geometry and D-branes in the realm of algebraic geometry along the line of Polchinski-Grothendieck Ansatz from our earlier work and then use it as background to introduce Azumaya $C^{\infty}$-manifolds with a fundamental module and morphisms therefrom to a projective complex manifold. This gives us a description of D-branes of A-type. Donaldson's picture of Lagrangian and special Lagrangian submanifolds as selected from the zero-locus of a moment map on a related space of maps can be merged into the setting. As a pedagogical toy model, we study D-branes of A-type in a Calabi-Yau torus. Simple as it is, it reveals several features of D-branes, including their assembling/disassembling.

We will start with an outline of the idea of the new geometry, followed by some philosophical background behind this vision. Then we will review a working definition of CFT slightly modified from Segal's original definition and explain how VOA emerges from it naturally. Next, using the representation theory of rational VOAs, we will discuss a classification result of open-closed rational CFTs, from which some basic properties of a rational CFT, such as the Holographic Principle, can be derived. They will also serve as supporting evidences for the vision of a new geometry.

Under some natural assumptions on the subgroup $G$ and on the flags, one can pass from the filtered objects to the corresponding graded objects and describe the construction of canonical bundles of moving frames for these curves in the language of pure Linear Algebra. The scope of applicability of the theory includes geometry of natural classes of curves of flags with respect to reductive linear groups or their parabolic subgroups. As simplest examples, this includes the projective and affine geometry of curves.

We give a cohomological characterization of existence and unicity for homotopy co-moment maps and show its utility in multisymplectic geometry by applying it to special cases as exact multisymplectic manifolds and simple Lie groups and by deriving from it existence results concerning partial co-moment maps, as e.g. covariant multimomentum maps and multi-moment maps.",2014-11-09T21:49:05Z,2014-11-09T21:49:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2287v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2287v1,"math.DG, math-ph, math.MP"
Modular curvature for toric noncommutative manifolds,Yang Liu,"A general question behind this paper is to explore a good notion for intrinsic curvature in the framework of noncommutative geometry started by Alain Connes in the 80s. It has only recently begun (2014) to be comprehended via the intensive study of modular geometry on the noncommutative two tori. In this paper, we extend recent results on the modular geometry on noncommutative two tori to a larger class of noncommutative manifolds: toric noncommutative manifolds. The first contribution of this work is a pseudo differential calculus which is suitable for spectral geometry on toric noncommutative manifolds. As the main application, we derive a general expression for the modular curvature with respect to a conformal change of metric on toric noncommutative manifolds. By specializing our results to the noncommutative two and four tori, we recovered the modular curvature functions found in the previous works. An important technical aspect of the computation is that it is free of computer assistance.",2015-10-15T19:12:35Z,2016-06-25T04:15:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04668v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04668v2,"math.OA, math.DG, math.QA"
The Ricci Curvature in Noncommutative Geometry,"Remus Floricel, Asghar Ghorbanpour, Masoud Khalkhali","Motivated by the local formulae for asymptotic expansion of heat kernels in spectral geometry, we propose a definition of Ricci curvature in noncommutative settings. The Ricci operator of an oriented closed Riemannian manifold can be realized as a spectral functional, namely the functional defined by the zeta function of the full Laplacian of the de Rham complex, localized by smooth endomorphisms of the cotangent bundle and their trace. We use this formulation to introduce the Ricci functional in a noncommutative setting and in particular for curved noncommutative tori. This Ricci functional uniquely determines a density element, called the Ricci density, which plays the role of the Ricci operator. The main result of this paper provides an explicit computation of the Ricci density when the conformally flat geometry of the noncommutative two torus is encoded by the modular de Rham spectral triple.",2016-12-20T14:46:05Z,2017-12-16T19:50:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06688v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06688v2,"math.QA, math-ph, math.DG, math.MP, math.OA, math.SP, Primary: 58B34 Secondary: 46L87, 58J42"
O-minimal de Rham cohomology,"Ricardo Bianconi, Rodrigo Figueiredo","O-minimal geometry generalizes both semialgebraic and subanalytic geometries, and has been very successful in solving special cases of some problems in arithmetic geometry, such as Andr\'e-Oort conjecture. Among the many tools developed in an o-minimal setting are cohomology theories for abstract-definable continuous manifolds such as singular cohomology, sheaf cohomology and \v Cech cohomology, which have been used for instance to prove Pillay's conjecture concerning definably compact groups. In the present paper we elaborate an o-minimal de Rham cohomology theory for abstract-definable $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ manifolds in an o-minimal expansion of the real field which admits smooth cell decomposition and defines the exponential function. We can specify the o-minimal cohomology groups and attain some properties such as the existence of Mayer-Vietoris sequence and the invariance under abstract-definable $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ diffeomorphisms. However, in order to obtain the invariance of our o-minimal cohomology under abstract-definable homotopy we must, working in a tame context that defines sufficiently many primitives, assume the validity of a statement related to Br\""ocker's question.",2019-04-11T00:16:21Z,2019-06-11T04:09:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05485v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05485v2,"math.LO, math.AG, math.AT, math.DG, 03C64, 14C30, 14F25, 14P15, 57N65, 58A12"
