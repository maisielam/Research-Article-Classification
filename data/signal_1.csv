Spectral remapping of natural signals,Md. Shoaibur Rahman,"Here we present an algorithm to procedurally remap spectral contents of natural signals. The algorithm takes in two inputs: a signal whose spectral component needs to be remapped and a warping or remapping function. The algorithm generates one output, which is a remapped version of the original signal. The input signal is remapped into the output signal in two steps. In the analysis step, the algorithm performs a series of operations to modify the spectral content, i.e., compute the warped phase of the signal according to the given remapping function. In the synthesis step, the modified spectral content is combined with the envelope information of the input signal to reconstruct the warped or remapped output signal.",2019-12-22T02:05:35Z,2019-12-22T02:05:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10371v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10371v1,eess.SP
To further understand graph signals,"Feng Ji, Wee Peng Tay","Graph signal processing (GSP) is a framework to analyze and process graph-structured data. Many research works focus on developing tools such as Graph Fourier transforms (GFT), filters, and neural network models to handle graph signals. Such approaches have successfully taken care of ``signal processing'' in many circumstances. In this paper, we want to put emphasis on ``graph signals'' themselves. Although there are characterizations of graph signals using the notion of bandwidth derived from GFT, we want to argue here that graph signals may contain hidden geometric information of the network, independent of (graph) Fourier theories. We shall provide a framework to understand such information, and demonstrate how new knowledge on ``graph signals'' can help with ``signal processing''.",2022-03-02T02:52:15Z,2023-03-10T02:55:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00832v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00832v2,eess.SP
Topological Signal Processing over Simplicial Complexes,"Sergio Barbarossa, Stefania Sardellitti","The goal of this paper is to establish the fundamental tools to analyze signals defined over a topological space, i.e. a set of points along with a set of neighborhood relations. This setup does not require the definition of a metric and then it is especially useful to deal with signals defined over non-metric spaces. We focus on signals defined over simplicial complexes. Graph Signal Processing (GSP) represents a special case of Topological Signal Processing (TSP), referring to the situation where the signals are associated only with the vertices of a graph. Even though the theory can be applied to signals of any order, we focus on signals defined over the edges of a graph and show how building a simplicial complex of order two, i.e. including triangles, yields benefits in the analysis of edge signals. After reviewing the basic principles of algebraic topology, we derive a sampling theory for signals of any order and emphasize the interplay between signals of different order. Then we propose a method to infer the topology of a simplicial complex from data. We conclude with applications to real edge signals and to the analysis of discrete vector fields to illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodologies.",2019-07-26T13:50:01Z,2020-03-13T13:48:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11577v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11577v2,eess.SP
Signal denoising based on the Schr√∂dinger operator's eigenspectrum and   a curvature constraint,"Peihao Li, Taous Meriem Laleg-Kirati","Recently, a new Signal processing method, named Semi-Classical Signal Analysis (SCSA), has been proposed for denoising Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) signals. It is based on the Schr\""odinger Operator's eigenspectrum. It allows an efficient noise reduction while preserving MRS signal's peaks. In this paper, we propose to extend this approach to different signals, in particular pulse shaped signals, by including an optimization that considers curvature constraints. The performance of the method is measured by analyzing noisy signal data and comparing with other denoising methods. Results indicate that the proposed method not only produces good denoising performance but also guarantees the peaks are well preserved in the denoising process.",2019-08-21T09:22:52Z,2019-08-21T09:22:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07758v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07758v1,eess.SP
Recovery of Graph Signals from Sign Measurements,"Wenwei Liu, Hui Feng, Kaixuan Wang, Feng Ji, Bo Hu","Sampling and interpolation have been extensively studied, in order to reconstruct or estimate the entire graph signal from the signal values on a subset of vertexes, of which most achievements are about continuous signals. While in a lot of signal processing tasks, signals are not fully observed, and only the signs of signals are available, for example a rating system may only provide several simple options. In this paper, the reconstruction of band-limited graph signals based on sign sampling is discussed and a greedy sampling strategy is proposed. The simulation experiments are presented, and the greedy sampling algorithm is compared with random sampling algorithm, which verify the validity of the proposed approach.",2021-09-26T12:00:55Z,2021-09-26T12:00:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12576v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12576v1,eess.SP
Modelling Underwater Acoustic Propagation using One-way Wave Equations,Indrakshi Dey,"The primary contribution of this paper is to characterize the propagation of acoustic signal carrying information through any medium and the interaction of the travelling acoustic signal with the surrounding medium. We will use the concept of damped harmonic oscillator to model the medium and Milne's oscillator technique to map the interaction of the acoustic signal with the medium. The acoustic signal itself will be modelled using the one-way wave equation formulated in terms of acoustic pressure and velocity of acoustic waves through the medium. Using the above-mentioned concepts, we calculated the effective signal strength, phase shift and time period of the communicated signal. Numerical results are generated to present the evolution of signal strength and received signal envelope in underwater environment.",2022-02-14T08:58:46Z,2022-02-14T08:58:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06559v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06559v1,eess.SP

Towards bandwidth estimation for graph signal reconstruction,"Ajinkya Jayawant, Antonio Ortega","In numerous graph signal processing applications, data is often missing for a variety of reasons, and predicting the missing data is essential. In this paper, we consider data on graphs modeled as bandlimited graph signals. Predicting or reconstructing the unknown signal values for such a model requires an estimate of the signal bandwidth. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the reconstruction errors, minimizing which would thereby provide an estimate of the signal bandwidth. In doing so, we design a cross-validation approach needed for stable graph signal reconstruction and propose a method for estimating the reconstruction errors for different choices of signal bandwidth. Using this technique, we are able to estimate the reconstruction error on a variety of real-world graphs.",2023-03-12T08:27:11Z,2023-03-12T08:27:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06608v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06608v1,eess.SP
Low-Complexity Signal Detection for the Splitting Receiver Scheme,"Yanyan Wang, Qidi Li, Xiaohu Tang","This letter proposes a low-complexity signal detection method for the splitting receiver scheme, which achieves an excellent symbol error rate (SER) performance. Based on the three-dimensional (3D) received signal of the splitting receiver, we derive an equivalent two-dimensional (2D) signal model and develop a low-complexity signal detection method for the practical modulation scheme. The computational complexity of the proposed signal detector is reduced by at least 11.1 times as compared to the 3D signal detection scheme shown in [1].

Abnormal Signal Recognition with Time-Frequency Spectrogram: A Deep   Learning Approach,"Tingyan Kuang, Huichao Chen, Lu Han, Rong He, Wei Wang, Guoru Ding","With the increasingly complex and changeable electromagnetic environment, wireless communication systems are facing jamming and abnormal signal injection, which significantly affects the normal operation of a communication system. In particular, the abnormal signals may emulate the normal signals, which makes it very challenging for abnormal signal recognition. In this paper, we propose a new abnormal signal recognition scheme, which combines time-frequency analysis with deep learning to effectively identify synthetic abnormal communication signals. Firstly, we emulate synthetic abnormal communication signals including seven jamming patterns. Then, we model an abnormal communication signals recognition system based on the communication protocol between the transmitter and the receiver. To improve the performance, we convert the original signal into the time-frequency spectrogram to develop an image classification algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recognize the abnormal signals under various parameter configurations, even under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low jamming-to-signal ratio (JSR) conditions.",2022-05-30T11:29:28Z,2022-05-30T11:29:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15001v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15001v1,eess.SP
Time-varying microwave photonic filter for arbitrary waveform   signal-to-noise ratio improvement,"Dong Ma, Yang Chen","A time-varying microwave photonic filter (TV-MPF) based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is proposed and utilized to suppress the in-band noise of broadband arbitrary microwave waveforms, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The filter-controlling signal is designed according to the signal to be filtered and drives the TV-MPF so that the passband of the filter is always aligned with the frequencies of the signal to be filtered. By continuously tracking the signal spectral component, the TV-MPF only retains the spectral components of the signal and filters out the noise other than the spectral component of the signal at the current time, so as to improve the in-band SNR of the signal to be filtered. An experiment is performed. A variety of signals with different formats and in-band SNRs are used to test the noise suppression capability of the TV-MPF, and the waveform mean-square error is calculated to quantify the improvement of the signal, demonstrating the excellent adaptability of the proposed TV-MPF to different kinds of signals.",2022-01-27T02:34:37Z,2022-01-27T02:34:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11285v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11285v1,eess.SP
Authentication of Satellite Navigation Signals by Wiretap Coding and   Artificial Noise,"Francesco Formaggio, Stefano Tomasin","In order to combat the spoofing of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals we propose a novel approach for satellite signal authentication based on information-theoretic security. In particular we superimpose to the navigation signal an authentication signal containing a secret message corrupted by artificial noise (AN), still transmitted by the satellite. We impose the following properties: a) the authentication signal is synchronous with the navigation signal, b) the authentication signal is orthogonal to the navigation signal and c) the secret message is undecodable by the attacker due to the presence of the AN. The legitimate receiver synchronizes with the navigation signal and stores the samples of the authentication signal with the same synchronization. After the transmission of the authentication signal, through a separate public asynchronous authenticated channel (e.g., a secure Internet connection) additional information is made public allowing the receiver to a) decode the secret message, thus overcoming the effects of AN, and b) verify the secret message. We assess the performance of the proposed scheme by the analysis of both the secrecy capacity of the authentication message and the attack success probability, under various attack scenarios. A comparison with existing approaches shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",2018-02-13T09:14:11Z,2018-04-18T12:17:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04513v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04513v2,eess.SP
Local damage detection in rolling element bearings based on a Single   Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition,"Yaakoub Berrouche, Govind Vashishtha, Sumika Chauhan, Radoslaw Zimroz","A Single Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (SEEMD) is proposed for locating the damage in rolling element bearings. The SEEMD does not require a number of ensembles from the addition or subtraction of noise every time while processing the signals. The SEEMD requires just a single sifting process of a modified raw signal to reduce the computation time significantly. The other advantage of the SEEMD method is its success in dealing with non-Gaussian or non-stationary perturbing signals. In SEEMD, initially, a fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) is added to the raw signal to emphasize on high frequencies of the signal. Then, a convoluted white Gaussian noise is multiplied to the resulting signal which changes the spectral content of the signal which helps in extraction of the weak periodic signal. Finally, the obtained signal is decomposed by using a single sifting process. The proposed methodology is applied to the raw signals obtained from the mining industry. These signals are difficult to analyze since cyclic impulsive components are obscured by noise and other interference. Based on the results, the proposed method can effectively detect the fault where the signal of interest (SOI) has been extracted with good quality.",2025-02-12T12:56:33Z,2025-02-12T12:56:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08368v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08368v1,eess.SP

On Lossless Causal Compression of Periodic Signals,"Jan Maximilian Montenbruck, Shen Zeng","We present and study a scheme for lossless causal compression of periodic real-valued signals. In particular, our technique compresses a vector-valued signal to a scalar-valued signal by mixing it with another periodic signal. The conditions for being able to reconstruct the original signal then amount to certain non-resonances between the periods of the two signals.

Blind separation of rotor vibration signals in high-noise environments,"Pengfei Xu, Yinjie Jia, Zhijian Wang","During the operation of the engine rotor, the vibration signal measured by the sensor is the mixed signal of each vibration source, and contains strong noise at the same time. In this paper, a new separation method for mixed vibration signals in strong noise environment(SNR=-5) is proposed. Firstly, the time-delay auto-correlation de-noising method is used to de-noise the mixed signals, and then the common blind separation algorithm (MSNR algorithm is used here) is used to separate the mixed vibration signals, which improves the separation performance. The simulation results verify the validity of the method.

Analysis of Seismocardiographic Signals Using Polynomial Chirplet   Transform and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution,"Amirtaha Taebi, Hansen A Mansy","Seismocardiographic (SCG) signals are chest surface vibrations induced by cardiac activity. These signals may offer a method for diagnosing and monitoring heart function. Successful classification of SCG signals in health and disease depends on accurate signal characterization and feature extraction. One approach of determining signal features is to estimate its time-frequency characteristics. In this regard, four different time-frequency distribution (TFD) approaches were used including short-time Fourier transform (STFT), polynomial chirplet transform (PCT), Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), and smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD). Synthetic SCG signals with known time-frequency properties were generated and used to evaluate the accuracy of the different TFDs in extracting SCG spectral characteristics. Using different TFDs, the instantaneous frequency (IF) of each synthetic signal was determined and the error (NRMSE) in estimating IF was calculated. STFT had lower NRMSE than WVD for synthetic signals considered. PCT and SPWVD were, however, more accurate IF estimators especially for the signal with time-varying frequencies. PCT and SPWVD also provided better discrimination between signal frequency components. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that PCT and SPWVD would be more reliable methods for estimating IF of SCG signals. Analysis of actual SCG signals showed that these signals had multiple spectral components with slightly time-varying frequencies. More studies are needed to investigate SCG spectral properties for healthy subjects as well as patients with different cardiac conditions.",2017-11-29T22:42:46Z,2017-11-29T22:42:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11138v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11138v1,eess.SP
On the Impact of Unknown Signals in Passive Radar with Direct Path and   Reflected Path Observations,"Yicheng Chen, Rick S. Blum","We derive the closed form Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) expressions for joint estimation of time delay and Doppler shift with unknown signals with possibly known structure. The results are especially useful for passive radar where direct path and reflected path signals are present. Time delay and Doppler shift estimation is an important fundamental tool in signal processing which has received extensive study for cases with known transmitted signals, but little study for unknown transmitted signals. The presented results generalize previous results for known transmitted signals and show how many looks from the direct path and the reflected path we need to derive an accurate joint estimation of time delay and Doppler shift. After analysis under a simple common signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) model with separated direct and reflected path signals, white clutter-plus-noise and line of sight propagation, extensions to cases with different direct and reflected path SCNRs, correlated clutter-plus-noise, nonseparated direct and reflected path signals and multipath propagation are discussed to support the utility of the CRB with unknown signals.",2018-05-03T20:57:59Z,2018-05-03T20:57:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01533v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01533v1,eess.SP
Folded Graph Signals: Sensing with Unlimited Dynamic Range,"Feng Ji, Pratibha, Wee Peng Tay","Self-reset analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used to sample high dynamic range signals resulting in modulo-operation based folded signal samples. We consider the case where each vertex of a graph (e.g., sensors in a network) is equipped with a self-reset ADC and senses a time series. Graph sampling allows the graph time series to be represented by the signals at a subset of sampled vertices and time instances. We investigate the problem of recovering bandlimited continuous-time graph signals from folded signal samples. We derive sufficient conditions to achieve successful recovery of the graph signal from the folded signal samples, which can be achieved via integer programming. To resolve the scalability issue of integer programming, we propose a sparse optimization recovery method for graph signals satisfying certain technical conditions. Such an approach requires a novel graph sampling scheme that selects vertices with small signal variation. The proposed algorithm exploits the inherent relationship among the graph vertices in both the vertex and time domains to recover the graph signal. Simulations and experiments on images validate the feasibility of our proposed approach.",2019-03-09T05:41:53Z,2020-01-20T04:30:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03741v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03741v2,eess.SP

Digital-assisted photonic analog wideband multipath self-interference   cancellation,"Moxuan Han, Taixia Shi, Yang Chen","A digital-assisted photonic analog wideband radio-frequency multipath self-interference cancellation (SIC) and frequency downconversion method based on a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator and the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is proposed and demonstrated for in-band full-duplex systems. Besides the reference for the direct-path self-interference (SI) signal, the RLS algorithm is used to construct another reference for the residual SI signal from the direct path and the SI signals from the reflection paths. The proposed method can solve the performance limitation in the previously reported SIC methods of constructing the multipath SI signal using a single reference caused by the limited dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converter when the direct-path SI signal is much stronger than the sub-weak reflection-path SI signals. An experiment is performed. When the carrier frequency of the multipath SI signal is 10 GHz and the direct-path SI signal is much stronger than the sub-weak multipath SI signal, the cancellation depths of about 26.7 and 26.1 dB are realized with SI baud rates of 0.5 and 1 Gbaud.

An Energy-concentrated Wavelet Transform for Time Frequency Analysis of   Transient Signals,"Haoran Dong, Gang Yu","Transient signals are often composed of a series of modes that have multivalued time-dependent instantaneous frequency (IF), which brings challenges to the development of signal processing technology. Fortunately, the group delay (GD) of such signal can be well expressed as a single valued function of frequency. By considering the frequency-domain signal model, we present a postprocessing method called wavelet transform (WT)-based time-reassigned synchrosqueezing transform (WTSST). Our proposed method embeds a two-dimensional GD operator into a synchrosqueezing framework to generate a time-frequency representation (TFR) of transient signal with high energy concentration and allows to retrieve the whole or part of the signal. The theoretical analyses of the WTSST are provided, including the analysis of GD candidate accuracy and signal reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, based on WTSST, the WT-based time-reassigned multisynchrosqueezing transform (WTMSST) is proposed by introducing a stepwise refinement scheme, which further improves the drawback that the WTSST method is unable to deal with strong frequency-varying signal.

A New Radar Signal Multiparameter-Based Deinterleaving Method,"Wang Chao, Liu Weisong, Li Xueqiong, Wang Xiang, Huang Zhitao","Radar signal deinterleaving has been extensively and thoroughly investigated in the electronic reconnaissance field. In this work, a new radar signal multiparameter-based deinterleaving method is proposed. In this method, semantic information composed of the pulse repetition interval (PRI), pulse width (PW), radio frequency (RF), and pulse amplitude (PA) of a radar signal is used to deinterleave radar signals. A bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) is employed, and the difference of time of arrival (DTOA)/RF, DTOA/PW, and DTOA/PA of the pulse stream are input into the BGRU. Based on the semantic information contained in different radar signal types, each pulse in the obtained pulse stream is classified according to the semantic information category, and the radar signals are deinterleaved. Compared to the PRI-based deinterleaving methods, the proposed method utilizes the multidimensional information of radar signals. As a result, higher deinterleaving accuracy is achieved. Compared to other existing radar signal multiparameter-based deinterleaving methods, the proposed method can adapt to radar signals with complex parameter features as well as to complex signal environments, and can complete the use of multiparameter in one step.",2022-08-21T03:05:57Z,2022-08-21T03:05:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09786v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09786v1,eess.SP

Runaway signals: Exaggerated displays of commitment may result from   second-order signaling,"Julien Lie-Panis, Jean-Louis Dessalles","To demonstrate their commitment, for instance during wartime, members of a group will sometimes all engage in the same ruinous display. Such uniform, high-cost signals are hard to reconcile with standard models of signaling. For signals to be stable, they should honestly inform their audience; yet, uniform signals are trivially uninformative. To explain this phenomenon, we design a simple model, which we call the signal runaway game. In this game, senders can express outrage at non-senders. Outrage functions as a second-order signal. By expressing outrage at non-senders, senders draw attention to their own signal, and benefit from its increased visibility. Using our model and a simulation, we show that outrage can stabilize uniform signals, and can lead signal costs to run away. Second-order signaling may explain why groups sometimes demand displays of commitment from all their members, and why these displays can entail extreme costs.",2023-01-09T14:44:45Z,2023-08-09T08:08:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03388v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03388v2,q-bio.PE
On distributional graph signals,"Feng Ji, Xingchao Jian, Wee Peng Tay","Graph signal processing (GSP) studies graph-structured data, where the central concept is the vector space of graph signals. To study a vector space, we have many useful tools up our sleeves. However, uncertainty is omnipresent in practice, and using a vector to model a real signal can be erroneous in some situations. In this paper, we want to use the Wasserstein space as a replacement for the vector space of graph signals, to account for signal stochasticity. The Wasserstein is strictly more general in which the classical graph signal space embeds isometrically. An element in the Wasserstein space is called a distributional graph signal. On the other hand, signal processing for a probability space of graphs has been proposed in the literature.

One Signal-Noise Separation based Wiener Filter for Magnetogastrogram,Hua Li,"Magnetogastrogram (MGG) signal frequency is about 0.05 Hz, the low-frequency environmental noise interference is serious and can be several times stronger in magnitude than the signals of interest and may severely impede the extraction of relevant information. Wiener filter is one classic denoising solution for biomagnetic applications. Since the reference channels are usually placed not far enough from the biomagnetic sources under test, they will inevitably detect the signals and the Wiener filters may produce ill-conditioned solutions. Considering the solutions to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Wiener filter output, there are few methods to separate the signals from the noises of the reference signal at the filter input. In this paper, a new signal processing framework called signal-noise separation based Wiener filter (SNSWF) is proposed that it separates the main noise as the input signal of the filter to improve the output SNR of Wiener filter. The filter was successfully applied to the noise suppression for MGG signal detection. Using the SNSWF, the filter SNR is 16.7 dB better than the classic Wiener filter.",2023-11-12T05:30:48Z,2023-11-12T05:30:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06739v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06739v1,eess.SP
Sparsity-Assisted Signal Denoising and Pattern Recognition in   Time-Series Data,"G. V. Prateek, Yo-El Ju, Arye Nehorai","We address the problem of signal denoising and pattern recognition in processing batch-mode time-series data by combining linear time-invariant filters, orthogonal multiresolution representations, and sparsity-based methods. We propose a novel approach to designing higher-order zero-phase low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass infinite impulse response filters as matrices, using spectral transformation of the state-space representation of digital filters. We also propose a proximal gradient-based technique to factorize a special class of zero-phase high-pass and band-pass digital filters so that the factorization product preserves the zero-phase property of the filter and also incorporates a sparse-derivative component of the input in the signal model. To demonstrate applications of our novel filter designs, we validate and propose new signal models to simultaneously denoise and identify patterns of interest. We begin by using our proposed filter design to test an existing signal model that simultaneously combines linear time invariant (LTI) filters and sparsity-based methods. We develop a new signal model called sparsity-assisted signal denoising (SASD) by combining our proposed filter designs with the existing signal model. Thereafter, we propose and derive a new signal model called sparsity-assisted pattern recognition (SAPR). In SAPR, we combine LTI band-pass filters and sparsity-based methods with orthogonal multiresolution representations, such as wavelets, to detect specific patterns in the input signal. Finally, we combine the signal denoising and pattern recognition tasks, and derive a new signal model called the sparsity-assisted signal denoising and pattern recognition (SASDPR). We illustrate the capabilities of the SAPR and SASDPR frameworks using sleep-electroencephalography data to detect K-complexes and sleep spindles, respectively.",2019-06-26T20:20:12Z,2019-06-26T20:20:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11330v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11330v1,eess.SP
Photonics-based de-chirping and leakage cancellation for   frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar system,"Taixia Shi, Dingding Liang, Moxuan Han, Yang Chen","A photonics-based leakage cancellation and echo signal de-chirping approach for frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar systems is proposed based on a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DD-MZM), with its performance evaluated by the radar measurement and imaging. The de-chirp reference signal and the leakage cancellation reference signal are combined and applied to the upper arm of the DD-MZM, while the received signal including the leakage signal and echo signals is applied to the lower arm of the DD-MZM. When the amplitudes and delays of the leakage cancellation reference signal and the leakage signal are precisely matched and the DD-MZM is biased at the minimum transmission point, the leakage signal is canceled in the optical domain. The de-chirped signals are obtained after the leakage-free optical signal is detected in a photodetector. An experiment is performed. The cancellation depth of the de-chirped leakage signal is around 23 dB when the center frequency and bandwidth of the linearly frequency-modulated signal are 11.5 and 2 GHz. The leakage cancellation scheme is used in a radar system. When the leakage cancellation is not employed, the leakage signal will seriously affect the imaging results and distance measurement accuracy of the radar system. When the leakage cancellation is applied, the imaging results of multiple targets can be clearly distinguished, and the error of the distance measurement results is significantly reduced to 10 cm.",2021-11-12T09:36:46Z,2021-11-12T09:36:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06622v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06622v1,eess.SP
Direct Signal Separation Via Extraction of Local Frequencies with   Adaptive Time-Varying Parameters,"Lin Li, Charles K. Chui, Qingtang Jiang","Real-world phenomena that can be formulated as signals are often affected by a number of factors and appear as multi-component modes. To understand and process such phenomena, ""divide-and-conquer"" is probably the most common strategy to address the problem. In other words, the captured signal is decomposed into signal components for each individual component to be processed. Unfortunately, for signals that are superimposition of non-stationary amplitude-frequency modulated (AM-FM) components, the ""divide-and-conquer"" strategy is bound to fail, since there is no way to be sure that the decomposed components take on the AM-FM formulations which are necessary for the extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and amplitudes (IAs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive signal separation operation (ASSO) for effective and accurate separation of a single-channel blind-source multi-component signal, via introducing a time-varying parameter that adapts locally to IFs and using linear chirp (linear frequency modulation) signals to approximate components at each time instant. We derive more accurate component recovery formulae based on the linear chirp signal local approximation. In addition, a recovery scheme, together with a ridge detection method, is also proposed to extract the signal components one by one, and the time-varying parameter is updated for each component. The proposed method is suitable for engineering implementation, being capable of separating complicated signals into their components or sub-signals and reconstructing the signal trend directly. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world signals are presented to demonstrate our improvement over the previous attempts.",2020-10-05T09:01:52Z,2022-05-26T19:18:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01866v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01866v2,eess.SP
Tensor Low Rank Modeling and Its Applications in Signal Processing,"Baburaj Madathil, Sameera V Mohd Sagheer, Abdu Rahiman V, Anju Jose Tom, Baiju P S, Jobin Francis, Sudhish N. George","Modeling of multidimensional signal using tensor is more convincing than representing it as a collection of matrices. The tensor based approaches can explore the abundant spatial and temporal structures of the mutlidimensional signal. The backbone of this modeling is the mathematical foundations of tensor algebra. The linear transform based tensor algebra furnishes low complex and high performance algebraic structures suitable for the introspection of the multidimensional signal. A comprehensive introduction of the linear transform based tensor algebra is provided from the signal processing viewpoint. The rank of a multidimensional signal is a precious property which gives an insight into the structural aspects of it. All natural multidimensional signals can be approximated to a low rank signal without losing significant information. The low rank approximation is beneficial in many signal processing applications such as denoising, missing sample estimation, resolution enhancement, classification, background estimation, object detection, deweathering, clustering and much more applications. Detailed case study of the ways and means of the low rank modeling in the above said signal processing applications are also presented.",2019-12-07T04:27:35Z,2019-12-07T04:27:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03435v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03435v1,eess.SP
eSampling: Rethinking Sampling with Energy Harvesting,"Neha Jain, Bhawna Tiwari, Anubha Gupta, Vivek Ashok Bohara, Pydi Ganga Bahubalindruni","In general, real world signals are analog in nature. To capture these signals for further processing, or transmission, signals are converted into digital bits using analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In this conversion, a good amount of signal energy is wasted because signal that is captured within the sampling duration is utilized, while rest of the signal waveform is discarded. In this context, this paper revisits the sampling process and proposes to utilize this discarded signal for energy harvesting, naming the method as eSampling, i.e., sampling with energy harvesting. The proposed idea of \textit{eSampling} is demonstrated via modifying the circuitry of the hold phase of ADC. The system is designed using standard Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) 65 nm technology and simulations are performed on Cadence Virtuoso platform with input signal at different frequencies (100 Hz and 40 MHz). These results show that 10\% of the sampling period is sufficient to sample the input analog signal, while the remaining 90\% can be used for harvesting the energy from the input analog signal. In order to validate eSampling for practical scenarios, results with hardware setup have also been added.",2019-12-07T07:26:47Z,2019-12-07T07:26:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03453v1,eess.SP
Subgraph Signal Processing,"Feng Ji, Wee Peng Tay, Giacomo Kahn","Graph signal processing, like the graph Fourier transform, requires the full graph signal at every vertex of the graph. However, in practice, only signals at a subset of vertices may be available. We propose a subgraph signal processing framework that relates a graph shift operator or filter on a subgraph with a filter on the ambient graph through an operator loss. It allows us to define shift operators for the subgraph signal, which has a meaningful interpretation and relation to mixtures of shift invariant filters restricted to different subgraphs of the ambient graph (which we call semi shift invariant). This leads to a notion of frequency domain for the subgraph signal consistent in some sense with that of the full graph signal. We apply the subgraph signal processing machinery to several applications and demonstrate the utility of this framework in cases where only partial graph signals are observed.",2020-05-11T03:52:28Z,2021-02-05T08:29:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04851v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04851v3,eess.SP
Defining Fundamental Frequency for Almost Harmonic Signals,"Filip Elvander, Andreas Jakobsson","In this work, we consider the modeling of signals that are almost, but not quite, harmonic, i.e., composed of sinusoids whose frequencies are close to being integer multiples of a common frequency. Typically, in applications, such signals are treated as perfectly harmonic, allowing for the estimation of their fundamental frequency, despite the signals not actually being periodic. Herein, we provide three different definitions of a concept of fundamental frequency for such inharmonic signals and study the implications of the different choices for modeling and estimation. We show that one of the definitions corresponds to a misspecified modeling scenario, and provides a theoretical benchmark for analyzing the behavior of estimators derived under a perfectly harmonic assumption. The second definition stems from optimal mass transport theory and yields a robust and easily interpretable concept of fundamental frequency based on the signals' spectral properties. The third definition interprets the inharmonic signal as an observation of a randomly perturbed harmonic signal. This allows for computing a hybrid information theoretical bound on estimation performance, as well as for finding an estimator attaining the bound. The theoretical findings are illustrated using numerical examples.",2020-03-24T11:01:57Z,2020-10-30T11:44:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10767v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10767v2,eess.SP

Modulation and Classification of Mixed Signals Based on Deep Learning,"Jiahao Xu, Zihuai Lin","With the rapid development of information nowadays, spectrum resources are becoming more and more scarce, leading to a shift in the research direction from the modulation classification of a single signal to the modulation classification of multiple signals on the same channel. Therefore, the emergence of an effective mixed signals automatic modulation classification technology have important significance. Considering that NOMA technology has deeper requirements for the modulation classification of mixed signals under different power, this paper mainly introduces and uses a variety of deep learning networks to classify such mixed signals. First, the modulation classification of a single signal based on the existing CNN model is reproduced. We then develop new methods to improve the basic CNN structure and apply it to the modulation classification of mixed signals. Meanwhile, the effects of the number of training sets, the type of training sets and the training methods on the recognition accuracy of mixed signals are studied. Second, we investigate some deep learning models based on CNN (ResNet34, hierarchical structure) and other deep learning models (LSTM, CLDNN). It can be seen although the time and space complexity of these algorithms have increased, different deep learning models have different effects on the modulation classification problem of mixed signals at different power. Generally speaking, higher accuracy gains can be achieved.",2022-05-20T01:09:56Z,2022-05-20T01:09:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09916v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09916v1,eess.SP
Synchro-Transient-Extracting Transform for the Analysis of Signals with   Both Harmonic and Impulsive Components,"Yunlong Ma, Gang Yu, Tianran Lin, Qingtang Jiang","Time-frequency analysis (TFA) techniques play an important role in the field of machine fault diagnosis attributing to their superiority in dealing with nonstationary signals. Synchroextracting transform (SET) and transient-extracting transform (TET) are two newly emerging techniques that can produce energy concentrated representation for nonstationary signals. However, SET and TET are only suitable for processing harmonic signals and impulsive signals, respectively. This poses a challenge for each of these two techniques when a signal contains both harmonic and impulsive components. In this paper, we propose a new TFA technique to solve this problem. The technique first divides time-frequency (TF) coefficients into two types according to the chirp rate of the signal, and then TF ridges are respectively extracted to prevent the limitation for the independent use of SET and TET. This allows the technique to generate an energy-concentrated TF representation for both harmonics and impulses in the signal. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed technique retains the signal reconstruction capability. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified using numerical and real-world signals.",2023-06-02T07:43:40Z,2024-02-08T00:45:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01320v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01320v2,eess.SP
A Geometric Algebra Framework for a Multidimensional Analytic Signal,K. James Sangston,"This work examines the problem of extending the one-dimensional analytic signal, which is ubiquitous throughout signal processing, to higher dimensional signals. Bulow et al. and Felsberg et al. have previously used techniques from Clifford algebra and analysis to extend the one-dimensional analytic signal to higher dimensions. However, each author sets forth a different definition of a multidimensional analytic signal. Herein we follow an observation of Brackx et al. and adopt a general definition of an analytic signal that encompasses both the hypercomplex signal of Bulow et al. and the monogenic signal of Felsberg et al. within the same mathematical framework. The crux of our approach is captured by the following statement: A multidimensional analytic signal is generated by an idempotent.

Robust correlation measures for informative frequency band selection in   heavy-tailed vibration signal,"Justyna Hebda-Sobkowicz, Rados≈Çaw Zimroz, Anil Kumar, Agnieszka Wy≈Çomanska","Vibration signals are commonly used to detect local damage in rotating machinery. However, raw signals are often noisy, particularly in crusher machines, where the technological process (falling pieces of rock) generates random impulses that complicate detection. To address this, signal pre-filtering (extracting the informative frequency band from noise-affected signals) is necessary. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing vibration signals from a bearing used in an ore crusher. Selecting informative frequency bands (IFBs) in the presence of impulsive noise is notably challenging. The approach employs correlation maps to detect cyclic behavior within specific frequency bands in the time-frequency domain (spectrogram), enabling the identification of IFBs. Robust correlation measures and median filtering are applied to enhance the correlation maps and improve the final IFB selection. Signal segmentation and the use of averaged results for IFB selection are also highlighted. The proposed trimmed and quadrant correlations are compablack with the Pearson and Kendall correlations using simulated signal, real vibration signal from crusher in mining industry and acoustic signal measublack on the test rig. Furthermore, the results of real vibration analyses are compablack with established IFB selectors, including the spectral kurtosis, the alpha selector and the conditional variance-based selector.",2025-02-16T16:36:06Z,2025-02-16T16:36:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11192v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11192v1,eess.SP

Multiplexing oscillatory biochemical signals,"Wiet de Ronde, Pieter Rein ten Wolde","In recent years it is increasingly being recognized that biochemical signals are not necessarily constant in time and that the temporal dynamics of a signal can be the information carrier. Moreover, it is now well established that components are often shared between signaling pathways. Here we show by mathematical modeling that living cells can multiplex a constant and an oscillatory signal: they can transmit these two signals through the same signaling pathway simultaneously, and yet respond to them specifically and reliably. We find that information transmission is reduced not only by noise arising from the intrinsic stochasticity of biochemical reactions, but also by crosstalk between the different channels. Yet, under biologically relevant conditions more than 2 bits of information can be transmitted per channel, even when the two signals are transmitted simultaneously.

In the sparse signal setting, most existing signal priors for GAMP assume the input signal to have i.i.d. entries.

Thus, there is the need to learn low dimensional representations for graph signals that will allow for data analysis and interpretation. Existing unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for graph signals have focused on dictionary learning. In these works the graph is taken into consideration by imposing a structure or a parametrization on the dictionary and the signals are represented as linear combinations of the atoms in the dictionary. However, the assumption that graph signals can be represented using linear combinations of atoms is not always appropriate.

Characterization and Mitigation of Sinusoidal Carrier Modulation Signals   by Short-Term Sinusoidal Analysis,S. W. Ellingson,"Most radio signals can be described as a form of sinusoidal carrier modulation. These signals have the property that when observed over a sufficiently short period of time, the waveform is approximately sinusoidal, exhibiting constant magnitude, frequency, and phase. When coherently digitized with sufficiently high sample rate, it is possible to discern this sinusoid. The associated signal can be represented as a sinusoid with time-varying frequency, magnitude, and phase. These parameters can subsequently be used for detection and characterization, including identification. The parameters can also be used to synthesize a noise-free estimate of the signal. The synthesized signal can be coherently subtracted from the original data in order to cancel the signal, nominally without distortion of the associated noise or nearby signals. In this report, the conditions required for the short-time sinusoidal approximation are described. Performance of the canceling technique is examined in the case of a VHF-band narrowband FM-modulated signal.",2020-04-07T18:46:07Z,2020-04-07T18:46:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03649v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03649v1,eess.SP

Here instead, we propose the graph modularity matrix as the centerpiece of GSP, in order to incorporate knowledge about graph community structure when processing signals on the graph, but without the need for community detection. We study this approach in several generic settings such as filtering, optimal sampling and reconstruction, surrogate data generation, and denoising. Feasibility is illustrated by a small-scale example and a transportation network dataset, as well as one application in human neuroimaging where community-aware GSP reveals relationships between behavior and brain features that are not shown by Laplacian-based GSP.

This paper provides a comprehensive and unifying view of several sampling, reconstruction, and recovery problems for signals defined on irregular domains that can be accurately represented by a graph. The workhorse assumption is that the (partially) observed signals can be modeled as the output of a graph filter to a structured (parsimonious) input graph signal. When either the input or the filter coefficients are known, this is tantamount to assuming that the signals of interest live on a subspace defined by the supporting graph. When neither is known, the model becomes bilinear. Upon imposing different priors and additional structure on either the input or the filter coefficients, a broad range of relevant problem formulations arise. The goal is then to leverage those priors, the shift operator of the supporting graph, and the samples of the signal of interest to recover: the signal at the non-sampled nodes (graph-signal interpolation), the input (deconvolution), the filter coefficients (system identification), or any combination thereof (blind deconvolution).",2021-05-31T07:25:46Z,2021-06-01T05:55:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14747v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14747v2,eess.SP
Exact Decomposition of Multifrequency Discrete Real and Complex Signals,BaoGuo Liu,"'The spectral leakage from windowing and the picket fence effect from discretization' have been among the standard contents in textbooks for many decades. The spectral leakage and picket fence effect would cause the distortions in amplitude, frequency, and phase of signals, which have always been of concern, and attempts have been made to solve them. This paper proposes two novel decomposition theorems that can totally eliminate the spectral leakage and picket fence effect, and could broaden the knowledge of signal processing. First, two generalized eigenvalue equations are constructed for multifrequency discrete real signals and complex signals. The two decomposition theorems are then proved. On these bases, exact decomposition methods for real and complex signals are proposed. For a noise-free multifrequency real signal with m sinusoidal components, the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each component can be exactly calculated by using just 4m-1 discrete values and its second-order derivatives. For a multifrequency complex signal, only 2m-1 discrete values and its first-order derivatives are needed. The numerical experiments show that the proposed methods have very high resolution, and the sampling rate does not necessarily obey the Nyquist sampling theorem. With noisy signals, the proposed methods have extraordinary accuracy.",2022-02-08T08:52:04Z,2022-02-08T08:52:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03722v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03722v1,eess.SP
Multi-channel Sampling on Graphs and Its Relationship to Graph Filter   Banks,"Junya Hara, Yuichi Tanaka","In this paper, we consider multi-channel sampling (MCS) for graph signals. We generally encounter full-band graph signals beyond the bandlimited one in many applications, such as piecewise constant/smooth and union of bandlimited graph signals. Full-band graph signals can be represented by a mixture of multiple signals conforming to different generation models. This requires the analysis of graph signals via multiple sampling systems, i.e., MCS, while existing approaches only consider single-channel sampling. We develop a MCS framework based on generalized sampling. We also present a sampling set selection (SSS) method for the proposed MCS so that the graph signal is best recovered. Furthermore, we reveal that existing graph filter banks can be viewed as a special case of the proposed MCS. In signal recovery experiments, the proposed method exhibits the effectiveness of recovery for full-band graph signals.",2022-11-04T06:57:31Z,2023-01-28T11:02:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02287v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02287v2,eess.SP
Deep Learning Architecture for Motor Imaged Words,"Vimal W, Akshansh Gupta","The notion of a Brain-Computer Interface system is the acquisition of signals from the brain, processing them, and translating them into commands. The study concentrated on a specific sort of brain signal known as Motor Imagery EEG signals, which are activated in the brain without any external stimulus of the needed motor activities in relation to the signal. The signals are further processed using complicated signal processing methods such as wavelet-based denoising and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based dimensionality reduction approach. To extract the characteristics from the processed data, both signal processing includes Short-Term Fourier Transforms (STFT) and a probabilistic approach such as Gramian Angular field Theory are used. Furthermore, the gathered feature signals are analyzed and converted into noteworthy commands by Deep Learning algorithms, which can be a mix of complicated Deep Learning algorithm families such as CNN and RNN.

AI Generated Signal for Wireless Sensing,"Hanxiang He, Han Hu, Xintao Huan, Heng Liu, Jianping An, Shiwen Mao","Deep learning has significantly advanced wireless sensing technology by leveraging substantial amounts of high-quality training data. However, collecting wireless sensing data encounters diverse challenges, including unavoidable data noise, limited data scale due to significant collection overhead, and the necessity to reacquire data in new environments. Taking inspiration from the achievements of AI-generated content, this paper introduces a signal generation method that achieves data denoising, augmentation, and synthesis by disentangling distinct attributes within the signal, such as individual and environment. The approach encompasses two pivotal modules: structured signal selection and signal disentanglement generation. Structured signal selection establishes a minimal signal set with the target attributes for subsequent attribute disentanglement. Signal disentanglement generation disentangles the target attributes and reassembles them to generate novel signals. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate data that closely resembles real-world data on two wireless sensing datasets, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance.

On Random Sampling of Diffused Graph Signals with Sparse Inputs on   Vertex Domain,"Yingcheng Lai, Li Chai, Jinming Xu","The sampling of graph signals has recently drawn much attention due to the wide applications of graph signal processing. While a lot of efficient methods and interesting results have been reported to the sampling of band-limited or smooth graph signals, few research has been devoted to non-smooth graph signals, especially to sparse graph signals, which are also of importance in many practical applications. This paper addresses the random sampling of non-smooth graph signals generated by diffusion of sparse inputs. We aim to present a solid theoretical analysis on the random sampling of diffused sparse graph signals, which can be parallel to that of band-limited graph signals, and thus present a sufficient condition to the number of samples ensuring the unique recovery for uniform random sampling. Then, we focus on two classes of widely used binary graph models, and give explicit and tighter estimations on the sampling numbers ensuring unique recovery. We also propose an adaptive variable-density sampling strategy to provide a better performance than uniform random sampling. Finally, simulation experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",2024-12-28T06:12:37Z,2024-12-28T06:12:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20041v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20041v1,eess.SP
Mutual information in time-varying biochemical systems,"Filipe Tostevin, Pieter Rein ten Wolde","Cells must continuously sense and respond to time-varying environmental stimuli. These signals are transmitted and processed by biochemical signalling networks. However, the biochemical reactions making up these networks are intrinsically noisy, which limits the reliability of intracellular signalling. Here we use information theory to characterise the reliability of transmission of time-varying signals through elementary biochemical reactions in the presence of noise. We calculate the mutual information for both instantaneous measurements and trajectories of biochemical systems for a Gaussian model. Our results indicate that the same network can have radically different characteristics for the transmission of instantaneous signals and trajectories. For trajectories, the ability of a network to respond to changes in the input signal is determined by the timing of reaction events, and is independent of the correlation time of the output of the network. We also study how reliably signals on different time-scales can be transmitted by considering the frequency-dependent coherence and gain-to-noise ratio. We find that a detector that does not consume the ligand molecule upon detection can more reliably transmit slowly varying signals, while an absorbing detector can more reliably transmit rapidly varying signals. Furthermore, we find that while one reaction may more reliably transmit information than another when considered in isolation, when placed within a signalling cascade the relative performance of the two reactions can be reversed. This means that optimising signal transmission at a single level of a signalling cascade can reduce signalling performance for the cascade as a whole.",2010-02-23T09:14:43Z,2010-06-16T16:50:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4273v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.4273v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.SC"
Intentional Aliasing Method to Improve Sub-Nyquist Sampling System,"Jehyuk Jang, Sanghun Im, Heung-No Lee","A modulated wideband converter (MWC) has been introduced as a sub-Nyquist sampler that exploits a set of fast alternating pseudo random (PR) signals. Through parallel sampling branches, an MWC compresses a multiband spectrum by mixing it with PR signals in the time domain, and acquires its sub-Nyquist samples. Previously, the ratio of compression was fully dependent on the specifications of PR signals. That is, to further reduce the sampling rate without information loss, faster and longer-period PR signals were needed. However, the implementation of such PR signal generators results in high power consumption and large fabrication area. In this paper, we propose a novel aliased modulated wideband converter (AMWC), which can further reduce the sampling rate of MWC with fixed PR signals. The main idea is to induce intentional signal aliasing at the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In addition to the first spectral compression by the signal mixer, the intentional aliasing compresses the mixed spectrum once again. We demonstrate that AMWC reduces the number of sampling branches and the rate of ADC for lossless sub-Nyquist sampling without needing to upgrade the speed or period of PR signals. Conversely, for a given fixed number of sampling branches and sampling rate, AMWC improves the performance of signal reconstruction.",2017-10-17T07:58:23Z,2018-10-05T06:16:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06142v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06142v2,eess.SP
Atomic Filter: a Weak Form of Shift Operator for Graph Signals,"Lihua Yang, Qing Zhang, Qian Zhang, Chao Huang","The shift operation plays a crucial role in the classical signal processing. It is the generator of all the filters and the basic operation for time-frequency analysis, such as windowed Fourier transform and wavelet transform. With the rapid development of internet technology and big data science, a large amount of data are expressed as signals defined on graphs. In order to establish the theory of filtering, windowed Fourier transform and wavelet transform in the setting of graph signals, we need to extend the shift operation of classical signals to graph signals.   It is a fundamental problem since the vertex set of a graph is usually not a vector space and the addition operation cannot be defined on the vertex set of the graph. In this paper, based on our understanding on the core role of shift operation in classical signal processing we propose the concept of atomic filters, which can be viewed as a weak form of the shift operator for graph signals. Then, we study the conditions such that an atomic filter is norm-preserving, periodic, or real-preserving. The property of real-preserving holds naturally in the classical signal processing, but no the research has been reported on this topic in the graph signal setting. With these conditions we propose the concept of normal atomic filters for graph signals, which degenerates into the classical shift operator under mild conditions if the graph is circulant. Typical examples of graphs that have or have not normal atomic filters are given. Finally, as an application, atomic filters are utilized to construct time-frequency atoms which constitute a frame of the graph signal space.",2022-04-01T14:11:46Z,2022-04-01T14:11:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00457v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00457v1,eess.SP
A BeiDou Signal Acquisition Approach Using Variable Length Data   Accumulation based on Signal Delay and Multiplication,"Menghuan Yang, Hong Wu, Qiqi Wang, Yingxin Zhao, Zhiyang Liu","The secondary modulation with the NeumannHoffman code increases the possibility of bit sign transition. Unlike other GNSS signals, there is no pilot component for synchronization in BeiDou B1/B3 signals, which increases the complexity in acquisition. A previous study has shown that the delay and multiplication (DAM) method is able to eliminate the bit sign transition problem, but it only applies to pretty strong signals. In this paper, a DAM-based BeiDou signal acquisition approach, called variable length data accumulation (VLDA), is proposed to acquire weak satellite signals. Firstly, the performance of DAM method versus the different delays is analyzed. The DAM operation not only eliminates bit sign transition, but it also increases noise power. Secondly, long-term signal is periodically accumulated to improve signal intensity in order to acquire weak signals. While considering the Doppler frequency shift of ranging codes, the signal length must be compensated before accumulating long-term signal. Finally, the fast-Fourier-transform based parallel code phase algorithm are used for acquisition. The simulation results indicate that the proposed VLDA method has better acquisition sensitivity than traditional non-coherent integration method under the same calculation amount. The VLDA method only requires approximately 27.5% of calculations to achieve the same acquisition sensitivity (35 dBHz). What is more, the actual experimental results verify the feasibility of the VLDA method. It can be concluded that the proposed approach is an effective and feasible method for solving the bit sign transition problem.",2020-03-01T10:49:58Z,2020-03-01T10:49:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00459v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00459v1,eess.SP
Reconstruction of Time-varying Graph Signals via Sobolev Smoothness,"Jhony H. Giraldo, Arif Mahmood, Belmar Garcia-Garcia, Dorina Thanou, Thierry Bouwmans","Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is an emerging research field that extends the concepts of digital signal processing to graphs. GSP has numerous applications in different areas such as sensor networks, machine learning, and image processing. The sampling and reconstruction of static graph signals have played a central role in GSP. However, many real-world graph signals are inherently time-varying and the smoothness of the temporal differences of such graph signals may be used as a prior assumption. In the current work, we assume that the temporal differences of graph signals are smooth, and we introduce a novel algorithm based on the extension of a Sobolev smoothness function for the reconstruction of time-varying graph signals from discrete samples. We explore some theoretical aspects of the convergence rate of our Time-varying Graph signal Reconstruction via Sobolev Smoothness (GraphTRSS) algorithm by studying the condition number of the Hessian associated with our optimization problem. Our algorithm has the advantage of converging faster than other methods that are based on Laplacian operators without requiring expensive eigenvalue decomposition or matrix inversions. The proposed GraphTRSS is evaluated on several datasets including two COVID-19 datasets and it has outperformed many existing state-of-the-art methods for time-varying graph signal reconstruction.

Blind Deconvolution of Graph Signals: Robustness to Graph Perturbations,"Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos","We study blind deconvolution of signals defined on the nodes of an undirected graph. Although observations are bilinear functions of both unknowns, namely the forward convolutional filter coefficients and the graph signal input, a filter invertibility requirement along with input sparsity allow for an efficient linear programming reformulation. Unlike prior art that relied on perfect knowledge of the graph eigenbasis, here we derive stable recovery conditions in the presence of small graph perturbations. We also contribute a provably convergent robust algorithm, which alternates between blind deconvolution of graph signals and eigenbasis denoising in the Stiefel manifold.

From data towards knowledge: Revealing the architecture of signaling   systems by unifying knowledge mining and data mining of systematic   perturbation data,"Songjian Lu, Bo Jin, Ashley Cowart, Xinghua Lu","Genetic and pharmacological perturbation experiments, such as deleting a gene and monitoring gene expression responses, are powerful tools for studying cellular signal transduction pathways. However, it remains a challenge to automatically derive knowledge of a cellular signaling system at a conceptual level from systematic perturbation-response data. In this study, we explored a framework that unifies knowledge mining and data mining approaches towards the goal. The framework consists of the following automated processes: 1) applying an ontology-driven knowledge mining approach to identify functional modules among the genes responding to a perturbation in order to reveal potential signals affected by the perturbation; 2) applying a graph-based data mining approach to search for perturbations that affect a common signal with respect to a functional module, and 3) revealing the architecture of a signaling system organize signaling units into a hierarchy based on their relationships. Applying this framework to a compendium of yeast perturbation-response data, we have successfully recovered many well-known signal transduction pathways; in addition, our analysis have led to many hypotheses regarding the yeast signal transduction system; finally, our analysis automatically organized perturbed genes as a graph reflecting the architect of the yeast signaling system. Importantly, this framework transformed molecular findings from a gene level to a conceptual level, which readily can be translated into computable knowledge in the form of rules regarding the yeast signaling system, such as ""if genes involved in MAPK signaling are perturbed, genes involved in pheromone responses will be differentially expressed"".",2013-02-21T17:14:59Z,2013-02-22T15:09:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5344v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.5344v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.GN"
Rand-OFDM: A Secured Wireless Signal,"Hesham Mohammed, Dola Saha","Wireless communication has been a broadcast system since its inception, which violates security and privacy issues at the physical layer between the intended transmit and receive pairs. As we move towards advanced spectrum sharing methodologies involving billions of devices connected over wireless networks, it is essential to secure the wireless signal such that only the intended receiver can realize the properties of the signal. In this paper, we propose Rand-OFDM, a new waveform, secured with a shared secret key, where the signal properties can be recovered only at the expected receiver. We achieve the signal level security by modifying the OFDM signal in time-domain, thus erasing the OFDM properties and in turn obfuscating the signal properties to an eavesdropper. We introduce a key-based secured training signal for channel estimation, which can be used only at the intended receiver with prior knowledge of the key. As a final step for the recovery of the signal, we use a clustering-based technique to correct the phase of the received signal. Our cryptanalysis shows that Rand-OFDM is especially useful in future wideband signals. Extensive simulation and over-the-air experiments show that the performance of Rand-OFDM is comparable to legacy OFDM and SNR penalty due to the secured waveform varies between 1-4dB. In all these scenarios, Rand-OFDM remains unrecognized by the adversary even at the highest possible SNR.",2019-12-11T20:45:37Z,2019-12-11T20:45:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05615v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05615v1,eess.SP
Ranking power spectra: a proof of concept,"Zhenning Mei, Xilin Yu, Chen Chen, Wei Chen","Objective: To characterize the irregularity of the spectrum of a signal, spectral entropy is a widely adopted measure. However, such a metric is invariant under any permutation of the estimations of the powers of individual frequency components on a predefined grid. This erases the order structure inherent in the spectrum which is also an important aspect of irregularity of the signal. To disentangle the order structure and extract meaningful information from raw digital signal, novel analysis method is necessary. Approach: A novel method to depict the order structure by simply ranking power estimations on frequency grid of a evenly spaced signal is proposed. Two descriptors mapping real- and vector-valued power spectrum estimation of a signal into scalar value are defined in a heuristic manner. By definition, the proposed descriptor is capable of distinguishing signals with identical spectrum entropies. Main Results: The proposed descriptor showed its potential in diverse problems. Significant (p<0.001) differences were observed from brain signals and surface electromyography of different pathological/physiological states. Drastic change accompanied by the alteration of the underlying process of signals enables it as candidate feature for seizure detection and endpoint detection in speech signal. Significance: This letter explores the previously ignored order structure in the spectrum of physiological signal. We take one step forward along this direction by proposing two computationally efficient descriptors with guaranteed information gain. As far as the authors are concerned, this is the first work revealing the effectiveness of the order structure in the spectrum in physiological signal processing.",2019-05-27T07:01:50Z,2019-05-27T07:01:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11003v1,eess.SP

To remove noise from the speech signal transmission or to extract useful parts of the signal such as the components lying within a certain frequency range, filters are necessary. Filters are broadly used in signal processing and communication systems in applications such as channel equalization, noise reduction, radar, audio processing, speech signal processing, video processing, biomedical signal processing that is noisy ECG, EEG, EMG signal filtering, electrical circuit analysis and analysis of economic and financial data. In this paper, three types of infinite impulse response filter i.e. Butterworth, Chebyshev type I and Elliptical filter have been discussed theoretically and experimentally. Butterworth, Chebyshev type I and elliptic low pass, high pass, band pass and band stop filter have been designed in this paper using MATLAB Software.

A novel ECG signal denoising filter selection algorithm based on   conventional neural networks,"Chandresh Pravin, Varun Ojha","We propose a novel deep learning based denoising filter selection algorithm for noisy Electrocardiograph (ECG) signal preprocessing. ECG signals measured under clinical conditions, such as those acquired using skin contact devices in hospitals, often contain baseline signal disturbances and unwanted artefacts; indeed for signals obtained outside of a clinical environment, such as heart rate signatures recorded using non-contact radar systems, the measurements contain greater levels of noise than those acquired under clinical conditions. In this paper, we focus on heart rate signals acquired using non-contact radar systems for use in assisted living environments. Such signals contain more noise than those measured under clinical conditions and thus require a novel signal noise removal method capable of adaptive determining filters. Currently, the most common method of removing noise from such a waveform is through the use of filters; the most popular filtering method amongst which is the wavelet filter. There are, however, circumstances in which using a different filtering method may result in higher signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR) for a waveform; in this paper, we investigate the wavelet and elliptical filtering methods for the task of reducing noise in ECG signals acquired using assistive technologies.

Photonics-assisted analog wideband self-interference cancellation for   in-band full-duplex MIMO systems with adaptive digital amplitude and delay   pre-matching,"Taixia Shi, Yang Chen","A photonics-assisted analog wideband RF self-interference (SI) cancellation and frequency downconversion approach for in-band full-duplex (IBFD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with adaptive digital amplitude and delay pre-matching is proposed based on a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (DP-MZM). In each MIMO receiving antenna, the received signal, including different SI signals from different transmitting antennas and the signal of interest, is applied to one arm of the upper dual-drive Mach-ehnder modulator (DD-MZM) of the DP-MZM, the reference signal is applied to the other arm of the upper DD-MZM, and the local oscillator signal is applied to the lower DD-MZM. The SI signals are canceled in the optical domain in the upper DD-MZM and the frequency downconversion is achieved after photodetection. To cancel the SI signals, the reference signal is constructed in the digital domain, while the amplitude and delay of the constructed reference are adjusted digitally by upsampling with high accuracy. Experiments are performed when two different SI signals are employed. The genetic algorithm and least-squares algorithm are combined with segmented searching respectively for the SI signal reconstruction and amplitude and delay pre-matching.

Signal duration and the time scale dependence of signal integration in   biochemical pathways,Jason W. Locasale,"Signal duration (e.g. the time scales over which an active signaling intermediate persists) is a key regulator of biological decisions in myriad contexts such as cell growth, proliferation, and developmental lineage commitments. Accompanying differences in signal duration are numerous downstream biological processes that require multiple steps of biochemical regulation. Here, we present an analysis that investigates how simple biochemical motifs that involve multiple stages of regulation can be constructed to differentially process signals that persist at different time scales. We compute the dynamic gain within these networks and resulting power spectra to better understand how biochemical networks can integrate signals at different time scales. We identify topological features of these networks that allow for different frequency dependent signal processing properties. Our studies suggest design principles for why signal duration in connection with multiple steps of downstream regulation is a ubiquitous control motif in biochemical systems.",2008-02-19T17:01:22Z,2008-02-19T17:01:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2683v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.2683v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.SC"
Self-organization of signal transduction,Gabriele Scheler,"We propose a model of parameter learning for signal transduction, where the objective function is defined by signal transmission efficiency. We apply this to learn kinetic rates as a form of evolutionary learning, and look for parameters which satisfy the objective. This is a novel approach compared to the usual technique of adjusting parameters only on the basis of experimental data. The resulting model is self-organizing, i.e. perturbations in protein concentrations or changes in extracellular signaling will automatically lead to adaptation. We systematically perturb protein concentrations and observe the response of the system. We find compensatory or co-regulation of protein expression levels. In a novel experiment, we alter the distribution of extracellular signaling, and observe adaptation based on optimizing signal transmission. We also discuss the relationship between signaling with and without transients. Signaling by transients may involve maximization of signal transmission efficiency for the peak response, but a minimization in steady-state responses. With an appropriate objective function, this can also be achieved by concentration adjustment. Self-organizing systems may be predictive of unwanted drug interference effects, since they aim to mimic complex cellular adaptation in a unified way.",2012-10-23T00:07:56Z,2013-01-08T06:07:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6089v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6089v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.PE"

Dendritic cells (DC) integrate these cues to make informed decisions whether to initiate an immune response. Confronted with exogenous microbial stimuli, DC endogenously produce both anti- (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (TNF$\alpha$) cues whose joint integration controls the cell's final decision. We combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to quantitatively describe the integration mode of these opposing signals. We propose a two step integration model that modulates the effect of the two types of signals: an initial bottleneck integrates both signals (IL-10 and TNF$\alpha$), the output of which is later modulated by the anti-inflammatory signal. We show that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 signaling is long ranged, as opposed to the short-ranged pro-inflammatory TNF$\alpha$ signaling. The model suggests that the population averaging and modulation of the pro-inflammatory response by the anti-inflammatory signal is a safety guard against excessive immune responses.",2016-07-25T12:41:11Z,2016-07-25T12:41:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07244v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.07244v1,q-bio.MN

Optimal Prediction by Cellular Signaling Networks,"Nils B. Becker, Andrew Mugler, Pieter Rein ten Wolde","Living cells can enhance their fitness by anticipating environmental change. We study how accurately linear signaling networks in cells can predict future signals. We find that maximal predictive power results from a combination of input-noise suppression, linear extrapolation, and selective readout of correlated past signal values. Single-layer networks generate exponential response kernels, which suffice to predict Markovian signals optimally. Multilayer networks allow oscillatory kernels that can optimally predict non-Markovian signals. At low noise, these kernels exploit the signal derivative for extrapolation, while at high noise, they capitalize on signal values in the past that are strongly correlated with the future signal. We show how the common motifs of negative feedback and incoherent feed-forward can implement these optimal response functions. Simulations reveal that E. coli can reliably predict concentration changes for chemotaxis, and that the integration time of its response kernel arises from a trade-off between rapid response and noise suppression.",2015-12-07T17:10:49Z,2015-12-07T17:10:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02124v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02124v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.CB"

Optimality of intercellular signaling: direct transport versus diffusion,"Hyunjoong Kim, Yoichiro Mori, Joshua B. Plotkin","Intercellular signaling has an important role in organism development, but not all communication occurs using the same mechanism. Here, we analyze the energy efficiency of intercellular signaling by two canonical mechanisms: diffusion of signaling molecules and direct transport mediated by signaling cellular protrusions. We show that efficient contact formation for direct transport can be established by an optimal rate of projecting protrusions, which depends on the availability of information about the location of the target cell. The optimal projection rate also depends on how signaling molecules are transported along the protrusion, in particular the ratio of the energy cost for contact formation and molecule synthesis. Also, we compare the efficiency of the two signaling mechanisms, under various model parameters. We find that the direct transport is favored over the diffusion when transporting a large amount of signaling molecules. There is a critical number of signaling molecules at which the efficiency of the two mechanisms are the same. The critical number is small when the distance between cells is far, which helps explain why protrusion-based mechanisms are observed in long-range cellular communications.",2022-04-20T20:14:28Z,2022-10-24T17:53:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09768v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09768v2,q-bio.QM

The Companion Model -- a Canonical Model in Graph Signal Processing,"John Shi, Jose M. F. Moura","This paper introduces a $\textit{canonical}$ graph signal model defined by a $\textit{canonical}$ graph and a $\textit{canonical}$ shift, the $\textit{companion}$ graph and the $\textit{companion}$ shift. These are canonical because, under standard conditions, we show that any graph signal processing (GSP) model can be transformed into the canonical model. The transform that obtains this is the graph $z$-transform ($\textrm{G$z$T}$) that we introduce. The GSP canonical model comes closest to the discrete signal processing (DSP) time signal models: the structure of the companion shift decomposes into a line shift and a signal continuation just like the DSP shift and the GSP canonical graph is a directed line graph with a terminal condition reflecting the signal continuation condition. We further show that, surprisingly, in the canonical model, convolution of graph signals is fast convolution by the DSP FFT.",2022-03-25T17:20:52Z,2022-03-25T17:20:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13791v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13791v1,eess.SP
A Neural Network-Prepended GLRT Framework for Signal Detection Under   Nonlinear Distortions,"Rajeev Sahay, Swaroop Appadwedula, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton","Many communications and sensing applications hinge on the detection of a signal in a noisy, interference-heavy environment. Signal processing theory yields techniques such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to perform detection when the received samples correspond to a linear observation model. Numerous practical applications exist, however, where the received signal has passed through a nonlinearity, causing significant performance degradation of the GLRT. In this work, we propose prepending the GLRT detector with a neural network classifier capable of identifying the particular nonlinear time samples in a received signal. We show that pre-processing received nonlinear signals using our trained classifier to eliminate excessively nonlinear samples (i) improves the detection performance of the GLRT on nonlinear signals and (ii) retains the theoretical guarantees provided by the GLRT on linear observation models for accurate signal detection.",2022-06-15T01:34:47Z,2022-06-15T01:34:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07232v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07232v1,eess.SP

Detecting Low Pass Graph Signals via Spectral Pattern: Sampling   Complexity and Applications,"Chenyue Zhang, Yiran He, Hoi-To Wai","This paper proposes a blind detection problem for low pass graph signals. Without assuming knowledge of the exact graph topology, we aim to detect if a set of graph signal observations are generated from a low pass graph filter. Our problem is motivated by the widely adopted assumption of low pass (a.k.a.~smooth) signals required by many existing works in graph signal processing (GSP), as well as the longstanding problem of network dynamics identification. Focusing on detecting low pass graph signals on modular graphs whose cutoff frequency coincides with the number of clusters in the graph, we propose to leverage the unique spectral pattern exhibited by such low pass graph signals. We analyze the sample complexity of these detectors considering the effects of graph filter's properties, random delays, and other parameters. We show novel applications of the blind detector on robustifying graph learning, identifying antagonistic ties in opinion dynamics, and detecting anomalies in power systems. Numerical experiments validate our findings.",2023-06-02T14:05:58Z,2024-06-21T06:40:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01553v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01553v3,eess.SP
Sampling and Recovery of Signals on a Simplicial Complex using   Neighbourhood Aggregation,"Siddartha Reddy, Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri","In this work, we focus on sampling and recovery of signals over simplicial complexes. In particular, we subsample a simplicial signal of a certain order and focus on recovering multi-order bandlimited simplicial signals of one order higher and one order lower. To do so, we assume that the simplicial signal admits the Helmholtz decomposition that relates simplicial signals of these different orders. Next, we propose an aggregation sampling scheme for simplicial signals based on the Hodge Laplacian matrix and a simple least squares estimator for recovery. We also provide theoretical conditions on the number of aggregations and size of the sampling set required for faithful reconstruction as a function of the bandwidth of simplicial signals to be recovered.

The model codifies the time-varying wave-shape information in the relative amplitude and phase of the harmonic components of the wave-shape. The algorithm was validated on both real and synthetic signals for the tasks of denoising, decomposition and adaptive segmentation. For the denoising task, both monocomponent and multicomponent synthetic signals were considered. In both cases, the proposed algorithm can accurately recover the time-varying wave-shape of non-stationary signals, even in the presence of high levels of noise, outperforming existing wave-shape estimation algorithms and denoising methods based on short-time Fourier transform thresholding. The denoising of an electroencephalograph signal was also performed, giving similar results. For decomposition, our proposal was able to recover the composing waveforms more accurately by considering the time variations from the harmonic amplitude functions when compared to existing methods. Finally, the algorithm was used for the adaptive segmentation of synthetic signals and an electrocardiograph of a patient undergoing ventricular fibrillation.",2023-09-26T19:15:51Z,2023-09-26T19:15:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15211v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15211v1,eess.SP
Modeling Sparse Graph Sequences and Signals Using Generalized Graphons,"Feng Ji, Xingchao Jian, Wee Peng Tay","Graphons are limit objects of sequences of graphs and are used to analyze the behavior of large graphs. Recently, graphon signal processing has been developed to study signal processing on large graphs. A major limitation of this approach is that any sparse sequence of graphs inevitably converges to the zero graphon, rendering the resulting signal processing theory trivial and inadequate for sparse graph sequences. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new signal processing framework that leverages the concept of generalized graphons and introduces the stretched cut distance as a measure to compare these graphons. Our framework focuses on the sampling of graph sequences from generalized graphons and explores the convergence properties of associated operators, spectra, and signals. Our signal processing framework provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing and processing signals on graph sequences, even if they are sparse. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our theory for real-world large networks through numerical experiments.",2023-12-13T13:24:22Z,2024-03-23T07:40:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08124v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08124v3,eess.SP
The beltway problem over orthogonal groups,"Tamir Bendory, Dan Edidin, Oscar Mickelin","The classical beltway problem entails recovering a set of points from their unordered pairwise distances on the circle. This problem can be viewed as a special case of the crystallographic phase retrieval problem of recovering a sparse signal from its periodic autocorrelation. Based on this interpretation, and motivated by cryo-electron microscopy, we suggest a natural generalization to orthogonal groups: recovering a sparse signal, up to an orthogonal transformation, from its autocorrelation over the orthogonal group. If the support of the signal is collision-free, we bound the number of solutions to the beltway problem over orthogonal groups, and prove that this bound is exactly one when the support of the signal is radially collision-free (i.e., the support points have distinct magnitudes). We also prove that if the pairwise products of the signal's weights are distinct, then the autocorrelation determines the signal uniquely, up to an orthogonal transformation. We conclude the paper by considering binary signals and show that in this case, the collision-free condition need not be sufficient to determine signals up to orthogonal transformation.",2024-02-06T08:01:31Z,2024-07-28T05:58:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03787v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03787v2,eess.SP
Dequantization of a signal from two parallel quantized observations,"Vojtƒõch Kovanda, Pavel Rajmic",We propose a technique of signal acquisition using a combination of two devices with different sampling rates and quantization accuracies.

Time-Varying Graph Signal Estimation among Multiple Sub-Networks,"Tsutahiro Fukuhara, Junya Hara, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka","This paper presents an estimation method for time-varying graph signals among multiple sub-networks. In many sensor networks, signals observed are associated with nodes (i.e., sensors), and edges of the network represent the inter-node connectivity. For a large sensor network, measuring signal values at all nodes over time requires huge resources, particularly in terms of energy consumption. To alleviate the issue, we consider a scenario that a sub-network, i.e., cluster, from the whole network is extracted and an intra-cluster analysis is performed based on the statistics in the cluster. The statistics are then utilized to estimate signal values in another cluster. This leads to the requirement for transferring a set of parameters of the sub-network to the others, while the numbers of nodes in the clusters are typically different. In this paper, we propose a cooperative Kalman filter between two sub-networks. The proposed method alternately estimates signals in time between two sub-networks. We formulate a state-space model in the source cluster and transfer it to the target cluster on the basis of optimal transport. In the signal estimation experiments of synthetic and real-world signals, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2024-09-17T06:17:21Z,2024-09-17T06:17:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10915v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10915v1,eess.SP
Time-varying Graph Signal Estimation via Dynamic Multi-hop Topologies,"Yi Yan, Fengfan Zhao, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu","The assumption of using a static graph to represent multivariate time-varying signals oversimplifies the complexity of modeling their interactions over time. We propose a Dynamic Multi-hop model that captures dynamic interactions among time-varying node signals, while also accounting for time-varying edge signals, by extracting latent edges through topological diffusion and edge pruning. The resulting graphs are time-varying and sparse, capturing key dynamic node interactions and representing signal diffusion to both near and distant neighbors over time. The Dynamic Multi-hop Estimation algorithm is further proposed, accurately representing the interaction dynamics among node signals while enabling adaptive estimation of time-varying multivariate signals spatially and temporally.

"Cellular forgetting, desensitisation, stress and aging in signalling   networks. When do cells refuse to learn more?","Tamas Veres, Mark Kerestely, Borbala M. Kovacs, David Keresztes, Klara Schulc, Erik Seitz, Zsolt Vassy, Daniel V. Veres, Peter Csermely","Recent findings show that single, non-neuronal cells are also able to learn signalling responses developing cellular memory. In cellular learning nodes of signalling networks strengthen their interactions e.g. by the conformational memory of intrinsically disordered proteins, protein translocation, miRNAs, lncRNAs, chromatin memory and signalling cascades. This can be described by a generalized, unicellular Hebbian learning process, where those signalling connections, which participate in learning, become stronger. Here we review those scenarios, where cellular signalling is not only repeated in a few times (when learning occurs), but becomes too frequent, too large, or too complex and overloads the cell. This leads to desensitisation of signalling networks by decoupling signalling components, receptor internalization, and consequent downregulation. These molecular processes are examples of anti-Hebbian learning and forgetting of signalling networks. Stress can be perceived as signalling overload inducing the desensitisation of signalling pathways. Aging occurs by the summative effects of cumulative stress downregulating signalling. We propose that cellular learning desensitisation, stress and aging may be placed along the same axis of more and more intensive (prolonged or repeated) signalling. We discuss how cells might discriminate between repeated and unexpected signals, and highlight the Hebbian and anti-Hebbian mechanisms behind the fold-change detection in the NF-\k{appa}B signalling pathway. We list drug design methods using Hebbian learning (such as chemically-induced proximity) and clinical treatment modalities inducing (cancer, drug allergies) desensitisation or avoiding drug-induced desensitisation. A better discrimination between cellular learning, desensitisation and stress may open novel directions in drug design, e.g., helping to overcome drug-resistance.",2023-12-28T08:04:05Z,2024-02-20T07:27:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16875v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16875v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.CB"
Detection and Classification of UAVs Using RF Fingerprints in the   Presence of Interference,"Martins Ezuma, Fatih Erden, Chethan Kumar Anjinappa, Ozgur Ozdemir, Ismail Guvenc","This paper investigates the problem of detection and classification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of wireless interference signals using a passive radio frequency (RF) surveillance system. The system uses a multistage detector to distinguish signals transmitted by a UAV controller from the background noise and interference signals. First, RF signals from any source are detected using a Markov models-based na\""ive Bayes decision mechanism. When the receiver operates at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, and the threshold, which defines the states of the models, is set at a level 3.5 times the standard deviation of the preprocessed noise data, a detection accuracy of 99.8% with a false alarm rate of 2.8% is achieved. Second, signals from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emitters, if present, are detected based on the bandwidth and modulation features of the detected RF signal. Once the input signal is identified as a UAV controller signal, it is classified using machine learning (ML) techniques. Fifteen statistical features extracted from the energy transients of the UAV controller signals are fed to neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and the three most significant features are selected. The performance of the NCA and five different ML classifiers are studied for 15 different types of UAV controllers. A classification accuracy of 98.13% is achieved by k-nearest neighbor classifier at 25 dB SNR. Classification performance is also investigated at different SNR levels and for a set of 17 UAV controllers which includes two pairs from the same UAV controller models.",2019-09-12T01:40:00Z,2019-09-12T01:40:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05429v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05429v1,eess.SP

One of the main differences between the MS-NOMA and the traditional positioning signal is MS-NOMA supports configurable powers for different positioning users (P-Users) to obtain better ranging accuracy and signal coverage. Our major contributions are: Firstly, we present the MS-NOMA signal and analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) and ranging accuracy by deriving their simple expressions. The results show the interaction between the communication and positioning signals is rather limited, and it is feasible to use the MS-NOMA signal to achieve high positioning accuracy. Secondly, for an optimal positioning accuracy and signal coverage, we model the power allocation problem for MS-NOMA signal as a convex optimization problem by satisfying the QoS (Quality of Services) requirement and other constraints. Then, we propose a novel Positioning-Communication Joint Power Allocation (PCJPA) algorithm which allocates the powers of all P-Users iteratively. The theoretical and numerical results show our proposed MS-NOMA signal has great improvements of ranging/positioning accuracy than traditional PRS (Positioning Reference Signal) in 5G, and improves the coverage dramatically which means more P-Users could locate their positions without suffering the near-far effect.",2019-10-10T03:26:57Z,2019-10-10T03:26:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04350v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04350v1,eess.SP
A New TOA Localization and Synchronization System with Virtually   Synchronized Periodic Asymmetric Ranging Network,"Sihao Zhao, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Xiaowei Cui, Mingquan Lu","In this article, we design a new time-of-arrival (TOA) system for simultaneous user device (UD) localization and synchronization with a periodic asymmetric ranging network, namely PARN. The PARN includes one primary anchor node (PAN) transmitting and receiving signals, and many secondary ANs (SAN) only receiving signals. All the UDs can transmit and receive signals. The PAN periodically transmits sync signal and the UD transmits response signal after reception of the sync signal. Using TOA measurements from the periodic sync signal at SANs, we develop a Kalman filtering method to virtually synchronize ANs with high accuracy estimation of clock parameters. Employing the virtual synchronization, and TOA measurements from the response signal and sync signal, we then develop a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, namely ML-LAS, to simultaneously localize and synchronize a moving UD. We analyze the UD localization and synchronization error, and derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Different from existing asymmetric ranging network-based TOA systems, the new PARN i) uses the periodic sync signals at the SAN to exploit the temporal correlated clock information for high accuracy virtual synchronization, and ii) compensates the UD movement and clock drift using various TOA measurements to achieve consistent and simultaneous localization and synchronization performance. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis that the new system has high accuracy in AN clock offset estimation and simultaneous localization and synchronization for a moving UD. We implement a prototype hardware system and demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the PARN in real-world applications by experiments.",2021-03-17T02:06:28Z,2021-03-17T02:06:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09399v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09399v1,eess.SP
Open Set Wireless Standard Classification Using Convolutional Neural   Networks,"Samuel R. Shebert, Anthony F. Martone, R. Michael Buehrer","In congested electromagnetic environments, cognitive radios require knowledge about other emitters in order to optimize their dynamic spectrum access strategy. Deep learning classification algorithms have been used to recognize the wireless signal standards of emitters with high accuracy, but are limited to classifying signal classes that appear in their training set. This diminishes the performance of deep learning classifiers deployed in the field because they cannot accurately identify signals from classes outside of the training set. In this paper, a convolution neural network based open set classifier is proposed with the ability to detect if signals are not from known classes by thresholding the output sigmoid activation. The open set classifier was trained on 4G LTE, 5G NR, IEEE 802.11ax, Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0, and Narrowband Internet-of-Things signals impaired with Rayleigh or Rician fading, AWGN, frequency offsets, and in-phase/quadrature imbalances. Then, the classifier was tested on OFDM, SC-FDMA, SC, AM, and FM signals, which did not appear in the training set classes. The closed set classifier achieves an average accuracy of 94.5% for known signals with SNR's greater than 0 dB, but by design, has a 0% accuracy detecting signals from unknown classes. On the other hand, the open set classifier retains an 86% accuracy for known signal classes, but can detect 95.5% of signals from unknown classes with SNR's greater than 0 dB.",2021-08-03T17:54:40Z,2021-08-03T17:54:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01656v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01656v1,eess.SP
A Machine Learning Approach to Automatic Classification of Eight Sleep   Disorders,"Dylan Zhuang, Ivey Rao, Ali K Ibrahim","In this research, we attempt to answer the following basic research questions: Is a machine learning model able to classify all types of sleep disorders with high accuracy? Among the different modalities of sleep disorder signals, are some more important than others? Do raw signals improve the performance of a deep learning model when they are used as inputs? Prior research showed that most sleep disorders belong to eight categories. To study the performance of machine learning models in classifying polysomnography recordings into the eight categories of sleep pathologies, we selected the Cyclic Alternating Pattern Sleep Database. We developed a multi-channel Deep Learning model where a set of Convolutional Neural Networks were applied to six channels of raw signals of different modalities, including three channels of EEG signals and one channel each of EMG, ECG , and EOG signals. To compare the performance of the DL model with other models, we designed a model that took spectral features, instead of raw signals, as its inputs. We first studied the ""importance"" issue of signal modalities using the RF algorithm. We found that ECG contributed most to the important features and EMG second, among the four signal modalities. We then studied the accuracy performance of the proposed machine learning models. We verified that the multi-channel DL-R model, which took raw signals as its inputs, outperformed all other models, with its sensitivity and specificity scores both being above 95 %. This accuracy performance is on a par with those published results which dealt with fewer types of sleep disorders. We adopted two popular heatmap-generating techniques, with which we confirmed that the DL model's superior performance was owing to the CNN network's ability to extract potent features from raw signals.",2022-04-14T14:40:53Z,2022-04-14T14:40:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06997v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06997v1,eess.SP

We considered EEG signals are impinging on tensor-based approach, named nonlinear Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). In this study, we collected EEG signals during a resting-state task. Then, we defined that the source signals are original EEG signals and the generated tensor is perturbed by Gaussian noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0 dB.

Predictive Modeling of Biomedical Signals Using Controlled Spatial   Transformation,"Jiaming Chen, Ali Valehi, Abolfazl Razi","An important paradigm in smart health is developing diagnosis tools and monitoring a patient's heart activity through processing Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a key example, sue to high mortality rate of heart-related disease. However, current heart monitoring devices suffer from two important drawbacks: i) failure in capturing inter-patient variability, and ii) incapability of identifying heart abnormalities ahead of time to take effective preventive and therapeutic interventions.   This paper proposed a novel predictive signal processing method to solve these issues. We propose a two-step classification framework for ECG signals, where a global classifier recognizes severe abnormalities by comparing the signal against a universal reference model. The seemingly normal signals are then passed through a personalized classifier, to recognize mild but informative signal morphology distortions. The key idea is to develop a novel deviation analysis based on a controlled nonlinear transformation to capture significant deviations of the signal towards any of predefined abnormality classes. Here, we embrace the proven but overlooked fact that certain features of ECG signals reflect underlying cardiac abnormalities before the occurrences of cardiac disease. The proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 96.6% and provides a unique feature of predictive analysis by providing warnings before critical heart conditions. In particular, the chance of observing a severe problem (a red alarm) is raised by about 5% to 10% after observing a yellow alarm of the same type. Although we used this methodology to provide early precaution messages to elderly and high-risk heart-patients, the proposed method is general and applicable to similar bio-medical signal processing applications.",2018-10-31T19:30:45Z,2018-10-31T19:30:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00079v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00079v1,eess.SP
EEG Signal Classification using Variational Mode Decomposition,"Akshith Ullal, Ram Bilas Pachori","Epilepsy affects about 1% of the population every year, and is characterized by abnormal and sudden hyper-synchronous excitation of the neurons in the brain. The electroencephalogram(EEG) is the most widely used method to record brain signals and diagnose epilepsy and seizure cases. In this paper we use the method of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) in our analysis to classify seizure/seizure free signals. This technique uses variational non recursive mode decomposition, in comparison to other methods like Empirical Mode (EMD) and Hilbert-Huang transform which recursively decompose the signals, making them more susceptible to noise and sampling rate. VMD decomposes a signal into its components which are called principal modes. In our analysis, 4 features of the decomposed signals namely Renyi Entropy, second order difference plot (SODP), fourth order difference plot(FODP) and average amplitude are investigated, both individually and using a ranking methodology considering all 4 features at the same time. The SODP of decomposed signal modes is an elliptical structure. The 95% confidence ellipse area measured from the SODP of the decomposed signal modes has been used as a feature in order to discriminate seizure-free EEG signals from the epileptic seizure EEG signal. For the classification, a Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) with back propagation algorithm as the training method was used. A high percentage of accuracy was obtained when the features were used individually for classification and an even higher degree of accuracy was obtained when the ranking methodology was used.",2020-03-28T03:16:14Z,2020-03-28T03:16:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12690v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12690v1,eess.SP
Blind Demixing of Diffused Graph Signals,"Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia, Santiago Segarra, Antonio G. Marques","Using graphs to model irregular information domains is an effective approach to deal with some of the intricacies of contemporary (network) data. A key aspect is how the data, represented as graph signals, depend on the topology of the graph. Widely-used approaches assume that the observed signals can be viewed as outputs of graph filters (i.e., polynomials of a matrix representation of the graph) whose inputs have a particular structure. Diffused graph signals, which correspond to an originally sparse (node-localized) signal percolated through the graph via filtering, fall into this class. In that context, this paper deals with the problem of jointly identifying graph filters and separating their (sparse) input signals from a mixture of diffused graph signals, thus generalizing to the graph signal processing framework the classical blind demixing (blind source separation) of temporal and spatial signals. We first consider the scenario where the supporting graphs are different across the signals, providing a theorem for demixing feasibility along with probabilistic bounds on successful recovery. Additionally, an analysis of the degenerate problem of demixing with a single graph is also presented.

Compared with the medium orbit satellite, the transit time of the LEO satellite is shorter. Thus, it is of great significance to expand the successful acquisition time range of the LEO signal. Previous studies on LEO signal acquisition are based on simulation data. However, signal acquisition research based on real data is very important. In this work, the signal characteristics of LEO satellite: power space density in free space and the Doppler shift of LEO satellite are individually studied. The unified symbol definitions of several integration algorithms based on the parallel search signal acquisition algorithm are given. To verify these algorithms for LEO signal acquisition, a software-defined receiver (SDR) is developed. The performance of those integration algorithms on expanding the successful acquisition time range is verified by the real data collected from the Luojia-1A satellite.

One part is detected to generate the up-converted downlink RF signal, and the other part is re-modulated by the uplink RF signal and the self-interference, which is then transmitted back to the CO for the signal down-conversion and SIC via the optical domain signal adjustment and balanced detection. The functions of SIC, frequency up-conversion, down-conversion, and fiber transmission with dispersion immunity are all incorporated in the system. An experiment is performed. Cancellation depths of more than 39 dB for the single-tone signal and more than 20 dB for the 20-MBaud 16 quadrature amplitude modulation signal are achieved in the back-to-back case. The performance of the system does not have a significant decline when a section of 4.1-km optical fiber is incorporated.",2021-09-01T09:49:31Z,2021-09-01T09:49:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00283v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00283v1,eess.SP
Task-Based Graph Signal Compression,"Pei Li, Nir Shlezinger, Haiyang Zhang, Baoyun Wang, Yonina C. Eldar","Graph signals arise in various applications, ranging from sensor networks to social media data. The high-dimensional nature of these signals implies that they often need to be compressed in order to be stored and transmitted. The common framework for graph signal compression is based on sampling, resulting in a set of continuous-amplitude samples, which in turn have to be quantized into a finite bit representation. In this work we study the joint design of graph signal sampling along with quantization, for graph signal compression. We focus on bandlimited graph signals, and show that the compression problem can be represented as a task-based quantization setup, in which the task is to recover the spectrum of the signal. Based on this equivalence, we propose a joint design of the sampling and recovery mechanisms for a fixed quantization mapping, and present an iterative algorithm for dividing the available bit budget among the discretized samples. Furthermore, we show how the proposed approach can be realized using graph filters combining elements corresponding the neighbouring nodes of the graph, thus facilitating distributed implementation at reduced complexity. Our numerical evaluations on both synthetic and real world data shows that the joint sampling and quantization method yields a compact finite bit representation of high-dimensional graph signals, which allows reconstruction of the original signal with accuracy within a small gap of that achievable with infinite resolution quantizers.",2021-10-24T08:28:48Z,2021-10-24T08:28:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12387v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12387v1,eess.SP
Iterative Signal Processing for Integrated Sensing and Communication   Systems,"Zhiqing Wei, Hanyang Qu, Wangjun Jiang, Kaifeng Han, Huici Wu, Zhiyong Feng","Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), with sensing and communication sharing the same wireless resources and hardware, has the advantages of high spectrum efficiency and low hardware cost, which is regarded as one of the key technologies of the fifth generation advanced (5G-A) and sixth generation (6G) mobile communication systems. ISAC has the potential to be applied in the intelligent applications requiring both communication and high accurate sensing capabilities. The fundamental challenges of ISAC system are the ISAC signal design and ISAC signal processing. However, the existing ISAC signal has low anti-noise capability. And the existing ISAC signal processing algorithms have the disadvantages of quantization errors and high complexity, resulting in large energy consumption. In this paper, phase coding is applied in ISAC signal design to improve the anti-noise performance of ISAC signal. Then, the effect of phase coding method on improving the sensing accuracy is analyzed. In order to improve the sensing accuracy with low-complexity algorithm, the iterative ISAC signal processing methods are proposed. The proposed methods improve the sensing accuracy with low computational complexity, realizing energy efficient ISAC signal processing. Taking the scenarios of short distance and long distance sensing into account, the iterative two-dimensional (2D) fast Fourier transform (FFT) and iterative cyclic cross-correlation (CC) methods are proposed, respectively, realizing high sensing accuracy and low computational complexity. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed ISAC signal processing methods are verified by simulation results.",2023-06-08T14:33:04Z,2023-06-08T14:33:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05235v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05235v1,eess.SP
Understanding Concepts in Graph Signal Processing for Neurophysiological   Signal Analysis,"Stephan Goerttler, Fei He, Min Wu","Multivariate signals, which are measured simultaneously over time and acquired by sensor networks, are becoming increasingly common. The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse spectral characteristics of these multivariate signals, while at the same time taking the spatial structure between the time signals into account. A central idea in GSP is the graph Fourier transform, which projects a multivariate signal onto frequency-ordered graph Fourier modes, and can therefore be regarded as a spatial analog of the temporal Fourier transform. This chapter derives and discusses key concepts in GSP, with a specific focus on how the various concepts relate to one another. The experimental section focuses on the role of graph frequency in data classification, with applications to neuroimaging. To address the limited sample size of neurophysiological datasets, we introduce a minimalist simulation framework that can generate arbitrary amounts of data. Using this artificial data, we find that lower graph frequency signals are less suitable for classifying neurophysiological data as compared to higher graph frequency signals. Finally, we introduce a baseline testing framework for GSP. Employing this framework, our results suggest that GSP applications may attenuate spectral characteristics in the signals, highlighting current limitations of GSP for neuroimaging.",2023-12-06T09:12:29Z,2025-01-09T17:15:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03371v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03371v3,eess.SP
On the Parameter Estimation of Sinusoidal Models for Speech and Audio   Signals,George P. Kafentzis,"In this paper, we examine the parameter estimation performance of three well-known sinusoidal models for speech and audio. The first one is the standard Sinusoidal Model (SM), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The second is the Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Model (EDSM) which has been proposed in the last decade, and utilizes a subspace method for parameter estimation, and finally the extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model (eaQHM), which has been recently proposed for AM-FM decomposition, and estimates the signal parameters using Least Squares on a set of basis function that are adaptive to the local characteristics of the signal. The parameter estimation of each model is briefly described and its performance is compared to the others in terms of signal reconstruction accuracy versus window size on a variety of synthetic signals and versus the number of sinusoids on real signals. The latter include highly non stationary signals, such as singing voices and guitar solos. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are presented via synthetic signals and then the application on real signals is discussed. Conclusively, eaQHM outperforms EDS in medium-to-large window size analysis, whereas EDSM yields higher reconstruction values for smaller analysis window sizes. Thus, a future research direction appears to be the merge of adaptivity of the eaQHM and parameter estimation robustness of the EDSM in a new paradigm for high-quality analysis and resynthesis of general audio signals.",2024-01-02T15:46:19Z,2024-01-02T15:46:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01255v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01255v1,"eess.AS, eess.SP"
CycloDSP: A cyclostationary signal analysis tool for GNU Radio,"Donatella Darsena, Giacinto Gelli, Ivan Iudice","In this paper, we present a first attempt to incorporate in the GNU Radio ecosystem a tool called CycloDSP, devoted to the analysis of complex-valued cyclostationary signals. Such signals are ubiquitous in communication and signal processing, exhibiting periodic or almost periodic statistics that are characterized by a countable set of cycle frequencies, which are related to the main signal periodicities. Common cycle frequencies for modulated signals are multiple of the baudrate and/or combination of the carrier frequency and baudrate. Conventional estimation strategies for cyclostationary signal analysis typically exhibit a high computational burden. Many approaches aimed at reducing complexity exploit fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, which are very efficient for batch data but are not suited for continuously streaming data, typically encountered in software-defined radio (SDR) applications. The aim of this paper is to develop an out-of-tree (OOT) GNU Radio module containing a set of building block functions, aimed at estimating functions, such as the cyclic correlation functions, typically employed for cyclostationary signal analysis. The proposed implementation must be designed so as to ensure high efficiency in processing continuous data streams of complex samples, both in terms of computational load and data storage, in order to be executed on general purpose computers. We tested our implementation by estimating in real-time the second-order cyclic statistics of a Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) modulated signal, which belongs to a class of signals commonly employed in aeronautical telemetry datalinks.",2024-05-27T08:00:00Z,2024-05-27T08:00:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16911v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16911v1,eess.SP
Modulo Sampling in Shift-Invariant Spaces: Recovery and Stability   Enhancement,"Yhonatan Kvich, Yonina C. Eldar","Sampling shift-invariant (SI) signals with a high dynamic range poses a notable challenge in the domain of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). It is essential for the ADC's dynamic range to exceed that of the incoming analog signal to ensure no vital information is lost during the conversion process. Modulo sampling, an approach initially explored with bandlimited (BL) signals, offers a promising solution to overcome the constraints of dynamic range. In this paper, we expand on the recent advancements in modulo sampling to encompass a broader range of SI signals. Our proposed strategy incorporates analog preprocessing, including the use of a mixer and a low-pass filter (LPF), to transform the signal into a bandlimited one. This BL signal can be accurately reconstructed from its modulo samples if sampled at slightly above its Nyquist frequency. The recovery of the original SI signal from this BL representation is then achieved through suitable filtering. We also examine the efficacy of this system across various noise conditions. Careful choice of the mixer plays a pivotal role in enhancing the method's reliability, especially with generators prone to instability. Our approach thus broadens the framework of modulo sampling's utility in efficiently recovering SI signals, pushing its boundaries beyond BL signals while sampling only slightly above the rate needed for a SI signal.",2024-06-16T13:23:34Z,2024-06-16T13:23:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10929v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10929v1,eess.SP
Coincident Frequencies and Relative Phases Among Female-Brain Signals   and Progesterone-Estrogen levels,"Silvia Solis Ortiz, Rafael G. Campos, Julian Felix, Octavio Obregon","Fourier transform has become a basic tool for analyzing biological signals 1,2,3. Mostly a fast Fourier transform is computed for a finite sequence of data sample 4. This is the standard way apparatuses and modern computerized technology provide information, according with their frequency range, of the well known brain signals Delta, Theta, Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1 and Beta 2 furnishing experts with electroencephalographic (EEG) profile of clinical use obtained from these short periods 5,6.   For long periods, an analogous novel procedure is established as follows: Assigning certain numerical value, i.e., the absolute power, to each brain signal at certain sampling times, generates data that can be interpolated and extrapolated through a long period, yielding an absolute power function of time for each signal 7. A further Fourier transform is then performed8,9, to analyze these new functions, finding typical frequencies and their corresponding periods for each one of these signals and, also, relative phases for coincident periods between two or more signals.

Integration of cellular signals in chattering environments,"Pau Ru√©, N√∫ria Domedel-Puig, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Antonio J. Pons","Cells are constantly exposed to fluctuating environmental conditions. External signals are sensed, processed and integrated by cellular signal transduction networks, which translate input signals into specific cellular responses by means of biochemical reactions. These networks have a complex nature, and we are still far from having a complete characterization of the process through which they integrate information, specially given the noisy environment in which that information is embedded. Guided by the many instances of constructive influences of noise that have been reported in the physical sciences in the last decades, here we explore how multiple signals are integrated in an eukaryotic cell in the presence of background noise, or chatter. To that end, we use a Boolean model of a typical human signal transduction network. Despite its complexity, we find that the network is able to display simple patterns of signal integration. Furthermore, our computational analysis shows that these integration patterns depend on the levels of fluctuating background activity carried by other cell inputs. Taken together, our results indicate that signal integration is sensitive to environmental fluctuations, and that this background noise effectively determines the information integration capabilities of the cell.",2011-12-23T15:37:01Z,2011-12-23T15:37:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5604v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5604v1,q-bio.MN
Spatial partitioning improves the reliability of biochemical signaling,"Andrew Mugler, Filipe Tostevin, Pieter Rein ten Wolde","Spatial heterogeneity is a hallmark of living systems, even at the molecular scale in individual cells. A key example is the partitioning of membrane-bound proteins via lipid domain formation or cytoskeleton-induced corralling. Yet the impact of this spatial heterogeneity on biochemical signaling processes is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that partitioning improves the reliability of biochemical signaling. We exactly solve a stochastic model describing a ubiquitous motif in membrane signaling. The solution reveals that partitioning improves signaling reliability via two effects: it moderates the non-linearity of the switching response, and it reduces noise in the response by suppressing correlations between molecules. An optimal partition size arises from a trade-off between minimizing the number of proteins per partition to improve signaling reliability and ensuring sufficient proteins per partition to maintain signal propagation. The predicted optimal partition size agrees quantitatively with experimentally observed systems. These results persist in spatial simulations with explicit diffusion barriers. Our findings suggest that molecular partitioning is not merely a consequence of the complexity of cellular substructures, but also plays an important functional role in cell signaling.",2013-02-26T19:28:23Z,2013-02-26T19:28:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6548v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6548v1,q-bio.MN
Discrete Scaling Based on Operator Theory,"Aykut Ko√ß, Burak Bartan, Haldun M. Ozaktas","Signal scaling is a fundamental operation of practical importance in which a signal is enlarged or shrunk in the coordinate direction(s). Scaling or magnification is not trivial for signals of a discrete variable since the signal values may not fall onto the discrete coordinate points. One approach is to consider the discretely-spaced values as the samples of a signal of a real variable, find that signal by interpolation, scale it, and then re-sample. However, this approach comes with complications of interpretation. We review a previously proposed alternative and more elegant approach, and then propose a new approach based on hyperdifferential operator theory that we find most satisfactory in terms of obtaining a self-consistent, pure, and elegant definition of discrete scaling that is fully consistent with the theory of the discrete Fourier transform.",2018-05-09T13:19:50Z,2018-05-09T13:19:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03500v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03500v1,eess.SP

This is the limitation for methods based on MUSIC, otherwise known as signal subspace identification. This paper attempts to exploit properties of wideband signal sources to compartmentalise signals into their respective Time Differences of Arrival. By performing direct positioning after the compartmentalisation process, we will show that geolocation of a large number of sources can be achieved by our proposed method at accuracies that exceed all existing methods, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.",2018-09-12T00:51:30Z,2018-09-12T00:51:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04207v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04207v1,eess.SP
The detection of non-Gaussian vibrations with improved spatial   resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in distributed sensing,"Qian He, Rong Liu, Chengdan Tan, Lijun Tang, Xiongjun Shang","In fiber-optic distributed sensing, vibration signals are mostly assumed to follow Gaussian distribution for the simplicity of signal processing. However, in real applications, vibration signals often behave as non-Gaussian processes, which have rarely been highly considered. In this paper, a higher-order cumulants algorithm based phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) is proposed to detect and analyze non-Gaussian vibration signals accompanied with noises. When disturbances are applied on the sensing fiber, the distribution probability of Rayleigh backscattering signals will deviate from the ideal Gaussian distribution. The non-Gaussian vibration is then extracted from Gaussian noises based on the probability density distribution. Simulations and experiments are carried out.

Fast Periodicity Estimation and Reconstruction of hidden components from   noisy periodic signal,"Bharadwaj Aryasomayajula, Dibakar Sil, Sarbani Palit","Periodicity estimation from an arbitrary length noisy signal is computationally very costly. A recently developed Ramanujan Fat Dictionary is one of the ways to find the hidden components from an arbitrary length (non integral multiple of period) of the signal. This method suffers from high run time due to the lack of information about the period and effect of noise on the signal. We propose a new method that efficiently estimates the period of the signal and finding the hidden components thus becomes easy from it. Our method works well with significantly low SNR values and runs in O(n) time complexity, n being length of the signal. Comparision of run time analysis between our method for period estimation of a given signal and SVD method at various SNR values has been made and the corresponding hidden components are there by extracted by projecting onto the factor-Ramanujan Subspaces.",2019-01-26T06:00:54Z,2019-01-26T06:00:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09167v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09167v1,eess.SP
Model-Driven Deep Learning Method for Jammer Suppression in Massive   Connectivity Systems,"Milutin Pajovic, Toshiaki Koike-Akino, Philip V.

More specifically, we consider a massive connectivity setup where few, out of a large number of users, equipped with spreading codes, synchronously transmit symbols. The received signal is a noisy mixture of symbols transmitted through users' flat fading channels, impaired by fast frequency hopping jamming signal of relatively large power. In the absence of any conventional technique suitable for the considered setup, we propose a ""model-driven"" deep learning method, based on convolution neural network, to suppress jamming signal from the received signal, and detect active users together with their transmitted symbols. A numerical study of the proposed method confirms its effectiveness in scenarios where classical techniques fail. As such, in a two user scenario with wideband jamming signal of power $20$ dB above the power any active user, the proposed algorithm achieves error rates $10^{-2}$ for a wide range of AWGN variances.",2019-03-14T21:24:43Z,2019-03-14T21:24:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06266v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06266v1,eess.SP

In this work, a DOA estimation method for a mixture of SST and DST signals (referred to as the mixed signal transmission (MST) model) is proposed. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to study the DOA estimation problem for such an MST model.

Graph Signal Processing: Vertex Multiplication,"Aykut Ko√ß, Yigit E. Bayiz","On the Euclidean domains of classical signal processing, linking of signal samples to the underlying coordinate structure is straightforward. While graph adjacency matrices totally define the quantitative associations among the underlying graph vertices, a major problem in graph signal processing is the lack of explicit association of vertices with an underlying quantitative coordinate structure. To make this link, we propose an operation, called the vertex multiplication, which is defined for graphs and can operate on graph signals. Vertex multiplication, which generalizes the coordinate multiplication operation in time series signals, can be interpreted as an operator which assigns a coordinate structure to a graph. By using the graph domain extension of differentiation and graph Fourier transform (GFT), vertex multiplication is defined such that it shows Fourier duality, which states that differentiation and coordinate multiplication operations are duals of each other under Fourier transformation (FT). The proposed definition is shown to reduce to coordinate multiplication for graphs corresponding to time series.

By combining change point detection and statistical hypothesis testing, we demonstrate how to clean a signal to emphasize unique local changes within each basis function. This not only allows us to observe which frequency bands are undergoing a change, but also leads to improved recovery of the underlying information. Using this technique, we demonstrate improved signal cleaning performance for acoustic shockwave signal detection.

Intelligent Spectrum Learning for Wireless Networks with Reconfigurable   Intelligent Surfaces,"Bo Yang, Xuelin Cao, Chongwen Huang, Chau Yuen, Lijun Qian, Marco Di Renzo","Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology for enhancing the reliability of wireless communications, which is capable of reflecting the desired signals through appropriate phase shifts. However, the intended signals that impinge upon an RIS are often mixed with interfering signals, which are usually dynamic and unknown. In particular, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) may be degraded by the signals reflected from the RISs that originate from non-intended users. To tackle this issue, we introduce the concept of intelligent spectrum learning (ISL), which uses an appropriately trained convolutional neural network (CNN) at the RIS controller to help the RISs infer the interfering signals directly from the incident signals. By capitalizing on the ISL, a distributed control algorithm is proposed to maximize the received SINR by dynamically configuring the active/inactive binary status of the RIS elements.

Robust Time-Frequency Reconstruction by Learning Structured Sparsity,"Lei Jiang, Haijian Zhang, Lei Yu","Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) play a vital role in providing descriptive analysis of non-stationary signals involved in realistic scenarios. It is well known that low time-frequency (TF) resolution and the emergency of cross-terms (CTs) are two main issues, which make it difficult to analyze and interpret practical signals using TFDs. In order to address these issues, we propose the U-Net aided iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (U-ISTA) for reconstructing a near-ideal TFD by exploiting structured sparsity in signal TF domain. Specifically, the signal ambiguity function is firstly compressed, followed by unfolding the ISTA as a recurrent neural network. To consider continuously distributed characteristics of signals, a structured sparsity constraint is incorporated into the unfolded ISTA by regarding the U-Net as an adaptive threshold block, in which structure-aware thresholds are learned from enormous training data to exploit the underlying dependencies among neighboring TF coefficients. The proposed U-ISTA model is trained by both non-overlapped and overlapped synthetic signals including closely and far located non-stationary components. Experimental results demonstrate that the robust U-ISTA achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, and gains a high TF resolution with CTs greatly eliminated even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments.",2020-04-30T14:25:17Z,2020-04-30T14:25:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14820v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14820v1,eess.SP

An Investigation into the Mathematical Nature of Electrophysiological   Signals with Applications,"Kaushik Majumdar, Anagh Pathak, Viswadeep Sarangi","In this work we have proposed a rigorous mathematical definition for the one dimensional time domain electrophysiological signals and established its relationship with two of the three Dirichlet's conditions. We have argues that any such signal can be represented as the trajectory of a particle moving in a force field with one degree of freedom. At point on the trajectory, that is, on the signal, the kinetic energy dissipated by the particle embeds semantic information into the trajectory or the signal in terms of giving its shape. We have shown that the rate of kinetic energy dissipation operator or the power operator P is of importance in shape analysis of the signal by considering its sign changes. Operating the P-operator on digital signals we have mathematically proved that its sign change can induce 13 different shapes to a three successive point configuration. In other words, semantic information at each point in a digital signal can be embedded by a syllable of 13 different letters.

Bolt Detection Signal Analysis Method Based on ICEEMD,"Chunhui Guo, Zhan Zhang, Xin Xie, Zhengyu Yang","The construction quality of the bolt is directly related to the safety of the project, and as such, it must be tested. In this paper, the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (ICEEMD) method is introduced to the bolt detection signal analysis. The ICEEMD is used in order to decompose the anchor detection signal according to the approximate entropy of each intrinsic mode function (IMF). The noise of the IMFs is eliminated by the wavelet soft threshold de-noising technique. Based on the approximate entropy, and the wavelet de-noising principle, the ICEEMD-De anchor signal analysis method is proposed. From the analysis of the vibration analog signal, as well as the bolt detection signal, the result shows that the ICEEMD-De method is capable of correctly separating the different IMFs under noisy conditions, and also that the IMF can effectively identify the reflection signal of the end of the bolt.",2017-09-21T21:31:30Z,2018-02-24T18:30:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07518v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07518v3,eess.SP
Structure-Aware Bayesian Compressive Sensing for Frequency-Hopping   Spectrum Estimation with Missing Observations,"Shengheng Liu, Yimin Daniel Zhang, Tao Shan, Ran Tao","In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum estimation of multiple frequency-hopping (FH) signals in the presence of random missing observations. The signals are analyzed within the bilinear time-frequency (TF) representation framework, where a TF kernel is designed by exploiting the inherent FH signal structures. The designed kernel permits effective suppression of cross-terms and artifacts due to missing observations while preserving the FH signal auto-terms. The kernelled results are represented in the instantaneous autocorrelation function domain, which are then processed using a re-designed structure-aware Bayesian compressive sensing algorithm to accurately estimate the FH signal TF spectrum. The proposed method achieves high-resolution FH signal spectrum estimation even when a large portion of data observations is missing. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over existing techniques.",2018-02-03T11:27:40Z,2018-02-03T11:27:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00957v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00957v1,eess.SP
An Adaptive Markov Random Field for Structured Compressive Sensing,"Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul, Lei Zhang, Dong Gong, Zhen Zhang, Chao Chen, Damith C. Ranasinghe, Qinfeng Shi","Exploiting intrinsic structures in sparse signals underpins the recent progress in compressive sensing (CS). The key for exploiting such structures is to achieve two desirable properties: generality (\ie, the ability to fit a wide range of signals with diverse structures) and adaptability (\ie, being adaptive to a specific signal). Most existing approaches, however, often only achieve one of these two properties. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive Markov random field sparsity prior for CS, which not only is able to capture a broad range of sparsity structures, but also can adapt to each sparse signal through refining the parameters of the sparsity prior with respect to the compressed measurements. To maximize the adaptability, we also propose a new sparse signal estimation where the sparse signals, support, noise and signal parameter estimation are unified into a variational optimization problem, which can be effectively solved with an alternative minimization scheme. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recovery accuracy, noise tolerance, and runtime.",2018-02-15T03:10:56Z,2018-12-02T10:01:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05395v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05395v2,"eess.SP, eess.IV"
Adaptive Hierarchical Sensing for the Efficient Sampling of Sparse and   Compressible Signals,"Henry Sch√ºtze, Erhardt Barth, Thomas Martinetz","We present the novel adaptive hierarchical sensing algorithm K-AHS, which samples sparse or compressible signals with a measurement complexity equal to that of Compressed Sensing (CS). In contrast to CS, K-AHS is adaptive as sensing vectors are selected while sampling, depending on previous measurements. Prior to sampling, the user chooses a transform domain in which the signal of interest is sparse. The corresponding transform determines the collection of sensing vectors. K-AHS gradually refines initial coarse measurements to significant signal coefficients in the sparse transform domain based on a sensing tree which provides a natural hierarchy of sensing vectors. K-AHS directly provides significant signal coefficients in the sparse transform domain and does not require a reconstruction stage based on inverse optimization. Therefore, the K-AHS sensing vectors must not satisfy any incoherence or restricted isometry property. A mathematical analysis proves the sampling complexity of K-AHS as well as a general and sufficient condition for sampling the optimal k-term approximation, which is applied to particular signal models. The analytical findings are supported by simulations with synthetic signals and real world images. On standard benchmark images, K-AHS achieves lower reconstruction errors than CS.",2018-07-14T10:09:52Z,2018-07-14T10:09:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05371v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05371v1,eess.SP
Introducing Hypergraph Signal Processing: Theoretical Foundation and   Practical Applications,"Songyang Zhang, Zhi Ding, Shuguang Cui","Signal processing over graphs has recently attracted significant attentions for dealing with structured data. Normal graphs, however, only model pairwise relationships between nodes and are not effective in representing and capturing some high-order relationships of data samples, which are common in many applications such as Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we propose a new framework of hypergraph signal processing (HGSP) based on tensor representation to generalize the traditional graph signal processing (GSP) to tackle high-order interactions. We introduce the core concepts of HGSP and define the hypergraph Fourier space. We then study the spectrum properties of hypergraph Fourier transform and explain its connection to mainstream digital signal processing. We derive the novel hypergraph sampling theory and present the fundamentals of hypergraph filter design based on the tensor framework. We present HGSP-based methods for several signal processing and data analysis applications. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement using our HGSP framework over some traditional signal processing solutions.",2019-07-22T09:49:42Z,2020-06-04T06:48:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09203v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09203v5,eess.SP
PhyCode: A Practical Wireless Communication System Exploiting   Superimposed Signals,"Wen Cui, Chen Liu, Lin Cai, Jianping Pan","Superimposed signals are anticipated to improve wireless spectrum efficiency to support the ever-growing IoT applications. Implementing the superimposed signal demands on ideally aligned signals in both the time and frequency domains. Prior work applied an average carrier-frequency offset compensation to the superimposed signal under the assumptions of homogeneous devices and static environments. However, this will cause a significant signal distortion in practice when heterogeneous IoT devices are involved in a dynamic environment. This paper presents PhyCode, which exploits the nature of varying offsets across devices, and designs a dynamic decoding scheme which can react to the exact offsets from different signal sources simultaneously. We implement PhyCode via a software-defined radio platform and demonstrate that PhyCode achieves a lower raw BER compared with the existing state-of-the-art method.",2019-06-27T20:23:33Z,2019-06-27T20:23:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11654v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11654v1,eess.SP
Maximum Feasible Subsystem Algorithms for Recovery of Compressively   Sensed Speech,"Fereshteh Fakhar Firouzeh, John W.

One way to achieve this goal is to apply the principles of compressive sensing, but this has not been particularly successful for real-world signals that are insufficiently sparse, such as speech. We present three new algorithms based on solutions for the maximum feasible subsystem problem (MAX FS) that improve on the state of the art in recovery of compressed speech signals: more highly compressed signals can be successfully recovered with greater quality. The new recovery algorithms deliver sparser solutions when compared with those obtained using traditional compressive sensing recovery algorithms. When tested by recovering compressively sensed speech signals in the TIMIT speech database, the recovered speech has better perceptual quality than speech recovered using traditional compressive sensing recovery algorithms.",2020-03-05T21:20:05Z,2020-03-05T21:20:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02927v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02927v1,eess.SP
Super-resolution of periodic signals from short sequences of samples,Marek W. Rupniewski,"Reconstruction of undersampled periodic signals of unknown period is an important signal processing operation. It is especially difficult operation when the sequences of samples are short and no information on the inter-sequence time distances is given. For such a case, there exist some algorithms that allow for approximation of the sampled signal. However, these algorithms require either bandlimitedness of the signal, or noiseless samples. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm which does not require the signal to be bandlimited and it can cope with additive noise in the samples. The algorithm is illustrated and validated with real data.",2020-10-22T11:12:32Z,2021-05-17T08:43:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11609v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11609v2,eess.SP
Node-Adaptive Regularization for Graph Signal Reconstruction,"Maosheng Yang, Mario Coutino, Geert Leus, Elvin Isufi","A critical task in graph signal processing is to estimate the true signal from noisy observations over a subset of nodes, also known as the reconstruction problem. In this paper, we propose a node-adaptive regularization for graph signal reconstruction, which surmounts the conventional Tikhonov regularization, giving rise to more degrees of freedom; hence, an improved performance. We formulate the node-adaptive graph signal denoising problem, study its bias-variance trade-off, and identify conditions under which a lower mean squared error and variance can be obtained with respect to Tikhonov regularization. Compared with existing approaches, the node-adaptive regularization enjoys more general priors on the local signal variation, which can be obtained by optimally designing the regularization weights based on Prony's method or semidefinite programming. As these approaches require additional prior knowledge, we also propose a minimax (worst-case) strategy to address instances where this extra information is unavailable. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real data corroborate the proposed regularization strategy for graph signal denoising and interpolation, and show its improved performance compared with competing alternatives.",2020-10-26T08:23:13Z,2021-02-04T10:01:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13413v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13413v2,eess.SP
Internal Calibration Process Using Chirp Pulses with Application of the   Adam Learning Algorithm,"Junho Kweon, Chan-Yong Jung, Kyung-Bin Bae, Seong-Ook Park","We propose a new internal calibration process using chirp pulses. Our method is utilized to mitigate thermal drift, which is unwanted changes and usually occurs in active elements such as a high power amplifier and low noise amplifier. The proposed method has advantages from two distinct aspects: calibration signal and algorithm. In respect to the calibration signal, our method does not contain an additional signal source because chirp pulses, which are normally used for remote sensing, are used as calibration signals. Moreover, our methods solve the ambiguity problem of analyzing a phase shift which occurs when sinusoidal signals are used as calibration signals. In regards to the algorithm, the Adam learning algorithm avoids learning in the wrong direction, unlike the conventional gradient descent.   Using our method, mathematical forms of received signals are acquired successfully. Our method shows better effectivity compared to the conventional gradient descent algorithm.

Channel Modeling and Signal Processing for Array-based Visible Light   Communication System in Misalignment,"Jiaqi Wei, Chen Gong, Nuo Huang, Zhengyuan Xu","This paper proposes an indoor visible light communication (VLC) system with multiple transmitters and receivers. Due to diffusivity of LED light beams, photodiode receive signals from many directions. We use one concave and one convex lens as optical antenna, and obtain the optimal lens structure by optimizing which corresponds to the minimum condition number of channel gain matrix. In this way the light emitted by different LED can be separated well from each other then minimize signal interference. However, interference increases in the case of system deviation, so we explore the system mobility. Then subsequent signal processing is carried out, including signal combining and successive interference cancellation (SIC). We combine the same signal received by different receivers to improve signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). And SIC can effectively restore interference and eliminate its impact. The simulation results show that channel capacity can be increased by more than 5 times and up to 20 times under the condition of receiver and transmitter alignment. In the case of movement, channel capacity can also be increased by about 4 times on average.

Noisy-target Training: A Training Strategy for DNN-based Speech   Enhancement without Clean Speech,"Takuya Fujimura, Yuma Koizumi, Kohei Yatabe, Ryoichi Miyazaki","Deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement ordinarily requires clean speech signals as the training target. However, collecting clean signals is very costly because they must be recorded in a studio. This requirement currently restricts the amount of training data for speech enhancement to less than 1/1000 of that of speech recognition which does not need clean signals. Increasing the amount of training data is important for improving the performance, and hence the requirement of clean signals should be relaxed. In this paper, we propose a training strategy that does not require clean signals. The proposed method only utilizes noisy signals for training, which enables us to use a variety of speech signals in the wild. Our experimental results showed that the proposed method can achieve the performance similar to that of a DNN trained with clean signals.",2021-01-21T14:14:21Z,2021-05-10T05:56:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08625v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08625v2,eess.AS
On the Concept of Frequency in Signal Processing,"M√≥ises Soto-Bajo, Andr√©s Fraguela Collar, Javier Herrera Vega, Ra√∫l Felipe-Sosa","Frequency is a central concept in Mathematics, Physics, and Signal Processing. It is the main tool for describing the oscillatory behavior of signals, which is usually argued to be the manifestation of some of their key features, depending on their nature. For instance, this is the case of Electroencephalographic signals. Hence, frequency is substantially present in the most common methodologies for analyzing signals, as the Fourier Analysis or the Time-Frequency Analysis. However, in spite of its importance as a keystone in Signal Processing, and its seemingly simple meaning, its mathematical foundation is not as straightforward as it may seem at first glance. A naive interpretation of the different mathematical concepts modelling frequency can be misleading, as their actual meanings essentially differ from the intuitive notion which are supposed to represent. In our opinion, this circumstance should be taken into account in order to develop appropriate signal analyzing and processing tools in some applications. In the current text we discuss this topic, with the main goal to draw the attention of the mathematical and engineering community to this point,often overlooked.",2021-05-24T17:31:27Z,2021-05-24T17:31:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13177v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13177v1,eess.SP
Generalized autocorrelation analysis for multi-target detection,"Ye'Ela Shalit, Ran Weber, Asaf Abas, Shay Kreymer, Tamir Bendory","We study the multi-target detection problem of recovering a target signal from a noisy measurement that contains multiple copies of the signal at unknown locations. Motivated by the structure reconstruction problem in cryo-electron microscopy, we focus on the high noise regime, where noise hampers accurate detection of signal occurrences. Previous works proposed an autocorrelation analysis framework to estimate the signal directly from the measurement, without detecting signal occurrences. Specifically, autocorrelation analysis entails finding a signal that best matches the observable autocorrelations by minimizing a least squares objective. This paper extends this line of research by developing a generalized autocorrelation analysis framework that replaces the least squares by a weighted least squares. The optimal weights can be computed directly from the data and guarantee favorable statistical properties. We demonstrate signal recovery from highly noisy measurements, and show that the proposed framework outperforms autocorrelation analysis in a wide range of parameters.",2021-09-24T08:54:24Z,2021-09-24T08:54:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11813v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11813v1,eess.SP
Wide-Sense Stationarity in Generalized Graph Signal Processing,"Xingchao Jian, Wee Peng Tay","We consider statistical graph signal processing (GSP) in a generalized framework where each vertex of a graph is associated with an element from a Hilbert space. This general model encompasses various signals such as the traditional scalar-valued graph signal, multichannel graph signal, and discrete- and continuous-time graph signals, allowing us to build a unified theory of graph random processes. We introduce the notion of joint wide-sense stationarity in this generalized GSP framework, which allows us to characterize a graph random process as a combination of uncorrelated oscillation modes across both the vertex and Hilbert space domains. We elucidate the relationship between the notions of wide-sense stationarity in different domains, and derive the Wiener filters for denoising and signal completion under this framework. Numerical experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the utility of our generalized approach in achieving better estimation performance compared to traditional GSP or the time-vertex framework.",2021-12-02T11:04:24Z,2022-09-08T12:58:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01127v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01127v2,eess.SP
Topological Signal Processing over Cell Complexes,"Stefania Sardellitti, Sergio Barbarossa, Lucia Testa","The Topological Signal Processing (TSP) framework has been recently developed to analyze signals defined over simplicial complexes, i.e. topological spaces represented by finite sets of elements that are closed under inclusion of subsets [1]. However, the same inclusion property represents sometimes a too rigid assumption that prevents the application of simplicial complexes to many cases of interest. The goal of this paper is to extend TSP to the analysis of signals defined over cell complexes, which represent a generalization of simplicial complexes, as they are not restricted to satisfy the inclusion property. In particular, the richer topological structure of cell complexes enables them to reveal cycles of any order, as representative of data features. We propose an efficient method to infer the topology of cell complexes from data by showing how their use enables sparser edge signal representations than simplicial-based methods. Furthermore, we show how to design optimal finite impulse response (FIR) filters operating on solenoidal and irrotational signals in order to minimize the approximation error with respect to the desired spectral masks.",2021-12-13T14:49:11Z,2021-12-13T14:49:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06709v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06709v1,eess.SP
Covariance Recovery for One-Bit Sampled Data With Time-Varying Sampling   Thresholds-Part I: Stationary Signals,"Arian Eamaz, Farhang Yeganegi, Mojtaba Soltanalian","One-bit quantization, which relies on comparing the signals of interest with given threshold levels, has attracted considerable attention in signal processing for communications and sensing. A useful tool for covariance recovery in such settings is the arcsine law, that estimates the normalized covariance matrix of zero-mean stationary input signals. This relation, however, only considers a zero sampling threshold, which can cause a remarkable information loss. In this paper, the idea of the arcsine law is extended to the case where one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) apply time-varying thresholds. Specifically, three distinct approaches are proposed, investigated, and compared, to recover the autocorrelation sequence of the stationary signals of interest. Additionally, we will study a modification of the Bussgang law, a famous relation facilitating the recovery of the cross-correlation between the one-bit sampled data and the zero-mean stationary input signal. Similar to the case of the arcsine law, the Bussgang law only considers a zero sampling threshold. This relation is also extended to accommodate the more general case of time-varying thresholds for the stationary input signals.",2022-03-16T16:14:43Z,2022-03-16T16:14:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09460v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.09460v1,eess.SP

Therefore, the conventional snapshot could be reconstructed by analyzing the spectrum of the combined signal. Then spatial spectrum estimation method is used to implement DOA estimation. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. Since the duration of the signal in the frequency domain analysis processed in a single time is very short, this method is also applicable to narrowband signals.

Graph Signal Sampling Under Stochastic Priors,"Junya Hara, Yuichi Tanaka, Yonina C. Eldar","We propose a generalized sampling framework for stochastic graph signals. Stochastic graph signals are characterized by graph wide sense stationarity (GWSS) which is an extension of wide sense stationarity (WSS) for standard time-domain signals. In this paper, graph signals are assumed to satisfy the GWSS conditions and we study their sampling as well as recovery procedures. In generalized sampling, a correction filter is inserted between sampling and reconstruction operators to compensate for non-ideal measurements. We propose a design method for the correction filters to reduce the mean-squared error (MSE) between original and reconstructed graph signals. We derive the correction filters for two cases: The reconstruction filter is arbitrarily chosen or predefined. The proposed framework allows for arbitrary sampling methods, i.e., sampling in the vertex or graph frequency domain. We also show that the graph spectral response of the resulting correction filter parallels that for generalized sampling for WSS signals if sampling is performed in the graph frequency domain. Furthermore, we reveal the theoretical connection between the proposed and existing correction filters. The effectiveness of our approach is validated via experiments by comparing its MSE with existing approaches.",2022-06-01T10:34:54Z,2022-11-24T09:16:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00382v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00382v2,eess.SP

Power consumption and cost of an ADC are directly proportional to the sampling rate; hence, it is desirable to keep it as low as possible. The dynamic range of an ADC also plays an important role, and ideally, it should be greater than the signal's; otherwise, the signal will be clipped. To avoid clipping, modulo folding can be used before sampling, followed by an unfolding algorithm to recover the true signal. In this paper, we present a modulo hardware prototype that can be used before sampling to avoid clipping. Our modulo hardware operates prior to the sampling mechanism and can fold higher frequency signals compared to existing hardware. We present a detailed design of the hardware and also address key issues that arise during implementation. In terms of applications, we show the reconstruction of finite-rate-of-innovation signals which are beyond the dynamic range of the ADC.

Open Set Wireless Signal Classification: Augmenting Deep Learning with   Expert Feature Classifiers,"Samuel R. Shebert, Benjamin H. Kirk, R. Michael Buehrer","In shared spectrum with multiple radio access technologies, wireless standard classification is vital for applications such as dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and wideband spectrum monitoring. However, interfering signals and the presence of unknown classes of signals can diminish classification accuracy. To reduce interference, signals can be isolated in time, frequency, and space, but the isolation process adds distortion that reduces the accuracy of deep learning classifiers. We find that the distortion can be partially mitigated by augmenting the classifier training data with the signal isolation steps. To address unknown signals, we propose an open set hybrid classifier, which combines deep learning and expert feature classifiers to leverage the reliability and explainability of expert feature classifiers and the lower computational complexity of deep learning classifiers. The hybrid classifier reduces the computational complexity by 2 to 7 times on average compared to the expert feature classifiers, while achieving an accuracy of 95% at 15 dB SNR for known signal classes. The hybrid classifier manages to detect unknown classes at nearly 100% accuracy, due to the robustness of the expert feature classifiers.",2023-02-07T20:54:18Z,2023-02-07T20:54:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03749v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03749v1,eess.SP

Blind Graph Matching Using Graph Signals,"Hang Liu, Anna Scaglione, Hoi-To Wai","Classical graph matching aims to find a node correspondence between two unlabeled graphs of known topologies. This problem has a wide range of applications, from matching identities in social networks to identifying similar biological network functions across species. However, when the underlying graphs are unknown, the use of conventional graph matching methods requires inferring the graph topologies first, a process that is highly sensitive to observation errors. In this paper, we tackle the blind graph matching problem with unknown underlying graphs directly using observations of graph signals, which are generated from graph filters applied to graph signal excitations. We propose to construct sample covariance matrices from the observed signals and match the nodes based on the selected sample eigenvectors. Our analysis shows that the blind matching outcome converges to the result obtained with known graph topologies when the signal sampling size is large and the signal noise is small. Numerical results showcase the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm compared to matching two estimated underlying graphs learned from the graph signals.",2023-06-27T18:59:31Z,2024-03-30T00:47:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15747v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15747v3,eess.SP
NeuroHeed: Neuro-Steered Speaker Extraction using EEG Signals,"Zexu Pan, Marvin Borsdorf, Siqi Cai, Tanja Schultz, Haizhou Li","Humans possess the remarkable ability to selectively attend to a single speaker amidst competing voices and background noise, known as selective auditory attention. Recent studies in auditory neuroscience indicate a strong correlation between the attended speech signal and the corresponding brain's elicited neuronal activities, which the latter can be measured using affordable and non-intrusive electroencephalography (EEG) devices. In this study, we present NeuroHeed, a speaker extraction model that leverages EEG signals to establish a neuronal attractor which is temporally associated with the speech stimulus, facilitating the extraction of the attended speech signal in a cocktail party scenario. We propose both an offline and an online NeuroHeed, with the latter designed for real-time inference. In the online NeuroHeed, we additionally propose an autoregressive speaker encoder, which accumulates past extracted speech signals for self-enrollment of the attended speaker information into an auditory attractor, that retains the attentional momentum over time. Online NeuroHeed extracts the current window of the speech signals with guidance from both attractors. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuroHeed effectively extracts brain-attended speech signals, achieving high signal quality, excellent perceptual quality, and intelligibility in a two-speaker scenario.",2023-07-26T17:07:27Z,2023-07-26T17:07:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14303v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14303v1,eess.AS
Bearing damage detection with orthogonal and non-negative low-rank   feature extraction,"Mateusz Gabor, Rafal Zdunek, Agnieszka Wylomanska, Radoslaw Zimroz","Local damage of bearings can be detected as a weak cyclic and impulsive component in a highly noisy measured signal. A key problem is how to extract the signal of interest (SOI) from the raw signal, i.e., how to identify and design an optimal filter. To tackle this problem, we propose to use stochastic sampled orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization for extracting frequency-based features from a spectrogram of the measured signal. The proposed algorithm finds a selective filter that is tailored to the frequency band of the SOI. We show that our approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art selectors that were previously used in condition monitoring. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated using both a simulation study and the following real signals: (a) vibration signal from a test rig in the laboratory and (b) acoustic signal from a belt conveyor.",2024-03-19T09:20:17Z,2024-03-19T09:20:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12564v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12564v1,eess.SP
Subsampling of Correlated Graph Signals,"Rishabh Ravi, Kaushani Majumder, Kalp Vyas, Satish Mulleti","Graph signals are functions of the underlying graph. When the edge-weight between a pair of nodes is high, the corresponding signals generally have a higher correlation. As a result, the signals can be represented in terms of a graph-based generative model. The question then arises whether measurements can be obtained on a few nodes and whether the correlation structure between the signals can be used to reconstruct the graph signal on the remaining nodes. We show that node subsampling is always possible for graph signals obtained through a generative model. Further, a method to determine the number of nodes to select is proposed based on the tolerable error. A correlation-based fast greedy algorithm is developed for selecting the nodes. Finally, we verify the proposed method on different deterministic and random graphs, and show that near-perfect reconstruction is possible with node subsampling.",2024-09-06T08:22:23Z,2024-09-06T08:22:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04107v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04107v1,eess.SP
Semantic Communications for Digital Signals via Carrier Images,"Zhigang Yan, Dong Li","Most of current semantic communication (SemCom) frameworks focus on the image transmission, which, however, do not address the problem on how to deliver digital signals without any semantic features. This paper proposes a novel SemCom approach to transmit digital signals by using the image as the carrier signal. Specifically, the proposed approach encodes the digital signal as a binary stream and maps it to mask locations on an image. This allows binary data to be visually represented, enabling the use of existing model, pre-trained Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are optimized for masked image reconstruction, as the SemCom encoder and decoder. Since MAE can both process and recover masked images, this approach allows for the joint transmission of digital signals and images without additional overhead. In addition, considering the mask tokens transmission encoded by the MAE still faces extra costs, we design a sparse encoding module at the transmitter to encode the mask tokens into a sparse matrix, and it can be recovered at the receiver. Thus, this approach simply needs to transmit the latent representations of the unmasked patches and a sparse matrix, which further reduce the transmission overhead compared with the original MAE encoder. Simulation results show that the approach maintains reliable transmission of digital signals and images even in a high mask ratio of transmitted images.",2024-12-10T04:13:54Z,2024-12-10T04:13:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07173v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07173v1,eess.SP
Fabrication of a Low-Cost Real-Time Mobile ECG System for Health   Monitoring,"Soheil Khooyooz, Mohammad Ali Ahmadi-Pajouh, Kamyab Azizi","The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is one of the most vital signals that can be used to investigate the performance of heart. Based on the ECG graph, we can identify different disorders and diseases. Therefore, monitoring this signal is of great importance. Many electrodes (usually 12) are employed to acquire this signal in clinics and hospitals; therefore, a nurse must install them on the body of the patient to record the signal. In this project, we built a device that can acquire the real-time ECG signal and display it on the mobile screen with the least number of electrodes (three electrodes) without requiring a nurse to install the electrodes using the simplest and cheapest type of ICs and transmitters including STM32F030F4P6 microcontroller, AD620 instrumentation amplifier, TL084 amplifier, TC7660 voltage converter, LM1117 regulator, and HC-05 Bluetooth module. Moreover, the device was designed in a way that could operate using a single 9V battery or power adaptor. First, to amplify the signal and remove a part of its noise, the ECG signal is given to the primary analog circuit. Then, in the digital section, using a microcontroller, the signal is discretized, processed, and finally transmitted to a mobile phone for final processing, information extraction, and displaying. In the mobile-written application, we developed a mathematical algorithm based on Pan-Tompkins algorithm to calculate the heartbeat rate, in which the signal peaks are determined after several processing steps using a threshold. In this regard, the ECG signals of 10 subjects were recorded and analyzed to calculate the optimum threshold. Finally, the power spectral density (PSD) and input referred noise were calculated and plotted to check the output signal quality. Based on the PSD and input referred noise amplitudes, we achieved a signal-to-noise ratio of 50dB.",2023-02-13T11:27:37Z,2023-02-13T11:27:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06272v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06272v1,eess.SP

We show that, quite generally, there is a component of the noise in such systems that can be traced to the random arrival of the signaling molecules at their receptor sites, and this diffusive noise is not reduced by cooperativity.

ICI-Free Channel Estimation and Wireless Gesture Recognition Based on   Cellular Signals,"Rui Peng, Yafei Tian, Shengqian Han","Device-free wireless sensing attracts enormous attentions since it senses the environment without additional devices.

The effect of feedback on the fidelity of information transmission of   time-varying signals,"Wiet de Ronde, Filipe Tostevin, Pieter Rein ten Wolde","Living cells are continually exposed to environmental signals that vary in time. These signals are detected and processed by biochemical networks, which are often highly stochastic. To understand how cells cope with a fluctuating environment, we therefore have to understand how reliably biochemical networks can transmit time-varying signals. To this end, we must understand both the noise characteristics and the amplification properties of networks. In this manuscript, we use information theory to study how reliably signalling cascades employing autoregulation and feedback can transmit time-varying signals. We calculate the frequency-dependence of the gain-to-noise ratio, which reflects how reliably a network transmits signals at different frequencies. We find that the gain-to-noise ratio may differ qualitatively from the power spectrum of the output, showing that the latter does not directly reflect signaling performance. Moreover, we find that auto-activation and auto-repression increase and decrease the gain-to-noise ratio for all of frequencies, respectively. Positive feedback specifically enhances information transmission at low frequencies, while negative feedback increases signal fidelity at high frequencies. Our analysis not only elucidates the role of autoregulation and feedback in naturally-occurring biological networks, but also reveals design principles that can be used for the reliable transmission of time-varying signals in synthetic gene circuits.",2010-02-12T16:51:56Z,2010-02-12T16:51:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2595v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.2595v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM"
From Cues to Signals: Evolution of Interspecific Communication Via   Aposematism and Mimicry in a Predator-Prey System,"Kenna D. S. Lehmann, Brian W. Goldman, Ian Dworkin, David M. Bryson, Aaron P. Wagner","Current evolutionary theory suggests that many natural signaling systems evolved from preexisting cues. In aposematic systems, prey warning signals benefit both predator and prey. When the signal is highly beneficial, a third species often evolves to mimic the unpalatable species, exploiting the signaling system for its own protection. We investigated the evolutionary development of predator cue utilization and prey signaling in a digital predator-prey system in which mimicking prey could evolve to alter their appearance to resemble poison-free or poisonous prey. In predators, we observed rapid evolution of cue recognition (i.e. active behavioral responses) when presented with sufficiently poisonous prey. In addition, active signaling (i.e. mimicry) evolved in prey under all conditions that led to cue utilization. Thus we show that despite imperfect and dishonest signaling, given a high cost of consuming poisonous prey, complex systems of interspecific communication can evolve via predator cue recognition and prey signal manipulation. This provides evidence supporting hypotheses that cues may serve as stepping-stones in the evolution of more advanced communication systems and signals incorporating information about the environment.",2013-09-11T15:11:01Z,2013-09-11T15:11:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2852v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2852v1,q-bio.PE
Tensor Completion from Regular Sub-Nyquist Samples,"Charilaos I. Kanatsoulis, Xiao Fu, Nicholas D. Sidiropoulos, Mehmet Ak√ßakaya","Signal sampling and reconstruction is a fundamental engineering task at the heart of signal processing. The celebrated Shannon-Nyquist theorem guarantees perfect signal reconstruction from uniform samples, obtained at a rate twice the maximum frequency present in the signal. Unfortunately a large number of signals of interest are far from being band-limited. This motivated research on reconstruction from sub-Nyquist samples, which mainly hinges on the use of random / incoherent sampling procedures. However, uniform or regular sampling is more appealing in practice and from the system design point of view, as it is far simpler to implement, and often necessary due to system constraints. In this work, we study regular sampling and reconstruction of three- or higher-dimensional signals (tensors). We show that reconstructing a tensor signal from regular samples is feasible. Under the proposed framework, the sample complexity is determined by the tensor rank---rather than the signal bandwidth. This result offers new perspectives for designing practical regular sampling patterns and systems for signals that are naturally tensors, e.g., images and video. For a concrete application, we show that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acceleration is a tensor sampling problem, and design practical sampling schemes and an algorithmic framework to handle it. Numerical results show that our tensor sampling strategy accelerates the fMRI sampling process significantly without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy.",2019-03-01T17:52:35Z,2019-03-01T17:52:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00435v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00435v1,eess.SP
A New Uncertainty Framework for Stochastic Signal Processing,"Rishabh Singh, Jose C. Principe","The fields of signal processing and information theory have evolved with the goal of developing formulations to extract intrinsic information from limited amount of data. When one considers the modeling of unpredictably varying processes and complex dynamical signals with a large number of unknowns (such as those encountered in the fields of finance, NLP, communications, etc.), there is a need for algorithms to have increased sensitivity with short spans of data, while maintaining stochastic generalization ability. This naturally calls for an increased focus on localized stochastic representation. So far, most metrics developed for characterizing signals envision data from entropic and probabilistic points of view that lack sensitivity towards quick changes in signal dynamics. We hypothesize that models that work with the intrinsic uncertainties associated with local data induced metric spaces would be significantly more sensitive towards signal characterization. To this end, we develop a new framework for stochastic signal processing that is based on decomposing the local metric space of the signal in a Gaussian Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A major advantage of our framework is that we are able to implement this decomposition on a sample-by-sample basis. The key aspects of our framework are the following: (1) We use a data defined metric related to Parzen density estimation for quantifying the local structure of data in the Gaussian RKHS. (2) We use a quantum description of this metric which consequently introduces uncertainty in the structure of the local kernel space. Since the RKHS has been well established and known for providing universal data fitting capabilities, we submit that local quantifiers of the kernel space data projection could significantly improve acquisition of signal information.",2019-04-30T03:34:40Z,2019-05-04T12:21:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13038v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.13038v2,eess.SP
Subthreshold signal encoding in coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons,"Maria Masoliver, Cristina Masoller","Despite intensive research, the mechanisms underlying how neurons encode external inputs remain poorly understood. Recent work has focused on the response of a single neuron to a weak, subthreshold periodic signal. By simulating the FitzHugh-Nagumo stochastic model and then using a symbolic method to analyze the firing activity of the neuron, preferred and infrequent spike patterns (defined by the relative timing of the spikes) were detected, whose probabilities encode information about the signal. As not individual neurons in isolation but neuronal populations are responsible for the emergence of complex behaviors, a relevant question is whether this coding mechanism is robust when the neuron is not isolated. We study how a second neuron, which does not perceive the subthreshold signal, affects the detection and the encoding of the signal, done by the first neuron. Through simulations of two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons we show that the coding mechanism is indeed robust, as the neuron that perceives the signal fires a spike train that has symbolic patterns whose probabilities depend on the features of the signal. Moreover, we show that the second neuron facilitates the detection of the signal, by lowering the firing threshold of the first neuron. This in turn decreases the internal noise level need to fire the spikes that encode the signal. We also show that the probabilities of the symbolic patterns achieve maximum or minimum values when the period of the external signal is close to (or is half of) the mean firing period of the neuron.",2017-11-22T14:55:33Z,2017-11-22T14:55:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08309v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08309v1,q-bio.NC
Observing and Tracking Bandlimited Graph Processes,"Elvin Isufi, Paolo Banelli, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Geert Leus","One of the most crucial challenges in graph signal processing is the sampling of bandlimited graph signals, i.e., signals that are sparse in a well-defined graph Fourier domain. So far, the prior art is mostly focused on (sub)sampling single snapshots of graph signals ignoring their evolution over time. However, time can bring forth new insights, since many real signals like sensor measurements, biological, financial, and network signals in general, have intrinsic correlations in both domains. In this work, {we fill this lacuna} by jointly considering the graph-time nature of graph signals, named \emph{graph processes} for two main tasks: \emph{i)} observability of graph processes; and \emph{ii)} tracking of graph processes via Kalman filtering; both from a (possibly time-varying) subset of nodes. A detailed mathematical analysis ratifies the proposed methods and provides insights into the role played by the different actors, such as the graph topology, the process bandwidth, and the sampling strategy. Moreover, (sub)optimal sampling strategies that jointly exploit the nature of the graph structure and graph process are proposed.

DOA and Polarization Estimation for Non-Circular Signals in 3-D   Millimeter Wave Polarized Massive MIMO Systems,"Liangtian Wan, Kaihui Liu, Ying-Chang Liang, Tong Zhu","In this paper, an algorithm of multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is proposed for two-dimensional (2-D) direction of- arrival (DOA) and polarization estimation of non-circular signal in three-dimensional (3-D) millimeter wave polarized largescale/ massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The traditional MUSIC-based algorithms can estimate either the DOA and polarization for circular signal or the DOA for non-circular signal by using spectrum search. By contrast, in the proposed algorithm only the DOA estimation needs spectrum search, and the polarization estimation has a closedform expression. First, a novel dimension-reduced MUSIC (DRMUSIC) is proposed for DOA and polarization estimation of circular signal with low computational complexity. Next, based on the quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named quaternion non-circular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed for parameter estimation of non-circular signal with high estimation accuracy. Then based on the DOA estimation result using QNC-MUSIC, the polarization estimation of non-circular signal is acquired by using the closed-form expression of the polarization estimation in DR-MUSIC. In addition, the computational complexity analysis shows that compared with the conventional DOA and polarization estimation algorithms, our proposed QNC-MUSIC and DRMUSIC have much lower computational complexity, especially when the source number is large. The stochastic Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of the 2-D DOA and polarization parameters of the non-circular signals is derived as well. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can improve the parameter estimation performance when the large-scale/massive MIMO systems are employed.",2017-12-15T09:22:30Z,2017-12-15T09:22:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05587v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05587v1,eess.SP
Biosignal Analysis with Matching-Pursuit Based Adaptive Chirplet   Transform,"Jie Cui, Dinghui Wang","Chirping phenomena, in which the instantaneous frequencies of a signal change with time, are abundant in signals related to biological systems. Biosignals are non-stationary in nature and the time-frequency analysis is a viable tool to analyze them. It is well understood that Gaussian chirplet function is critical in describing chirp signals. Despite the theory of adaptive chirplet transform (ACT) has been established for more than two decades and is well accepted in the community of signal processing, application of ACT to bio-/biomedical signal analysis is still quite limited, probably because that the power of ACT, as an emerging tool for biosignal analysis, has not yet been fully appreciated by the researchers in the field of biomedical engineering. In this paper, we describe a novel ACT algorithm based on the ""coarse-refinement"" scheme. Namely, the initial estimate of a chirplet is implemented with the matching-pursuit (MP) algorithm and subsequently it is refined using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which we coin as MPEM algorithm. We emphasize the robustness enhancement of the algorithm in face of noise, which is important to biosignal analysis, as they are usually embedded in strong background noise. We then demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by applying it to the analysis of representative biosignals, including visual evoked potentials (bioelectrical signals), audible heart sounds and bat ultrasonic echolocation signals (bioacoustic signals), and human speech. The results show that the MPEM algorithm provides more compact representation of signals under investigation and clearer visualization of their time-frequency structures, indicating considerable promise of ACT in biosignal analysis.

PAM-4 Transmission at 1550nm using Photonic Reservoir Computing   Post-processing,"Apostolos Argyris, Juli√°n Bueno, Ingo Fischer","The efficacy of data decoding in contemporary ultrafast fiber transmission systems is greatly determined by the capabilities of the signal processing tools that are used. The received signal must not exceed a certain level of complexity, beyond which the applied signal processing solutions become insufficient or slow. Moreover, the required signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal can be challenging, especially when adopting modulation formats with multi-level encoding. Lately, photonic reservoir computing (RC) - a hardware machine learning technique with recurrent connectivity - has been proposed as a post-processing tool that deals with deterministic distortions from fiber transmission. Here we show that RC post-processing is remarkably efficient for multilevel encoding and for the use of very high launched optical peak power for fiber transmission up to 14dBm. Higher power levels provide the desired high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values at the receiver end, at the expense of a complex nonlinear transformation of the transmission signal. Our demonstration evaluates a direct fiber communication link with 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) encoding and direct detection, without including optical amplification, dispersion compensation, pulse shaping or other digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. By applying RC post-processing on the distorted signal, we numerically estimate fiber transmission distances of 27km at 56Gb/s and of 5.5 km at 112Gb/s data encoding rates, while fulfilling the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) bit-error-rate (BER) limit for data recovery.

Studies on Generalized Fourier Representations and Phase Transforms,Pushpendra Singh,"Fourier representation (FR) is an indispensable mathematical formulation for modeling and analysis of physical phenomenon, engineering systems and signals in numerous applications. In this study, we present the generalized Fourier representation (GFR) that is completely based on the FR of a signal, and introduce the phase transform (PT) which is a special case of the GFR and a true generalization of the Hilbert transform. We derive the PT kernel to obtain any constant phase shift, discuss the various properties of the PT, and demonstrate that (i) a constant phase shift in a signal corresponds to variable time-delays in all harmonics, (ii) to obtain a constant time-delay in a signal, one need to provide variable phase shift in all harmonics, (iii) a constant phase shift is same as the constant time-delay only for single frequency sinusoid. The time derivative and time integral, including fractional order, of a signal can be obtained using the GFR. We propose to use discrete cosine transform (DCT) based implementation to avoid end artifacts due to discontinuities present in both end of the signal. We introduce fractional delay of a discrete time signal using the FR, and present the fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation of all the above proposed representations. Using the analytic wavelet transform (AWT), we propose wavelet phase transform (WPT) to obtain a desired phase-shift in a signal under-analysis, and propose the two representations of wavelet quadrature transform (WQT) which is special case of the WPT where phase-shift is $\pi/2$ radians.",2018-08-02T14:13:59Z,2018-09-02T17:28:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06550v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06550v2,eess.SP
Robust Time-Varying Graph Signal Recovery for Dynamic Physical Sensor   Network Data,"Eisuke Yamagata, Kazuki Naganuma, Shunsuke Ono","We propose a time-varying graph signal recovery method for estimating the true time-varying graph signal from corrupted observations by leveraging dynamic graphs. Most of the conventional methods for time-varying graph signal recovery have been proposed under the assumption that the underlying graph that houses the signals is static. However, in light of rapid advances in sensor technology, the assumption that sensor networks are time-varying like the signals is becoming a very practical problem setting. In this paper, we focus on such cases and formulate dynamic graph signal recovery as a constrained convex optimization problem that simultaneously estimates both time-varying graph signals and sparsely modeled outliers. In our formulation, we use two types of regularizations, time-varying graph Laplacian-based and temporal differencebased, and also separately modeled missing values with known positions and unknown outliers to achieve robust estimations from highly degraded data. In addition, an algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the optimization problem based on a primaldual splitting method. Extensive experiments on simulated drone remote sensing data and real-world sea surface temperature data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing methods.",2022-02-13T22:45:27Z,2024-12-01T05:22:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06432v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06432v3,eess.SP
Manifold Graph Signal Restoration using Gradient Graph Laplacian   Regularizer,"Fei Chen, Gene Cheung, Xue Zhang","In the graph signal processing (GSP) literature, graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) was used for signal restoration to promote piecewise smooth / constant reconstruction with respect to an underlying graph. However, for signals slowly varying across graph kernels, GLR suffers from an undesirable ""staircase"" effect. In this paper, focusing on manifold graphs -- collections of uniform discrete samples on low-dimensional continuous manifolds -- we generalize GLR to gradient graph Laplacian regularizer (GGLR) that promotes planar / piecewise planar (PWP) signal reconstruction. Specifically, for a graph endowed with sampling coordinates (e.g., 2D images, 3D point clouds), we first define a gradient operator, using which we construct a gradient graph for nodes' gradients in sampling manifold space. This maps to a gradient-induced nodal graph (GNG) and a positive semi-definite (PSD) Laplacian matrix with planar signals as the 0 frequencies. For manifold graphs without explicit sampling coordinates, we propose a graph embedding method to obtain node coordinates via fast eigenvector computation. We derive the means-square-error minimizing weight parameter for GGLR efficiently, trading off bias and variance of the signal estimate. Experimental results show that GGLR outperformed previous graph signal priors like GLR and graph total variation (GTV) in a range of graph signal restoration tasks.",2022-06-09T03:15:22Z,2024-04-05T03:43:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04245v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04245v6,eess.SP
Use Cases for Time-Frequency Image Representations and Deep Learning   Techniques for Improved Signal Classification,Mehmet Parlak,"Time-frequency images (TFIs) provide a joint time-frequency representation of a signal and have become an effective tool for analyzing, characterizing, and processing non-stationary signals. Deep learning (DL) techniques have become versatile for signal classification, enabling the automatic extraction of relevant features from raw data. In this paper, we present two use cases on the time-frequency transformation and deep learning techniques for signal classification, where signals are first pre-processed and transformed into TFIs, and their features are then extracted through deep learning neural networks and classification algorithms. The specific methods and algorithms used may vary depending on the particular application, therefore different methods for creating TFIs; the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Fourier-based Synchrosqueezing Transform (FSST), Wigner Ville distribution (WVD), Smoothed Pseudo-Wigner distribution (SPWD), Choi-Williams distribution (CWD), and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) are investigated.

The results of this research demonstrate that significant improvements in signal classification accuracy can be achieved by leveraging the combined power of TFIs, and deep learning models.

Robust Network Topology Inference and Processing of Graph Signals,Samuel Rey,"The abundance of large and heterogeneous systems is rendering contemporary data more pervasive, intricate, and with a non-regular structure. With classical techniques facing troubles to deal with the irregular (non-Euclidean) domain where the signals are defined, a popular approach at the heart of graph signal processing (GSP) is to: (i) represent the underlying support via a graph and (ii) exploit the topology of this graph to process the signals at hand. In addition to the irregular structure of the signals, another critical limitation is that the observed data is prone to the presence of perturbations, which, in the context of GSP, may affect not only the observed signals but also the topology of the supporting graph. Ignoring the presence of perturbations, along with the couplings between the errors in the signal and the errors in their support, can drastically hinder estimation performance. While many GSP works have looked at the presence of perturbations in the signals, much fewer have looked at the presence of perturbations in the graph, and almost none at their joint effect. While this is not surprising (GSP is a relatively new field), we expect this to change in the upcoming years. Motivated by the previous discussion, the goal of this thesis is to advance toward a robust GSP paradigm where the algorithms are carefully designed to incorporate the influence of perturbations in the graph signals, the graph support, and both. To do so, we consider different types of perturbations, evaluate their disruptive impact on fundamental GSP tasks, and design robust algorithms to address them.",2023-02-26T14:39:18Z,2023-12-21T16:49:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13325v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13325v3,eess.SP
Checking the Statistical Assumptions Underlying the Application of the   Standard Deviation and RMS Error to Eye-Movement Time Series: A Comparison   between Human and Artificial Eyes,"Lee Friedman, Timothy Hanson, Hal S. Stern, Oleg V. Komogortsev","Spatial precision is often measured using the standard deviation (SD) of the eye position signal or the RMS of the sample-to-sample differences (StoS) signal during fixation. As both measures emerge from statistical theory applied to time-series, there are certain statistical assumptions that accompany their use. It is intuitively obvious that the SD is most useful when applied to unimodal distributions. Both measures assume stationarity, which means that the statistical properties of the signals are stable over time. Both metrics assume the samples of the signals are independent. The presence of autocorrelation indicates that the samples in the time series are not independent. We tested these assumptions with multiple fixations from two studies, a publicly available dataset that included both human and artificial eyes (""HA Dataset"", N=224 fixations), and data from our laboratory of 4 subjects (""TXstate"", N=37 fixations). Many position signal distributions were multimodal (HA: median=32%, TXstate: median=100%). No fixation position signals were stationary. All position signals were statistically significantly autocorrelated (p < 0:01). Thus, the statistical assumptions of the SD were not met for any fixation. All StoS signals were unimodal. Some StoS signals were stationary (HA: 34%, TXstate: 24%). Almost all StoS signals were statistically significantly autocorrelated (p < 0:01). For TXstate, 3 of 37 fixations met all assumptions. Thus, the statistical assumptions of the RMS were generally not met. The general failure of these assumptions calls into question the appropriateness of the SD or the RMS-StoS as metrics of precision for eye-trackers.",2023-02-13T19:49:52Z,2023-02-13T19:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06004v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06004v1,q-bio.NC
Comparative Analysis of Kinetic Realizations of Insulin Signaling,"Patrick Vincent N. Lubenia, Eduardo R. Mendoza, Angelyn R. Lao","Several studies have developed dynamical models to understand the underlying mechanisms of insulin signaling, a signaling cascade that leads to the translocation of glucose, the human body's main source of energy. Fortunately, reaction network analysis allows us to extract properties of dynamical systems without depending on their model parameter values. This study focuses on the comparison of insulin signaling in healthy state (INSMS or INSulin Metabolic Signaling) and in type 2 diabetes (INRES or INsulin RESistance) using reaction network analysis. The analysis uses network decomposition to identify the different subsystems involved in insulin signaling (e.g., insulin receptor binding and recycling, GLUT4 translocation, and ERK signaling pathway, among others). Furthermore, results show that INSMS and INRES are similar with respect to some network, structo-kinetic, and kinetic properties. Their differences, however, provide insights into what happens when insulin resistance occurs. First, the variation in the number of species involved in INSMS and INRES suggests that when irregularities occur in the insulin signaling pathway, other complexes (and, hence, other processes) get involved, characterizing insulin resistance. Second, the loss of concordance exhibited by INRES suggests less restrictive interplay between the species involved in insulin signaling, leading to unusual activities in the signaling cascade. Lastly, GLUT4 losing its absolute concentration robustness in INRES may signify that the transporter has lost its reliability in shuttling glucose to the cell, inhibiting efficient cellular energy production. This study also suggests possible applications of the equilibria parametrization and network decomposition, resulting from the analysis, to potentially establish absolute concentration robustness in a species.",2023-07-07T10:25:54Z,2023-10-24T02:16:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03498v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03498v2,q-bio.MN
Wave-shape Function Model Order Estimation by Trigonometric Regression,"Joaquin Ruiz, Marcelo A. Colominas","The adaptive non-harmonic (ANH) model is a powerful tool to compactly represent oscillating signals with time-varying amplitude and phase, and non-sinusoidal oscillating morphology. Given good estimators of instantaneous amplitude and phase we can construct an adaptive model, where the morphology of the oscillation is described by the wave-shape function (WSF), a 2{\pi}-periodic more general periodic function. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the number of harmonic components of the WSF, a problem that remains underresearched, by adapting trigonometric regression model selection criteria into this context. We study the application of these criteria, originally developed in the context of stationary signals, to the case of signals with time-varying amplitudes and phases. We then incorporate the order estimation to the ANH model reconstruction procedure and analyze its performance for noisy AM-FM signals. Experimental results on synthethic signals indicate that these criteria enable the adaptive estimation of the waveform of non-stationary signals with non-sinusoidal oscillatory patterns, even in the presence of considerable amount of noise. We also apply our reconstruction procedure to the task of denoising simulated pulse wave signals and determine that the proposed technique performs competitively to other denoising schemes. We conclude this work by showing that our adaptive order estimation algorithm takes into account the interpatient waveform variability of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals by analyzing recordings from the Fantasia Database.",2023-09-26T19:12:42Z,2023-09-26T19:12:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15210v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15210v1,eess.SP
On the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of Vibration Signals: Analysis and   Signal Companding for an Efficient Remote Vibration-Based Condition   Monitoring,"Sulaiman Aburakhia, Abdallah Shami","Vibration-based condition monitoring (VBCM) is widely utilized in various applications due to its non-destructive nature. Recent advancements in sensor technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and computing have enabled the facilitation of reliable distributed VBCM where sensor nodes are deployed at multiple locations and connected wirelessly to monitoring centers. However, sensor nodes are typically constrained by limited power resources, necessitating control over the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the generated vibration signals. Effective control of PAPR is crucial to prevent nonlinear distortion and reduce power consumption within the node. Additionally, avoiding nonlinear distortion in the vibration signal and preserving its waveform is essential to ensure the reliability of condition monitoring. This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the PAPR of vibration signals in VBCM systems, evaluates the impact of nonlinear power amplification on the system performance, and proposes a lightweight autoencoder-based signal companding scheme to control the PAPR to improve power efficiency and mitigate the impact of nonlinear distortion. The proposed scheme employs a lightweight reconstruction autoencoder with a compression-based activation function in the source to compress the vibration signals and avoid increasing the average power of the compressed signal. In the destination, the proposed scheme uses a denoising-expansion autoencoder to expand the compressed signals while minimizing noise enhancement during the expansion process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed companding scheme in preventing nonlinear distortion, improving the efficiency of power amplification in the source, and restoring the PAPR characteristics in the destination while avoiding the undesired effect of noise expansion.",2023-10-03T01:04:41Z,2023-10-03T01:04:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01718v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01718v1,eess.SP
supDQN: Supervised Rewarding Strategy Driven Deep Q-Network for sEMG   Signal Decontamination,"Ashutosh Jena, Naveen Gehlot, Rajesh Kumar, Ankit Vijayvargiya, Mahipal Bukya","The presence of muscles throughout the active parts of the body such as the upper and lower limbs, makes electromyography-based human-machine interaction prevalent. However, muscle signals are stochastic and noisy. These noises can be regular and irregular. Irregular noises due to movements or electrical switching require dynamic filtering. Conventionally, filters are stacked, which trims and delays the signal unnecessarily. This study introduces a decontamination technique involving a supervised rewarding strategy to drive a deep Q-network-based agent (supDQN). It applies one of three filters to decontaminate a 1sec long surface electromyography signal, which is dynamically contaminated. A machine learning agent identifies whether the signal after filtering is clean or noisy. Accordingly, a reward is generated. The identification accuracy is enhanced by using a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation. The deep Q-network is guided by this reward to select filter optimally while decontaminating a signal. The proposed filtering strategy is tested on four noise levels (-5 dB, -1 dB, +1 dB, +5 dB). supDQN filters the signal desirably when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is between -5 dB to +1 dB. It filters less desirably at high SNR (+5 dB). A normalized root mean square (nRMSE) is formulated to depict the difference of filtered signal from ground truth. This is used to compare supDQN and conventional methods including wavelet denoising with debauchies and symlet wavelet, high order low pass filter, notch filter, and high pass filter. The proposed filtering strategy gives an average value nRMSE of 1.1974, which is lower than the conventional filters.",2024-05-09T16:16:14Z,2024-05-09T16:16:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05883v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05883v1,eess.SP
Diverging network architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome   and signaling network,"Sophie Dvali, Caio Seguin, Richard Betzel, Andrew M. Leifer","The connectome describes the complete set of synaptic contacts through which neurons communicate. While the architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome has been extensively characterized, much less is known about the organization of causal signaling networks arising from functional interactions between neurons. Understanding how effective communication pathways relate to or diverge from the underlying structure is a central question in neuroscience. Here, we analyze the modular architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ signal propagation network, measured via calcium imaging and optogenetics, and compare it to the underlying anatomical wiring measured by electron microscopy. Compared to the connectome, we find that signaling modules are not aligned with the modular boundaries of the anatomical network, highlighting an instance where function deviates from structure. An exception to this is the pharynx which is delineated into a separate community in both anatomy and signaling. We analyze the cellular compositions of the signaling architecture and find that its modules are enriched for specific cell types and functions, suggesting that the network modules are neurobiologically relevant. Lastly, we identify a ""rich club"" of hub neurons in the signaling network. The membership of the signaling rich club differs from the rich club detected in the anatomical network, challenging the view that structural hubs occupy positions of influence in functional (signaling) networks. Our results provide new insight into the interplay between brain structure, in the form of a complete synaptic-level connectome, and brain function, in the form of a system-wide causal signal propagation atlas.",2024-12-19T03:46:31Z,2024-12-19T03:46:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14498v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14498v1,q-bio.NC
Signaling Design for Noncoherent Distributed Integrated Sensing and   Communication Systems,"Kawon Han, Kaitao Meng, Christos Masouros","The ultimate goal of enabling sensing through the cellular network is to obtain coordinated sensing of an unprecedented scale, through distributed integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC). This, however, introduces challenges related to synchronization and demands new transmission methodologies. In this paper, we propose a transmit signal design framework for D-ISAC systems, where multiple ISAC nodes cooperatively perform sensing and communication without requiring phase-level synchronization. The proposed framework employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) jointly designs downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) communication signals and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar signals, leveraging both collocated and distributed MIMO radars to estimate angle-of-arrival (AOA) and time-of-flight (TOF) from all possible multi-static measurements for target localization. To design the optimal D-ISAC transmit signal, we use the target localization Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as the sensing performance metric and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as the communication performance metric. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the localization CRB while maintaining a minimum SINR requirement for each communication user. Moreover, we present three distinct transmit signal design approaches, including optimal, orthogonal, and beamforming designs, which reveal trade-offs between ISAC performance and computational complexity. Unlike single-node ISAC systems, the proposed D-ISAC designs involve per-subcarrier sensing signal optimization to enable accurate TOF estimation, which contributes to the target localization performance. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs in achieving flexible ISAC trade-offs and efficient D-ISAC signal transmission.",2025-01-30T11:03:13Z,2025-01-30T11:03:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18264v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18264v1,eess.SP
Signal-adapted decomposition of graph signals,"Harry H. Behjat, Carl-Fredrik Westin, Rik Ossenkoppele, Dimitri Van De Ville","Analysis of signals defined on complex topologies modeled by graphs is a topic of increasing interest. Signal decomposition plays a crucial role in the representation and processing of such information, in particular, to process graph signals based on notions of scale (e.g., coarse to fine). The graph spectrum is more irregular than for conventional domains; i.e., it is influenced by graph topology, and, therefore, assumptions about spectral representations of graph signals are not easy to make. Here, we propose a tight frame design that is adapted to the graph Laplacian spectral content of given classes of graph signals. The design is based on using the ensemble energy spectral density, a notion of spectral content of given signal sets that we determine either directly using the graph Fourier transform or indirectly through a polynomial-based approximation scheme. The approximation scheme has the benefit that (i) it does not require eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix making the method feasible for large graphs, and (ii) it leads to a smooth estimate of the spectral content. A prototype system of spectral kernels each capturing an equal amount of energy is initially defined and subsequently warped using the signal set's ensemble energy spectral density such that the resulting subbands each capture an equal amount of ensemble energy. This approach accounts at the same time for graph topology and signal features, and it provides a meaningful interpretation of subbands in terms of coarse-to-fine representations. We also show how more simplified designs of signal-adapted decomposition of graph signals can be adopted based on ensemble energy estimates. We show the application of proposed methods on the Minnesota road graph and three different designs of brain graphs derived from neuroimaging data.",2025-02-17T14:39:52Z,2025-02-17T14:39:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11845v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11845v1,eess.SP
Synaptic Transmission: An Information-Theoretic Perspective,"A. Manwani, C. Koch","Here we analyze synaptic transmission from an information-theoretic perspective. We derive closed-form expressions for the lower-bounds on the capacity of a simple model of a cortical synapse under two explicit coding paradigms. Under the ``signal estimation'' paradigm, we assume the signal to be encoded in the mean firing rate of a Poisson neuron. The performance of an optimal linear estimator of the signal then provides a lower bound on the capacity for signal estimation. Under the ``signal detection'' paradigm, the presence or absence of the signal has to be detected. Performance of the optimal spike detector allows us to compute a lower bound on the capacity for signal detection. We find that single synapses (for empirically measured parameter values) transmit information poorly but significant improvement can be achieved with a small amount of redundancy.",1998-09-22T20:07:14Z,1998-09-22T20:07:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0309030v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0309030v1,q-bio.NC
Signal buffering in random networks of spiking neurons: microscopic vs.   macroscopic phenomena,"Julien Mayor, Wulfram Gerstner","In randomly connected networks of pulse-coupled elements a time-dependent input signal can be buffered over a short time. We studied the signal buffering properties in simulated networks as a function of the networks state, characterized by both the Lyapunov exponent of the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic activity derived from mean-field theory. If all network elements receive the same signal, signal buffering over delays comparable to the intrinsic time constant of the network elements can be explained by macroscopic properties and works best at the phase transition to chaos. However, if only 20 percent of the network units receive a common time-dependent signal, signal buffering properties improve and can no longer be attributed to the macroscopic dynamics.",2005-02-23T10:23:04Z,2005-02-23T10:23:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0502031v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0502031v1,q-bio.NC
Predictive Estimation of the Optimal Signal Strength from Unmanned   Aerial Vehicle over Internet of Things Using ANN,"S. H. Alsamhi, Ou Ma, M. S.

Prediction of the signal strength and fading channel conditions enable adaptive data transmission which turn enhances the QoS for the end users/ devices with reducing the power consumption for data transmissions. UAV is data gathering robot from the difficult or impossible area for humans to reach. Hence, Atmospheric dynamics and environment influence the signal strength during traveling in space among UAV, IoT devices, and humankind. Therefore, Signal moving from the smart UAV is sensitive to the effects of attenuation, reflection, diffraction, scattering, and shadowing. We analysis the ability ANN to predictively estimate the signal strength and channel propagation from the drone and physical medium parameters, using ANN.

Signal Space Cognitive Cooperation,"Eylem Erdogan, Ali Afana, Hamza U. Sokun, Salama Ikki, Lutfiye Durak-Ata, Halim Yanikomeroglu","In this work, a new transmission scheme, signal space cognitive cooperation, is introduced by applying the idea of signal space diversity in an underlay spectrum sharing decode-and-forward multi-relay cooperative network. In the proposed structure, the secondary source signal is rotated by a certain angle and then the source and the secondary best relay transmit the in-phase and the quadrature components of the rotated signal. As a consequence, two source signals, rather than one, are transmitted in two-time slots which improves data rates considerably, compared to the conventional cognitive cooperative schemes. In this work, proactive relaying mode is used in which the best relay is selected based on the max-min selection criterion before executing the transmission. Considering both statistical and the instantaneous channel state information of the feedback channel between the primary receiver and the secondary network, two power allocation methods are adopted at the source. For both methods, closed-form expressions of error probability are derived. Moreover, asymptotic analysis is performed and diversity gain is obtained to provide further insights about the system performance.

A Deep Learning Approach for Automotive Radar Interference Mitigation,"Jiwoo Mun, Heasung Kim, Jungwoo Lee","In automotive systems, a radar is a key component of autonomous driving. Using transmit and reflected radar signal by a target, we can capture the target range and velocity. However, when interference signals exist, noise floor increases and it severely affects the detectability of target objects. For these reasons, previous studies have been proposed to cancel interference or reconstruct original signals. However, the conventional signal processing methods for canceling the interference or reconstructing the transmit signals are difficult tasks, and also have many restrictions. In this work, we propose a novel approach to mitigate interference using deep learning. The proposed method provides high performance in various interference conditions and has low processing time.

In this paper we propose and demonstrate a new scheme to transfer both time and radio frequency with the same wavelength based on coherent demodulation technique. Time signal is encoded as a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) to the optical carrier using electro optic modulator (EOM) by phase modulation and makes sure the frequency signal free from interference with single pulse. The phase changes caused by the fluctuations of the transfer links are actively cancelled at local site by optical delay lines. Radio frequency with 1GHz and time signal with one pulse per second (1PPS) transmitted over a 110km fiber spools are obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that frequency instabilities of 1.7E-14 at 1s and 5.9E-17 at 104s. Moreover, time interval transfer of 1PPS signal reaches sub-ps stability after 1000s.

Uplink Time Scheduling with Power Level Modulation in Wireless Powered   Communication Networks,"Yeongwoo Ko, Sang-Hyo Kim, Jong-Seon No","In this paper, we propose downlink signal design and optimal uplink scheduling for the wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). Prior works give attention to resource allocation in a static channel because users are equipped with only energy receiver and users cannot update varying uplink schedulling. For uplink scheduling, we propose a downlink signal design scheme, called a power level modulation, which conveys uplink scheduling information to users. First, we design a downlink energy signal using power level modulation. Hybrid-access point (H-AP) allocates different power level in each subslot of the downlink energy signal according to channel condition and users optimize their uplink time subslots for signal transmission based on the power levels of their received signals. Further, we formulate the sum throughput maximization problem for the proposed scheme by determining the uplink and downlink time allocation using convex optimization problem.

Constrained Sampling: Optimum Reconstruction in Subspace with Minimax   Regret Constraint,"Bashir Sadeghi, Runyi Yu, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti","This paper considers the problem of optimum reconstruction in generalized sampling-reconstruction processes (GSRPs). We propose constrained GSRP, a novel framework that minimizes the reconstruction error for inputs in a subspace, subject to a constraint on the maximum regret-error for any other signal in the entire signal space. This framework addresses the primary limitation of existing GSRPs (consistent, subspace and minimax regret), namely, the assumption that the \emph{a priori} subspace is either fully known or fully ignored. We formulate constrained GSRP as a constrained optimization problem, the solution to which turns out to be a convex combination of the subspace and the minimax regret samplings. Detailed theoretical analysis on the reconstruction error shows that constrained sampling achieves a reconstruction that is 1) (sub)optimal for signals in the input subspace, 2) robust for signals around the input subspace, and 3) reasonably bounded for any other signals with a simple choice of the constraint parameter. Experimental results on sampling-reconstruction of a Gaussian input and a speech signal demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",2018-12-19T06:40:58Z,2019-10-17T19:11:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07776v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07776v3,eess.SP

The control strategies are based on the identification of signaling $bottlenecks$, which are single nodes or strongly connected clusters of nodes that have a large impact on the signaling. We provide a theorem with bounds on the minimum number of nodes that guarantee controllability of bottlenecks consisting of strongly connected components. The control strategies are applied to the identification of sets of proteins that, when inhibited, selectively disrupt the signaling of cancer cells while preserving the signaling of normal cells.

Generalized Sampling on Graphs With Subspace and Smoothness Priors,"Yuichi Tanaka, Yonina C. Eldar","We propose a framework for generalized sampling of graph signals that parallels sampling in shift-invariant (SI) subspaces. This framework allows for arbitrary input signals, which are not constrained to be bandlimited. Furthermore, the sampling and reconstruction filters may be different. We present design methods of the correction filter that compensate for these differences and lead to closed form expressions in the graph frequency domain. In this study, we consider two priors on graph signals: The first is a subspace prior, where the signal is assumed to lie in a periodic graph spectrum (PGS) subspace. The PGS subspace is proposed as a counterpart of the SI subspace used in standard sampling theory. The second is a smoothness prior that imposes a smoothness requirement on the graph signal. We suggest the use of recovery techniques for when the recovery filter can be optimized and under a setting in which a predefined filter must be used. Sampling is performed in the graph frequency domain, which is a counterpart of ""sampling by modulation"" used in SI subspaces. We compare our approach with existing sampling techniques on graph signal processing. The effectiveness of the proposed generalized sampling approach is validated numerically through several experiments.",2019-05-11T03:57:09Z,2019-12-23T02:38:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04441v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04441v2,eess.SP
Quadratic Matrix Inequality Approach to Robust Adaptive Beamforming for   General-Rank Signal Model,"Yongwei Huang, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, Zhi-Quan Luo","The worst-case robust adaptive beamforming problem for general-rank signal model is considered. This is a nonconvex problem, and an approximate version of it (obtained by introducing a matrix decomposition on the presumed covariance matrix of the desired signal) has been well studied in the literature. Different from the existing literature, herein however the original beamforming problem is tackled. Resorting to the strong duality of linear conic programming, the robust adaptive beamforming problem for general-rank signal model is reformulated into an equivalent quadratic matrix inequality (QMI) problem. By employing a linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxation technique, the QMI problem is turned into a convex semidefinite programming problem. Using the fact that there is often a positive gap between the QMI problem and its LMI relaxation, an approximate algorithm is proposed to solve the robust adaptive beamforming in the QMI form. Besides, several sufficient optimality conditions for the nonconvex QMI problem are built. To validate our results, simulation examples are presented, which also demonstrate the improved performance of the new robust beamformer in terms of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.",2019-05-25T04:30:55Z,2019-05-25T04:30:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10519v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10519v1,eess.SP
Reconstruction of FRI Signals using Deep Neural Network Approaches,"Vincent C. H. Leung, Jun-Jie Huang, Pier Luigi Dragotti","Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) theory considers sampling and reconstruction of classes of non-bandlimited continuous signals that have a small number of free parameters, such as a stream of Diracs. The task of reconstructing FRI signals from discrete samples is often transformed into a spectral estimation problem and solved using Prony's method and matrix pencil method which involve estimating signal subspaces. They achieve an optimal performance given by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound yet break down at a certain peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). This is probably due to the so-called subspace swap event. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the subspace swap problem and investigate alternative approaches including directly estimating FRI parameters using deep neural networks and utilising deep neural networks as denoisers to reduce the noise in the samples. Simulations show significant improvements on the breakdown PSNR over existing FRI methods, which still outperform learning-based approaches in medium to high PSNR regimes.",2019-05-21T15:10:59Z,2020-04-22T19:17:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11935v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11935v2,eess.SP
Sparse Factorization-based Detection of Off-the-Grid Moving targets   using FMCW radars,"Gilles Monnoyer de Galland, Thomas Feuillen, Luc Vandendorpe, Laurent Jacques","In this paper, we investigate the application of continuous sparse signal reconstruction algorithms for the estimation of the ranges and speeds of multiple moving targets using an FMCW radar. Conventionally, to be reconstructed, continuous sparse signals are approximated by a discrete representation. This discretization of the signal's parameter domain leads to mismatches with the actual signal. While increasing the grid density mitigates these errors, it dramatically increases the algorithmic complexity of the reconstruction. To overcome this issue, we propose a fast greedy algorithm for off-the-grid detection of multiple moving targets. This algorithm extends existing continuous greedy algorithms to the framework of factorized sparse representations of the signals. This factorized representation is obtained from simplifications of the radar signal model which, up to a model mismatch, strongly reduces the dimensionality of the problem. Monte-Carlo simulations of a K-band radar system validate the ability of our method to produce more accurate estimations with less computation time than the on-the-grid methods and than methods based on non-factorized representations.",2021-02-09T19:01:34Z,2021-02-09T19:01:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05072v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05072v1,eess.SP
General Total Variation Regularized Sparse Bayesian Learning for Robust   Block-Sparse Signal Recovery,"Aditya Sant, Markus Leinonen, Bhaskar D.

We propose a novel Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) method for block-sparse recovery based on popular CS based regularizers with the function input variable related to total variation (TV). Contrary to conventional approaches that impose the regularization on the signal components, we regularize the SBL hyperparameters. This iterative TV-regularized SBL algorithm employs a majorization-minimization approach and reduces each iteration to a convex optimization problem, enabling a flexible choice of numerical solvers. The numerical results illustrate that the TV-regularized SBL algorithm is robust to the nature of the block structure and able to recover signals with both block-patterned and isolated components, proving useful for various signal recovery systems.",2021-02-13T02:03:49Z,2021-02-16T06:19:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06845v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06845v2,eess.SP

The validity and accuracy of the method are further verified via Ricker wavelet and forward model GPR de-noising experiments. The method of VMD is evaluated in comparison with traditional wavelet transform (WT) and EEMD (ensemble EMD) methods. The method is subsequently used to analyze a GPR signal from a practical engineering case.

This paper introduces a novel algorithm for the identification of spatial multiplexing (SM) and Alamouti coded (AL) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, which relies on the second-order signal cyclostationarity. Analytical expressions for the second-order cyclic statistics of SM-OFDM and AL-OFDM signals are derived and further exploited for the algorithm development.

An Adaptive Feature Extraction Algorithm for Classification of   Seismocardiographic Signals,"Amirtaha Taebi, Brian E Solar, Hansen A Mansy","This paper proposes a novel adaptive feature extraction algorithm for seismocardiographic (SCG) signals. The proposed algorithm divides the SCG signal into a number of bins, where the length of each bin is determined based on the signal change within that bin. For example, when the signal variation is steeper, the bins are shorter and vice versa. The proposed algorithm was used to extract features of the SCG signals recorded from 7 healthy individuals (Age: 29.4$\pm$4.5 years) during different lung volume phases. The output of the feature extraction algorithm was fed into a support vector machines classifier to classify SCG events into two classes of high and low lung volume (HLV and LLV). The classification results were compared with currently available non-adaptive feature extraction methods for different number of bins. Results showed that the proposed algorithm led to a classification accuracy of ~90%. The proposed algorithm outperformed the non-adaptive algorithm, especially as the number of bins was reduced. For example, for 16 bins, F1 score for the adaptive and non-adaptive methods were 0.91$\pm$0.05 and 0.63$\pm$0.08, respectively.",2018-03-27T22:06:10Z,2018-05-08T03:13:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10343v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10343v2,eess.SP

In this work, we utilize the indices of analog precoders to carry information and optimize the symbol vector sets used for each analog precoder activation state. Specifically, we firstly propose a joint optimization based signal shaping (JOSS) approach, in which the symbol vector sets used for all analog precoder activation states are jointly optimized by solving a series of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems. JOSS exhibits good performance, however, with a high computational complexity. To reduce the computational complexity, we then propose a full precoding based signal shaping (FPSS) method and a diagonal precoding based signal shaping (DPSS) method, where the full or diagonal digital precoders for all analog precoder activation states are optimized by solving two small-scale QCQP problems.

Experimental Investigation on the Friction-induced Vibration with   Periodic Characteristics in a Running-in Process under Lubrication,"Di Sun, Pengfei Xing, Guobin Li, Hongtao Gao, Sifan Yang, Honglin Gao, Hongpeng Zhang","This paper investigated the friction-induced vibration (FIV) behavior under the running-in process with oil lubrication. The FIV signal with periodic characteristics under lubrication was identified with the help of the squeal signal induced in an oil-free wear experiment and then extracted by the harmonic wavelet packet transform (HWPT). The variation of the FIV signal from running-in wear stage to steady wear stage was studied by its root mean square (RMS) values. The result indicates that the time-frequency characteristics of the FIV signals evolve with the wear process and can reflect the wear stages of the friction pairs. The RMS evolvement of the FIV signal is in the same trend to the composite surface roughness and demonstrates that the friction pair goes through the running-in wear stage and the steady wear stage. Therefore, the FIV signal with periodic characteristics can describe the evolvement of the running-in process and distinguish the running-in wear stage and the stable wear stage of the friction pair.",2021-11-15T17:05:10Z,2021-11-24T01:05:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07914v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07914v2,eess.SP

Within the scope of this contribution, we introduce the complex-valued Frequency Selective Extrapolation for fast image and video signal extrapolation. This algorithm iteratively generates a generic complex-valued model of the signal to be extrapolated as weighted superposition of Fourier basis functions. We further show that this algorithm is up to 10 times faster than the existent real-valued Frequency Selective Extrapolation that takes the real-valued nature of the input signals into account during the model generation. At the same time, the quality which is achievable by the complex-valued model generation is similar to the quality of the real-valued model generation.",2022-04-27T12:57:00Z,2022-04-27T12:57:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14193v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.14193v1,eess.IV

Shifting Maximum Eigenvalue Detection in Low SNR Environment,"Lin Zheng, Robert C. Qiu, Qing Feng, Xuebin Li","Maximum eigenvalue detection (MED) is an important application of random matrix theory in spectrum sensing and signal detection. However, in small signal-to-noise ratio environment, the maximum eigenvalue of the representative signal is at the edge of Marchenko-Pastur (M-P) law bulk and meets the Tracy-Widom distribution. Since the distribution of Tracy-Widom has no closed-form expression, it brings great difficulty in processing. In this paper, we propose a shifting maximum eigenvalue (SMED) algorithm, which shifts the maximum eigenvalue out of the M-P law bulk by combining an auxiliary signal associated with the signal to be detected. According to the random matrix theory, the shifted maximum eigenvalue is consistent with Gaussian distribution. The proposed SMED not only simplifies the detection algorithm, but also greatly improve the detection performance. In this paper, the performance of SMED, MED and trace (FMD) algorithm is analyzed and the theoretical performance comparisons are obtained.

Estimation of Parameters of Multiple Chirp Signal in presence of Heavy   Tailed Errors,"Swagata Nandi, Debasis Kundu","In this paper, we consider the estimation of the unknown parameters of the multiple chirp signal model in presence of additive error. The chirp signals are quite common in many areas of science and engineering, specially sonar, radar, audio signals etc. The observed signals are usually corrupted by noise. In different signal processing applications it is observed that the errors may be heavy tailed. In this paper it is assumed that the additive errors have mean zero but may not have finite variance and are independent and identically distributed. We consider the least squares estimators and the approximate least squares estimators which maximize a periodogram like function. It has been observed that both the estimators are strongly consistent. The asymptotic distribution of the least squares estimators is obtained under the assumption that the additive errors are from a symmetric stable distribution. The approximate least squares estimators have the same asymptotic distribution as the least squares estimators. We perform some numerical simulations to see how the proposed estimators work.

Signals as Parametric Curves: Application to Independent Component   Analysis and Blind Source Separation,"Birmingham Hang Guan, Anand Rangarajan","Images Stacks as Parametric Surfaces (ISPS) is a powerful model that was originally proposed for image registration. Being closely related to mutual information (MI) - the most classic similarity measure for image registration, ISPS works well across different categories of registration problems. The Signals as Parametric Curves (SPC) model is derived from ISPS extended to 1-dimensional signals. Blind Source Separation (BSS) is a classic problem in signal processing, where Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based approaches are popular and effective. Since MI plays an important role in ICA, based on the close relationship with MI, we apply SPC model to BSS in this paper, and propose a group of geometrical objective functions that are simple yet powerful, and serve as replacements of original MI-based objective functions. Motivated by the geometrical objective functions, we also propose a second-order-statistics approach, FT-PCA. Both geometrical objective functions and FT-PCA consider signals as functions instead of stochastic processes, make use of derivative information of signals, and do not rely on the independence assumption. In this paper, we discuss the reasonability of the assumptions of geometrical objective functions and FT-PCA, and show their effectiveness by synthetic experiments, comparing with other previous classic approaches.",2018-07-10T01:39:35Z,2018-07-10T01:39:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03442v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03442v1,eess.SP
Pleiotropy enables specific and accurate signaling in the presence of   ligand cross talk,"Duncan Kirby, Jeremy Rothschild, Matthew Smart, Anton Zilman","Living cells sense their environment through the binding of extra-cellular molecular ligands to cell surface receptors. Puzzlingly, vast numbers of signaling pathways exhibit a high degree of cross talk between different signals whereby different ligands act through the same receptor or shared components downstream. It remains unclear how a cell can accurately process information from the environment in such cross-wired pathways. We show that a feature which commonly accompanies cross talk - signaling pleiotropy (the ability of a receptor to produce multiple outputs) - offers a solution to the cross talk problem. In a minimal model we show that a single pleiotropic receptor can simultaneously identify and accurately sense the concentrations of arbitrary unknown ligands present individually or in a mixture. We calculate the fundamental limits of the signaling specificity and accuracy of such signaling schemes.

Unlimited Dynamic Range Analog-to-Digital Conversion,"Adithya Krishna, Sunil Rudresh, Vishal Shaw, Hemanth Reddy Sabbella, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula, Chetan Singh Thakur","Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) provide the link between continuous-time signals and their discrete-time counterparts, and the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem provides the mathematical foundation. Real-world signals have a variable amplitude range, whereas ADCs, by design, have a limited input dynamic range, which results in out-of-range signals getting clipped. In this paper, we propose an unlimited dynamic range ADC (UDR-ADC) that is based on the modulo operation (self-reset feature) to alleviate the problem of clipping. The self-reset feature allows for wrapping of the input amplitudes, which preserves the input dynamic range.

The WSST with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive WSST, was introduced very recently in the paper ""Adaptive synchrosqueezing transform with a time-varying parameter for non-stationary signal separation"". The well-separated conditions of non-stationary multicomponent signals with the adaptive WSST and a method to select the time-varying parameter were proposed in that paper. In addition, simulation experiments in that paper show that the adaptive WSST is very promising in estimating the instantaneous frequency of a multicomponent signal, and in accurate component recovery. However the theoretical analysis of the adaptive WSST has not been studied.

Decomposing non-stationary signals with time-varying wave-shape   functions,"Marcelo A.

The signal processing mission is further challenged if each component has an oscillatory pattern, or the wave-shape function, far from a sinusoidal function, and the oscillatory pattern is even changing from time to time. In practice, if multiple components exist, it is desirable to robustly decompose the signal into each component for various purposes, and extract desired dynamics information. Such challenges have raised a significant amount of interest in the past decade, but a satisfactory solution is still lacking. We propose a novel {\em nonlinear regression scheme} to robustly decompose a signal into its constituting multiple oscillatory components with time-varying frequency, amplitude and wave-shape function. We coined the algorithm {\em shape-adaptive mode decomposition (SAMD)}. In addition to simulated signals, we apply SAMD to two physiological signals, impedance pneumography and electroencephalography.

Compared to the conventional DCS algorithm, which only exploit the joint sparsity of the signals, the proposed approach takes the intra- and inter-scale dependencies among the wavelet coefficients into account to enable the utilization of the individual signal structure. Furthermore, the Bessel K-form (BKF) is used as the prior distribution which has a sharper peak at zero and heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution.

Spatial Signal Strength Prediction using 3D Maps and Deep Learning,"Enes Krijestorac, Samer Hanna, Danijela Cabric","Machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully applied to simulating complex physics by learning physics models thanks to large data. Inspired by the successes of ANNs in physics modeling, we use deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict the radio signal strength field in an urban environment. Our algorithm relies on samples of signal strength collected across the prediction space and a 3D map of the environment, which enables it to predict the scattering of radio waves through the environment. While already extensive body of research exists in spatial signal strength prediction, our approach differs from most existing approaches in that it does not require the knowledge of the transmitter location, it does not require side channel information such as attenuation and shadowing parameters, and it is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, to use 3D maps to accomplish the task of signal strength prediction. This algorithm is developed for the purpose of placement optimization of a UAV or mobile robot to maximize the signal strength to or from a stationary transceiver but it also holds relevance to dynamic spectrum access networks, cellular coverage design, power control algorithms, etc.",2020-11-06T21:10:30Z,2020-11-06T21:10:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03597v1,eess.SP
Empirical Evaluation of Typical Sparse Fast Fourier Transform Algorithms,"Bin Li, Zhikang Jiang, Jie Chen","Computing the Sparse Fast Fourier Transform(sFFT) of a K-sparse signal of size N has emerged as a critical topic for a long time. The sFFT algorithms decrease the runtime and sampling complexity by taking advantage of the signal inherent characteristics that a large number of signals are sparse in the frequency domain. More than ten sFFT algorithms have been proposed, which can be classified into many types according to filter, framework, method of location, method of estimation. In this paper, the technology of these algorithms is completely analyzed in theory. The performance ofthem is thoroughly tested and verified in practice.

Online Discriminative Graph Learning from Multi-Class Smooth Signals,"Seyed Saman Saboksayr, Gonzalo Mateos, Mujdat Cetin","Graph signal processing (GSP) is a key tool for satisfying the growing demand for information processing over networks. However, the success of GSP in downstream learning and inference tasks is heavily dependent on the prior identification of the relational structures. Graphs are natural descriptors of the relationships between entities of complex environments. The underlying graph is not readily detectable in many cases and one has to infer the topology from the observed signals. Firstly, we address the problem of graph signal classification by proposing a novel framework for discriminative graph learning. To learn discriminative graphs, we invoke the assumption that signals belonging to each class are smooth with respect to the corresponding graph while maintaining non-smoothness with respect to the graphs corresponding to other classes. Secondly, we extend our work to tackle increasingly dynamic environments and real-time topology inference. We develop a proximal gradient (PG) method which can be adapted to situations where the data are acquired on-the-fly. Beyond discrimination, this is the first work that addresses the problem of dynamic graph learning from smooth signals where the sought network alters slowly.

Wideband photonic interference cancellation based on free space optical   communication,"Yang Qi, Ben Wu","We propose and experimentally demonstrate an interference management system that removes wideband wireless interference by using photonic signal processing and free space optical communication. The receiver separates radio frequency interferences by upconverting the mixed signals to optical frequencies and processing the signals with the photonic circuits. Signals with GHz bandwidth are processed and separated in real-time. The reference signals for interference cancellation are transmitted in a free space optical communication link, which provides large bandwidth for multi-band operation and accelerates the mixed signal separation process by reducing the dimensions of the un-known mixing matrix. Experimental results show that the system achieves 30dB real-time cancellation depth with over 6GHz bandwidth. Multiple radio frequency bands can be processed at the same time with a single system.

This is sometimes a big issue for identifying critical model elements and describing the model dynamics. Thus, techniques of model reduction can be used as a mathematical tool in order to minimize the number of variables and parameters. In this thesis, we review some well-known methods of model reduction for cell signaling pathways. We have also developed some approaches that provide us a great step forward in model reduction. The techniques are quasi steady state approximation (QSSA), quasi equilibrium approximation (QEA), lumping of species and entropy production analysis.

An Olfactory EEG Signal Classification Network Based on Frequency Band   Feature Extraction,"Biao Sun, Zhigang Wei, Pei Liang, Huirang Hou","Classification of olfactory-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has shown great potential in many fields. Since different frequency bands within the EEG signals contain different information, extracting specific frequency bands for classification performance is important. Moreover, due to the large inter-subject variability of the EEG signals, extracting frequency bands with subject-specific information rather than general information is crucial. Considering these, the focus of this letter is to classify the olfactory EEG signals by exploiting the spectral-domain information of specific frequency bands. In this letter, we present an olfactory EEG signal classification network based on frequency band feature extraction. A frequency band generator is first designed to extract frequency bands via the sliding window technique. Then, a frequency band attention mechanism is proposed to optimize frequency bands for a specific subject adaptively. Last, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed to extract the spatio-spectral information and predict the EEG category. Comparison experiment results reveal that the proposed method outperforms a series of baseline methods in terms of both classification quality and inter-subject robustness.

Proportionate Adaptive Graph Signal Recovery,"Razieh Torkamani, Hadi Zayyani, Mehdi Korki","This paper generalizes the proportionate-type adaptive algorithm to the graph signal processing and proposes two proportionate-type adaptive graph signal recovery algorithms.

Preliminary Analysis of Skywave Effects on MF DGNSS R-Mode Signals   During Daytime and Nighttime,"Suhui Jeong, Pyo-Woong Son","Accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) performance are prerequisites for several technologies today. In a marine environment, it is difficult to visually identify one's position accurately, leading to safety concerns. Currently, PNT information is provided mainly from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS); however, it is vulnerable to radio frequency interference, spoofing, and ionospheric anomaly. Therefore, research on a backup system is needed. Ranging Mode (R-Mode), a terrestrial integrated navigation system, is being investigated for use in a marine environment. R-Mode is a positioning technology that integrates terrestrial signals of opportunity such as medium frequency (MF) differential GNSS (DGNSS), very high frequency (VHF) automatic identification system (AIS), and enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) signals. Previous studies in Europe show that signals in the MF band differ greatly in accuracy between daytime and nighttime. This difference is primarily caused by skywave. In this study, the MF DGNSS R-Mode signal transmitted from Chungju, Korea was received in Daesan and Daejeon, Korea. The skywave effect during daytime and nighttime was compared and investigated. In addition, the continuous wave intensity of the R-Mode signal was increased during the nighttime to compare its effect on the measurement accuracy.",2022-09-30T08:30:57Z,2022-09-30T08:30:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15306v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15306v1,eess.SP

Dynamic Sensor Placement Based on Sampling Theory for Graph Signals,"Saki Nomura, Junya Hara, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka","In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem where sensors can move within a network over time. Sensor placement problem aims to select K sensor positions from N candidates where K < N. Most existing methods assume that sensor positions are static, i.e., they do not move, however, many mobile sensors like drones, robots, and vehicles can change their positions over time. Moreover, underlying measurement conditions could also be changed, which are difficult to cover with statically placed sensors. We tackle the problem by allowing the sensors to change their positions in their neighbors on the network. We dynamically determine the sensor positions based on graph signal sampling theory such that the non-observed signals on the network can be best recovered from the observations. For signal recovery, the dictionary is learned from a pool of observed signals. It is also used for the sensor position selection. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method via the mean squared error of the reconstructed signals.

Alternating Deep Low-Rank Approach for Exponential Function   Reconstruction and Its Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Applications,"Yihui Huang, Zi Wang, Xinlin Zhang, Jian Cao, Zhangren Tu, Meijin Lin, Di Guo, Xiaobo Qu","Undersampling can accelerate the signal acquisition but at the cost of bringing in artifacts. Removing these artifacts is a fundamental problem in signal processing and this task is also called signal reconstruction. Through modeling signals as the superimposed exponential functions, deep learning has achieved fast and high-fidelity signal reconstruction by training a mapping from the undersampled exponentials to the fully sampled ones. However, the mismatch, such as the sampling rate of undersampling, the organ and the contrast of imaging, between the training and target data will heavily compromise the reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose Alternating Deep Low-Rank (ADLR), which combines deep learning solvers and classic optimization solvers. Experiments on the reconstruction of synthetic and realistic biomedical magnetic resonance signals demonstrate that ADLR can effectively mitigate the mismatch issue and achieve lower reconstruction errors than state-of-the-art methods.",2022-11-24T08:57:28Z,2024-08-14T03:42:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13479v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13479v4,eess.SP

By exploiting the task information for the overall system design, task-based quantization can achieve satisfying performance with low quantization costs. In this work, we apply task-based quantization to multi-user signal recovery and present a hardware prototype implementation.

Due to operating conditions, the frequency dependent characteristics of the system can be changed, and amplitude, phase, and time delay error can be generated. The proposed method is based on the concept of sliding window algorithm for linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals. To calibrate the frequency-dependent errors from transceiver and the time delay error from true time delay elements, the proposed method utilizes the characteristic of the LFM signal. The LFM signal changes its frequency linearly with time, and the frequency domain characteristics of the hardware are presented in time. Therefore, by applying matched filter to a part of the LFM signal, the frequency dependent characteristics can be monitored and calibrated. The proposed method is compared with the conventional matched filter based calibration results and verified by simulation results and beampatterns.

Automotive Radar Mutual Interference Mitigation Based on Hough Transform   in Time-Frequency Domain,"Yanbing Li, Weichuan Zhang, Lianying Ji","With the development of autonomous driving technology, automotive radar has received unprecedented attention due to its day-and-night and all-weather working capability. It is worthwhile to note that more and more vehicles are equipped with automotive radars, resulting in mutual interference between radars. The interference reduces radar target detection performance, making perception information unreliable. In this paper, a novel interference mitigation method based on power-weighted Hough transform is proposed for solving the radar mutual interference and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems. Firstly, the frequency modulation characteristics of interference signals and target echo signals are analyzed, and differences between the two signals are introduced. Secondly, based on the straight line detection technique, the power of the mutual interference signal in time-frequency domain is accumulated, and the accurate position of the interference is located. Finally, the target echo is recovered by autoregressive model.

However, when detecting the long-range target, the delay of echo signal exceeds CP duration, which will result in inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI), limiting the sensing range. Facing the above problem, we propose to increase useful signal power through coherent compensation and improve the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of each OFDM block.

Conventional solution of employing higher-power laser, or doing long-time signal averaging, may raise the system cost, time consumption, and tissue damage. Another strategy is de-noising algorithm design. In this paper, we propose a new de-noising method, termed gradient-based adaptive wavelet de-noising, which sets the energy gradient mutation point of low-frequency wavelet components as the threshold. We conducted simulation, ex vivo and in vivo experiments to validate the performance of the algorithm. The quality of de-noised PA image/signal by our proposed algorithm has improved by 20%-40%, in comparison to the traditional signal denoising algorithms, which produces better contrast and clearer details.

Online Signed Sampling of Bandlimited Graph Signals,"Wenwei Liu, Hui Feng, Feng Ji, Bo Hu","The theory of sampling and recovery of bandlimited graph signals has been extensively studied. However, in many cases, the observation of a signal is quite coarse. For example, users only provide simple comments such as ""like"" or ""dislike"" for a product on an e-commerce platform. This is a particular scenario where only the sign information of a graph signal can be measured. In this paper, we are interested in how to sample based on sign information in an online manner, by which the direction of the original graph signal can be estimated. The online signed sampling problem of a graph signal can be formulated as a Markov decision process in a finite horizon. Unfortunately, it is intractable for large size graphs. We propose a low-complexity greedy signed sampling algorithm (GSS) as well as a stopping criterion. Meanwhile, we prove that the objective function is adaptive monotonic and adaptive submodular, so that the performance is close enough to the global optimum with a lower bound. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the GSS algorithm by both synthesis and realworld data.",2024-02-16T07:55:28Z,2024-02-19T03:46:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10493v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10493v2,eess.SP
Automatic Radar Signal Detection and FFT Estimation using Deep Learning,"Akila Pemasiri, Zi Huang, Fraser Williams, Ethan Goan, Simon Denman, Terrence Martin, Clinton Fookes","This paper addresses a critical preliminary step in radar signal processing: detecting the presence of a radar signal and robustly estimating its bandwidth. Existing methods which are largely statistical feature-based approaches face challenges in electronic warfare (EW) settings where prior information about signals is lacking. While alternate deep learning based methods focus on more challenging environments, they primarily formulate this as a binary classification problem. In this research, we propose a novel methodology that not only detects the presence of a signal, but also localises it in the time domain and estimates its operating frequency band at that point in time. To achieve robust estimation, we introduce a compound loss function that leverages complementary information from both time-domain and frequency-domain representations. By integrating these approaches, we aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of radar signal detection and parameter estimation, reducing both unnecessary resource consumption and human effort in downstream tasks.",2024-02-29T11:54:48Z,2024-02-29T11:54:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19073v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19073v1,eess.SP
Spatially Selective Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Through Element   Permutation,"Fredrik Rusek, Jose Flordelis, Kun Zhao, Erik Bengtsson, Olof Zander","A standard reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can be configured to reflect signals from an arbitrary impinging direction to an arbitrary outgoing direction. However, if a signal impinges from any other direction, said signal is reflected, with full beamforming gain, to a specific direction, which is easily determined. The goal of this paper is to propose a RIS which \emph{only} reflects signals from the configured impinging direction. This can be accomplished by a RIS architecture that permutes the antenna elements in the sense that a signal is re-radiated from a different antenna than the one receiving the signal. We analytically prove this fact, and also discuss several variants and hardware implementations.",2024-03-06T11:36:44Z,2024-03-06T11:36:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03629v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03629v1,eess.SP
On Detecting Low-pass Graph Signals under Partial Observations,"Hoang-Son Nguyen, Hoi-To Wai","The application of graph signal processing (GSP) on partially observed graph signals with missing nodes has gained attention recently. This is because processing data from large graphs are difficult, if not impossible due to the lack of availability of full observations. Many prior works have been developed using the assumption that the generated graph signals are smooth or low pass filtered. This paper treats a blind graph filter detection problem under this context. We propose a detector that certifies whether the partially observed graph signals are low pass filtered, without requiring the graph topology knowledge. As an example application, our detector leads to a pre-screening method to filter out non low pass signals and thus robustify the prior GSP algorithms. We also bound the sample complexity of our detector in terms of the class of filters, number of observed nodes, etc. Numerical experiments verify the efficacy of our method.",2024-05-16T11:35:06Z,2024-05-16T11:35:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10001v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10001v1,eess.SP
Informed Graph Learning By Domain Knowledge Injection and Smooth Graph   Signal Representation,"Keivan Faghih Niresi, Lucas Kuhn, Ga√´tan Frusque, Olga Fink","Graph signal processing represents an important advancement in the field of data analysis, extending conventional signal processing methodologies to complex networks and thereby facilitating the exploration of informative patterns and structures across various domains. However, acquiring the underlying graphs for specific applications remains a challenging task. While graph inference based on smooth graph signal representation has become one of the state-of-the-art methods, these approaches usually overlook the unique properties of networks, which are generally derived from domain-specific knowledge. Overlooking this information could make the approaches less interpretable and less effective overall. In this study, we propose a new graph inference method that leverages available domain knowledge. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the task of denoising and imputing missing sensor data, utilizing graph signal reconstruction techniques. The results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into the graph inference process can improve graph signal reconstruction in district heating networks.

Jump Plus AM-FM Mode Decomposition,"Mojtaba Nazari, Anders Rosendal Korsh√∏j, Naveed ur Rehman","A novel method for decomposing a nonstationary signal into amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and discontinuous (jump) components is proposed. Current nonstationary signal decomposition methods are designed to either obtain constituent AM-FM oscillatory modes or the discontinuous and residual components from the data, separately. Yet, many real-world signals of interest simultaneously exhibit both behaviors i.e., jumps and oscillations. Currently, no available method can extract jumps and AM-FM oscillatory components directly from the data. In our novel approach, we design and solve a variational optimization problem to accomplish this task. The optimization formulation includes a regularization term to minimize the bandwidth of all signal modes for effective oscillation modeling, and a prior for extracting the jump component. Our method addresses the limitations of conventional AM-FM signal decomposition methods in extracting jumps, as well as the limitations of existing jump extraction methods in decomposing multiscale oscillations. By employing an optimization framework that accounts for both multiscale oscillatory components and discontinuities, our methods show superior performance compared to existing decomposition techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on synthetic, real-world, single-channel, and multivariate data, highlighting their utility in three specific applications: Earth's electric field signals, electrocardiograms (ECG), and electroencephalograms (EEG).",2024-07-10T16:17:27Z,2024-07-10T16:17:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07800v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07800v1,eess.SP
OFDM-Based Positioning with Unknown Data Payloads: Bounds and   Applications to LEO PNT,"Andrew M. Graff, Todd E.

In comparison to the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) derived in prior work, this ZZB captures the low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholding effects in TOA estimation and accounts for an unknown carrier phase. The derived ZZB is evaluated against CRBs and empirical TOA error variances. It is then evaluated on signals with resource allocations optimized for pilot-only TOA estimation, quantifying the performance gain over the best-case pilot-only signal designs.

To address this problem, we present a novel 2-bit programmable amplifying transmissive RIS with a power amplification function to enhance the transmission of electromagnetic signals. The transmissive function is achieved through a pair of radiation patches located on the upper and lower surfaces, respectively, while a microstrip line connects two patches. A power amplifier, SP4T switch, and directional coupler provide signal amplification and a 2-bit phase shift.

Unleashing Dynamic Range and Resolution in Unlimited Sensing Framework   via Novel Hardware,"Yuliang Zhu, Ayush Bhandari","Conventional digitization based on the Shannon-Nyquist method, implemented via analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), faces fundamental limitations. High-dynamic-range (HDR) signals often get clipped or saturated in practice. Given a fixed bit budget, one must choose between minimizing quantization noise or accommodating HDR inputs. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) eliminates saturation by incorporating nonlinear folding in analog hardware, resulting in modulo signals. Quantizing or digitizing modulo signals enables low quantization noise as the modulo representation maps HDR signals into low-dynamic-range (LDR) samples. In the context of USF, the core innovation of this paper is a novel, low-cost, integrator-based efficient modulo ADC hardware implementation that imposes no restrictions on folding rates, enabling significantly HDR capture. The feasibility of this design is demonstrated by hardware experiments showcasing clear advantages across different quantitative performance metrics.

Functions of Bifans in Context of Multiple Regulatory Motifs in   Signaling Networks,"Azi Lipshtat, Sudarshan P. Purushothaman, Ravi Iyengar, Avi Ma'ayan","Representation of intracellular signaling networks as directed graphs allows for the identification of regulatory motifs. Regulatory motifs are groups of nodes with the same connectivity structure, capable of processing information. The bifan motif, made of two source nodes directly cross-regulating two target nodes, is an over-represented motif in a mammalian cell signaling network and in transcriptional networks. One example of a bifan is the two MAP-kinases, p38 and JNK that phosphorylate and activate the two transcription factors ATF2 and Elk-1. We have used a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to analyze the regulatory capability of this bifan motif by itself, and when it interacts with other motifs such as positive and negative feedback loops. Our results indicate that bifans provide temporal regulation of signal propagation and act as signal sorters, filters, and synchronizers. Bifans that have OR gate configurations show rapid responses while AND gate bifans can introduce delays and allow prolongation of signal outputs. Bifans that are AND gates can filter noisy signal inputs. The p38/JNK-ATF2/Elk-1bifan synchronizes the output of activated transcription factors. Synchronization is a robust property of bifans and is exhibited even when the bifan is adjacent to a positive feedback loop. The presence of the bifan promotes the transcription and translation of the dual specificity protein phosphatase MKP-1 that inhibits p38 and JNK thus enabling a negative feedback loop. These results indicate that bifan motifs in cell signaling networks can contribute to signal processing capability both intrinsically and by enabling the functions of other regulatory motifs.",2007-11-30T14:15:37Z,2007-11-30T14:15:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4937v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.4937v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM, q-bio.SC"
Regulation of signal duration and the statistical dynamics of kinase   activation by scaffold proteins,"Jason W. Locasale, Arup K. Chakraborty","Scaffolding proteins that direct the assembly of multiple kinases into a spatially localized signaling complex are often essential for the maintenance of an appropriate biological response. Although scaffolds are widely believed to have dramatic effects on the dynamics of signal propagation, the mechanisms that underlie these consequences are not well understood. Here, Monte Carlo simulations of a model kinase cascade are used to investigate how the temporal characteristics of signaling cascades can be influenced by the presence of scaffold proteins. Specifically, we examine the effects of spatially localizing kinase components on a scaffold on signaling dynamics. The simulations indicate that a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is to control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time. Scaffolds can influence the timing of kinase activation by allowing for kinases to become activated over a broad range of times, thus allowing for signaling at both early and late times. Scaffold concentrations that result in optimal signal amplitude also result in the broadest distributions of times over which kinases are activated. These calculations provide insights into one mechanism that describes how the duration of a signal can potentially be regulated in a scaffold mediated protein kinase cascade. Our results illustrate another complexity in the broad array of control properties that emerge from the physical effects of spatially localizing components of kinase cascades on scaffold proteins.",2008-07-13T01:58:02Z,2008-10-29T03:06:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2008v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.2008v2,"q-bio.SC, q-bio.MN"
Mapping the intramolecular signal transduction of G-protein coupled   receptors,"Yoonji Lee, Sun Choi, Changbong Hyeon","G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a major gatekeeper of extracellular signals on plasma membrane, are unarguably one of the most important therapeutic targets. Given the recent discoveries of allosteric modulations, an allosteric wiring diagram of intramolecular signal transductions would be of great use to glean the mechanism of receptor regulation. Here, by evaluating betweenness centrality ($C_B$) of each residue, we calculate maps of information flow in GPCRs and identify key residues for signal transductions and their pathways. Compared with preexisting approaches, the allosteric hotspots that our $C_B$-based analysis detects for A$_{2A}$ adenosine receptor (A$_{2A}$AR) and bovine rhodopsin are better correlated with biochemical data. In particular, our analysis outperforms other methods in locating the rotameric microswitches, which are generally deemed critical for mediating orthosteric signaling in class A GPCRs. For A$_{2A}$AR, the inter-residue cross-correlation map, calculated using equilibrium structural ensemble from molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that strong signals of long-range transmembrane communications exist only in the agonist-bound state. A seemingly subtle variation in structure, found in different GPCR subtypes or imparted by agonist bindings or a point mutation at an allosteric site, can lead to a drastic difference in the map of signaling pathways and protein activity. The signaling map of GPCRs provides valuable insights into allosteric modulations as well as reliable identifications of orthosteric signaling pathways.",2013-10-15T14:00:12Z,2013-10-15T14:00:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4058v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4058v1,"q-bio.BM, q-bio.MN"
Accurate encoding and decoding by single cells: amplitude versus   frequency modulation,"Gabriele Micali, Gerardo Aquino, David M. Richards, Robert G. Endres","Cells sense external concentrations and, via biochemical signaling, respond by regulating the expression of target proteins. Both in signaling networks and gene regulation there are two main mechanisms by which the concentration can be encoded internally: amplitude modulation (AM), where the absolute concentration of an internal signaling molecule encodes the stimulus, and frequency modulation (FM), where the period between successive bursts represents the stimulus. Although both mechanisms have been observed in biological systems, the question of when it is beneficial for cells to use either AM or FM is largely unanswered. Here, we first consider a simple model for a single receptor (or ion channel), which can either signal continuously whenever a ligand is bound, or produce a burst in signaling molecule upon receptor binding. We find that bursty signaling is more accurate than continuous signaling only for sufficiently fast dynamics. This suggests that modulation based on bursts may be more common in signaling networks than in gene regulation. We then extend our model to multiple receptors, where continuous and bursty signaling are equivalent to AM and FM respectively, finding that AM is always more accurate. This implies that the reason some cells use FM is related to factors other than accuracy, such as the ability to coordinate expression of multiple genes or to implement threshold crossing mechanisms.",2015-05-20T15:09:49Z,2015-05-20T15:09:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05410v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05410v1,q-bio.SC

This report examines the performance of different estimators such as Least Square, Weighted Least Square, and Huber robustness in order to obtain the most robust performance.

Signal Shaping for Generalized Spatial Modulation and Generalized   Quadrature Spatial Modulation,"Shuaishuai Guo, Haixia Zhang, Peng Zhang, Shuping Dang, Liang Cong, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","This paper investigates generic signal shaping methods for multiple-data-stream generalized spatial modulation (GenSM) and generalized quadrature spatial modulation (GenQSM) based on the maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance (MMED) criterion. Three cases with different channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) are considered, including no CSIT, statistical CSIT and perfect CSIT. A unified optimization problem is formulated to find the optimal transmit vector set under size, power and sparsity constraints. We propose an optimization-based signal shaping (OBSS) approach by solving the formulated problem directly and a codebook-based signal shaping (CBSS) approach by finding sub-optimal solutions in discrete space. In the OBSS approach, we reformulate the original problem to optimize the signal constellations used for each transmit antenna combination (TAC). Both the size and entry of all signal constellations are optimized. Specifically, we suggest the use of a recursive design for size optimization. The entry optimization is formulated as a non-convex large-scale quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem and can be solved by existing optimization techniques with rather high complexity. To reduce the complexity, we propose the CBSS approach using a codebook generated by quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols and a low-complexity selection algorithm to choose the optimal transmit vector set. Simulation results show that the OBSS approach exhibits the optimal performance in comparison with existing benchmarks. However, the OBSS approach is impractical for large-size signal shaping and adaptive signal shaping with instantaneous CSIT due to the demand of high computational complexity. As a low-complexity approach, CBSS shows comparable performance and can be easily implemented in large-size systems.",2019-01-27T05:10:38Z,2019-01-27T05:10:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09318v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09318v1,eess.SP
An Example-Driven Introduction to Data Analytics on Graphs,"Ljubisa Stankovic, Danilo Mandic, Milos Dakovic, Ilya Kisil, Ervin Sejdic, Anthony G. Constantinides","Graphs are irregular structures which naturally account for data integrity, however, traditional approaches have been established outside Signal Processing, and largely focus on analyzing the underlying graphs rather than signals on graphs. Given the rapidly increasing availability of multisensor and multinode measurements, likely recorded on irregular or ad-hoc grids, it would be extremely advantageous to analyze such structured data as graph signals and thus benefit from the ability of graphs to incorporate spatial awareness of the sensing locations, sensor importance, and local versus global sensor association. The aim of this lecture note is therefore to establish a common language between graph signals, defined on irregular signal domains, and some of the most fundamental paradigms in DSP, such as spectral analysis of multichannel signals, system transfer function, digital filter design, parameter estimation, and optimal filter design. This is achieved through a physically meaningful and intuitive real-world example of geographically distributed multisensor temperature estimation. A similar spatial multisensor arrangement is already widely used in Signal Processing curricula to introduce minimum variance estimators and Kalman filters \cite{HM}, and by adopting this framework we facilitate a seamless integration of graph theory into the curriculum of existing DSP courses. By bridging the gap between standard approaches and graph signal processing, we also show that standard methods can be thought of as special cases of their graph counterparts, evaluated on linear graphs. It is hoped that our approach would not only help to demystify graph theoretic approaches in education and research but it would also empower practitioners to explore a whole host of otherwise prohibitive modern applications.",2019-03-26T22:19:25Z,2019-05-12T08:34:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11179v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.11179v2,eess.SP
Complementary Intermittently Nonlinear Filtering for Mitigation of   Hidden Outlier Interference,"Alexei V. Nikitin, Ruslan L. Davidchack","When interference affecting various communication and sensor systems contains clearly identifiable outliers (e.g. an impulsive component), it can be efficiently mitigated in real time by intermittently nonlinear filters developed in our earlier work, achieving improvements in the signal quality otherwise unattainable. However, apparent amplitude outliers in the interference can disappear and reappear due to various filtering effects, including fading and multipass, as the signal propagates through media and/or the signal processing chain. In addition, the outlier structure of the interference can be obscured by strong non-outlier interfering signals, such as thermal noise and/or adjacent channel interference, or by the signal of interest itself. In this paper, we first outline the overall approach to using intermittently nonlinear filters for in-band, real-time mitigation of such interference with hidden outlier components in practical complex interference scenarios. We then introduce Complementary Intermittently Nonlinear Filters (CINFs) and focus on the particular task of mitigating the outlier noise obscured by the signal of interest itself. We describe practical implementations of such nonlinear filtering arrangements for mitigation of hidden outlier interference, in the process of analog-to-digital conversion, for wide ranges of interference powers and the rates of outlier generating events. To emphasize the effectiveness and versatility of this approach, in our examples we use particularly challenging waveforms that severely obscure low-amplitude outlier noise, such as broadband chirp signals (e.g. used in radar, sonar, and spread-spectrum communications) and ``bursty,"" high crest factor signals (e.g. OFDM).",2019-06-03T12:23:41Z,2019-06-03T12:23:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01456v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01456v1,eess.SP
A-Optimal Sampling and Robust Reconstruction for Graph Signals via   Truncated Neumann Series,"Fen Wang, Yongchao Wang, Gene Cheung","Graph signal processing (GSP) studies signals that live on irregular data kernels described by graphs. One fundamental problem in GSP is sampling---from which subset of graph nodes to collect samples in order to reconstruct a bandlimited graph signal in high fidelity. In this paper, we seek a sampling strategy that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstructed bandlimited graph signals assuming an independent and identically distributed (iid) noise model---leading naturally to the A-optimal design criterion. To avoid matrix inversion, we first prove that the inverse of the information matrix in the A-optimal criterion is equivalent to a Neumann matrix series. We then transform the truncated Neumann series based sampling problem into an equivalent expression that replaces eigenvectors of the Laplacian operator with a sub-matrix of an ideal low-pass graph filter. Finally, we approximate the ideal filter using a Chebyshev matrix polynomial. We design a greedy algorithm to iteratively minimize the simplified objective. For signal reconstruction, we propose an accompanied signal reconstruction strategy that reuses the approximated filter sub-matrix and is provably more robust than conventional least square recovery. Simulation results show that our sampling strategy outperforms two previous strategies in MSE performance at comparable complexity.",2018-03-09T02:07:58Z,2018-12-04T15:52:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03353v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03353v2,eess.SP
Noisy One-bit Compressed Sensing with Side-Information,"Swatantra Kafle, Thakshila Wimalajeewa, and Pramod K. Varshney","We consider the problem of sparse signal reconstruction from noisy one-bit compressed measurements when the receiver has access to side-information (SI). We assume that compressed measurements are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise before quantization and sign-flip error after quantization. A generalized approximate message passing-based method for signal reconstruction from noisy one-bit compressed measurements is proposed, which is then extended for the case where the receiver has access to a signal that aids signal reconstruction, i.e., side-information. Two different scenarios of side-information are considered-a) side-information consisting of support information only, and b) side information consisting of support and amplitude information. SI is either a noisy version of the signal or a noisy estimate of the support of the signal. We develop reconstruction algorithms from one-bit measurements using noisy SI available at the receiver. Laplacian distribution and Bernoulli distribution are used to model the two types of noises which, when applied to the signal and the support, yields the SI for the above two cases, respectively. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the noise parameters using noisy one-bit compressed measurements and the SI. We show that one-bit compressed measurement-based signal reconstruction is quite sensitive to noise, and the reconstruction performance can be significantly improved by exploiting available side-information at the receiver.",2020-06-09T18:51:53Z,2020-06-09T18:51:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05454v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05454v1,eess.SP
Short-time Fourier transform based on stimulated Brillouin scattering,"Pengcheng Zuo, Dong Ma, Yang Chen","In this paper, all-optical short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is proposed and further used for real-time time-frequency analysis of different radio frequency (RF) signals. In the proposed all-optical STFT system, SBS not only provides a band-pass filter for implementing the window function in conjunction with a periodic frequency-sweep optical signal but also obtains the frequency domain information in different time windows through the generated waveform via frequency-to-time mapping (FTTM). A periodic frequency-sweep optical signal is generated and then modulated at a Mach-Zehnder modulator by the electrical signal under test (SUT). During different sweep periods, the fixed Brillouin gain functions as a bandpass filter to select a specific range of the spectrum, which is equivalent to applying a sliding window function to the corresponding section of the temporal signal with the help of the sweep optical signal. At the same time, after the optical signal is selectively amplified by the SBS gain and converted back to the electrical domain, SBS also implements the real-time FTTM, which can be utilized to obtain the frequency domain information corresponding to different time windows through the generated waveforms via the FTTM. The frequency domain information corresponding to different time windows is formed and spliced to analyze the time-frequency relationship of the SUT in real-time. An experiment is performed. STFTs of a variety of RF signals are carried out in a 12-GHz bandwidth limited only by the equipment, and the dynamic frequency resolution is better than 60 MHz.",2021-11-26T11:45:00Z,2021-11-26T11:45:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13438v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13438v1,eess.SP
RF-Based Low-SNR Classification of UAVs Using Convolutional Neural   Networks,"Ender Ozturk, Fatih Erden, Ismail Guvenc","This paper investigates the problem of classification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from radio frequency (RF) fingerprints at the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with both RF time-series images and the spectrograms of 15 different off-the-shelf drone controller RF signals. When using time-series signal images, the CNN extracts features from the signal transient and envelope. As the SNR decreases, this approach fails dramatically because the information in the transient is lost in the noise, and the envelope is distorted heavily. In contrast to time-series representation of the RF signals, with spectrograms, it is possible to focus only on the desired frequency interval, i.e., 2.4 GHz ISM band, and filter out any other signal component outside of this band. These advantages provide a notable performance improvement over the time-series signals-based methods. To further increase the classification accuracy of the spectrogram-based CNN, we denoise the spectrogram images by truncating them to a limited spectral density interval. Creating a single model using spectrogram images of noisy signals and tuning the CNN model parameters, we achieve a classification accuracy varying from 92% to 100% for an SNR range from -10 dB to 30 dB, which significantly outperforms the existing approaches to our best knowledge.",2020-09-11T16:42:38Z,2020-09-21T15:39:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05519v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05519v2,"eess.SP, eess.IV"
Empirical Fourier Decomposition: An Accurate Adaptive Signal   Decomposition Method,"Wei Zhou, Zhongren Feng, Y. F. Xu, Xiongjiang Wang, Hao Lv","Signal decomposition is an effective tool to assist the identification of modal information in time-domain signals. Two signal decomposition methods, including the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and Fourier decomposition method (FDM), have been developed based on Fourier theory. However, the EWT can suffer from a mode mixing problem for signals with closely-spaced modes and decomposition results by FDM can suffer from an inconsistency problem. An accurate adaptive signal decomposition method, called the empirical Fourier decomposition (EFD), is proposed to solve the problems in this work. The proposed EFD combines the uses of an improved Fourier spectrum segmentation technique and an ideal filter bank. The segmentation technique can solve the inconsistency problem by predefining the number of modes in a signal to be decomposed and filter functions in the ideal filter bank have no transition phases, which can solve the mode mixing problem. Numerical investigations are conducted to study the accuracy of the EFD. It is shown that the EFD can yield accurate and consistent decomposition results for signals with multiple non-stationary modes and those with closely-spaced modes, compared with decomposition results by the EWT, FDM, variational mode decomposition and empirical mode decomposition. It is also shown that the EFD can yield accurate time-frequency representation results and it has the highest computational efficiency among the compared methods.",2020-09-17T03:56:48Z,2020-10-08T02:15:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08047v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08047v2,eess.SP
Feasibility Study on Intra-Grid Location Estimation Using Power ENF   Signals,"Ravi Garg, Adi Hajj-Ahmad, Min Wu","The Electric Network Frequency (ENF) is a signature of power distribution networks that can be captured by multimedia recordings made in areas where there is electrical activity. This has led to an emergence of several forensic applications based on the use of the ENF signature. Examples of such applications include estimating or verifying the time-of-recording of a media signal and inferring the power grid associated with the location in which the media signal was recorded. In this paper, we carry out a feasibility study to examine the possibility of using embedded ENF traces to pinpoint the location-of-recording of a signal within a power grid. In this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the location-of-recording to a certain geographical resolution using power signal recordings containing strong ENF traces. To this purpose, a high-passed version of an ENF signal is extracted and it is demonstrated that the correlation between two such signals, extracted from recordings made in different geographical locations within the same grid, decreases as the distance between the recording locations increases. We harness this property of correlation in the ENF signals to propose trilateration based localization methods, which pinpoint the unknown location of a recording while using some known recording locations as anchor locations. We also discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in order to extend this work to using ENF traces in noisier audio/video recordings for such fine localization purposes.",2021-05-03T07:56:54Z,2021-05-03T07:56:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00668v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00668v1,"eess.SP, eess.IV"
Hierarchical Learning Framework for UAV Detection and Identification,"Olusiji O Medaiyese, Martins Ezuma, Adrian P Lauf, Ayodeji A Adeniran","The ubiquity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones is posing both security and safety risks to the public as UAVs are now used for cybercrimes. To mitigate these risks, it is important to have a system that can detect or identify the presence of an intruding UAV in a restricted environment. In this work, we propose a radio frequency (RF) based UAV detection and identification system by exploiting signals emanating from both the UAV and its flight controller, respectively. While several RF devices (i.e., Bluetooth and WiFi devices) operate in the same frequency band as UAVs, the proposed framework utilizes a semi-supervised learning approach for the detection of UAV or UAV's control signals in the presence of other wireless signals such as Bluetooth and WiFi. The semi-supervised learning approach uses stacked denoising autoencoder and local outlier factor algorithms. After the detection of UAV or UAV's control signals, the signal is decomposed by using Hilbert-Huang transform and wavelet packet transform to extract features from the time-frequency-energy domain of the signal. The extracted feature sets are used to train a three-level hierarchical classifier for identifying the type of signals (i.e., UAV or UAV control signal), UAV models, and flight mode of UAV. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we carried out an outdoor experiment for data collection using six UAVs, five Bluetooth devices, and two WiFi devices. The acquired data is called Cardinal RF (CardRF) dataset, and it is available for public use to foster UAV detection and identification research.",2021-07-10T20:51:55Z,2021-07-10T20:51:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04908v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04908v1,eess.SP

The accurate extraction of semantic signals using the aforementioned ML and AI methods, and the detection of semantic innovation for scheduling transmission and/or storage events are critical tasks for reliable semantic signal processing and communications. In this work, we propose a reliable semantic information extraction framework based on our previous work on semantic signal representations in a hierarchical graph-based structure. The proposed framework includes a time integration method to increase fidelity of ML outputs in a class-aware manner, a graph-edit-distance based metric to detect innovation events at the graph-level and filter out sporadic errors, and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to produce smooth and reliable graph signals.

The excitatory glutamatergic signals from the hippocampus (HIP) to the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate learned behavior in addiction. Limited comparative studies have investigated the neural pathways activated by natural and unnatural reward sources. This study has evaluated neural activities in HIP and NAc associated with food (natural) and morphine (drug) reward sources using local field potential (LFP). We developed novel approaches to classify LFP signals into the source of reward and recorded regions by considering the time-domain feature of these signals. Proposed methods included a validation step of the LFP signals using autocorrelation, Lyapunov exponent and Hurst exponent to assess the meaningful stability of these signals (lack of chaos). By utilizing the probability density function (PDF) of LFP signals and applying Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), data were classified to the source of the reward. Also, HIP and NAc regions were visually separated and classified using the symmetrized dot pattern technique, which can be applied in real-time to ensure the deep brain region of interest is being targeted accurately during LFP recording.

Schr√∂dinger Spectrum based Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure   Estimation using Clinically Relevant Features from PPG Signal and its Second   Derivative,"Aayushman Ghosh, Sayan Sarkar, Jayant Kalra","The presented study aims to estimate blood pressure (BP) using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals while employing multiple machine learning models. The study proposes a novel algorithm for signal reconstruction, which utilizes the semi-classical signal analysis (SCSA) technique. The proposed algorithm optimises the semi-classical constant and eliminates the trade-off between complexity and accuracy in reconstruction. The reconstructed signals' spectral features are extracted and incorporated with clinically relevant PPG and its second derivative's (SDPPG) morphological features. The developed method was assessed using a publicly available virtual in-silico dataset with more than 4000 subjects, and the Multi-Parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Units dataset. Results showed that the method attained a mean absolute error of 5.37 and 2.96 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, using the CatBoost supervisory algorithm. This approach met the standards set by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, and achieved Grade A for all BP categories in the British Hypertension Society protocol. The proposed framework performs well even when applied to a combined database of the MIMIC-III and the Queensland dataset. This study also evaluates the proposed method's performance in a non-clinical setting with noisy and deformed PPG signals, to validate the efficacy of the SCSA method. The noise stress tests showed that the algorithm maintained its key feature detection, signal reconstruction capability, and estimation accuracy up to a 10 dB SNR ratio. It is believed that the proposed cuff-less BP estimation technique has the potential to perform well on resource-constrained settings due to its straightforward implementation approach.",2023-01-20T06:34:54Z,2023-01-20T06:34:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08439v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08439v1,eess.SP
Neuromorphic Sampling of Signals in Shift-Invariant Spaces,"Abijith Jagannath Kamath, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula","Neuromorphic sampling is a paradigm shift in analog-to-digital conversion where the acquisition strategy is opportunistic and measurements are recorded only when there is a significant change in the signal. Neuromorphic sampling has given rise to a new class of event-based sensors called dynamic vision sensors or neuromorphic cameras. The neuromorphic sampling mechanism utilizes low power and provides high-dynamic range sensing with low latency and high temporal resolution. The measurements are sparse and have low redundancy making it convenient for downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a sampling-theoretic perspective to neuromorphic sensing of continuous-time signals. We establish a close connection between neuromorphic sampling and time-based sampling - where signals are encoded temporally. We analyse neuromorphic sampling of signals in shift-invariant spaces, in particular, bandlimited signals and polynomial splines. We present an iterative technique for perfect reconstruction subject to the events satisfying a density criterion. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect reconstruction. Owing to practical limitations in meeting the sufficient conditions for perfect reconstruction, we extend the analysis to approximate reconstruction from sparse events. In the latter setting, we pose signal reconstruction as a continuous-domain linear inverse problem whose solution can be obtained by solving an equivalent finite-dimensional convex optimization program using a variable-splitting approach. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and validate our claims via experiments on synthetic signals.",2023-06-08T11:07:26Z,2023-06-08T11:07:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05103v1,eess.SP
An Improved Compound Gaussian Model for Bivariate Surface EMG Signals   Related to Strength Training,"Durgesh Kusuru, Anish C. Turlapaty, Mainak Thakur","Recent literature suggests that the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals have non-stationary statistical characteristics specifically due to random nature of the covariance. Thus suitability of a statistical model for sEMG signals is determined by the choice of an appropriate model for describing the covariance. The purpose of this study is to propose a Compound-Gaussian (CG) model for multivariate sEMG signals in which latent variable of covariance is modeled as a random variable that follows an exponential model. The parameters of the model are estimated using the iterative Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Further, a new dataset, electromyography analysis of human activities database 2 (EMAHA-DB2) is developed. Based on the model fitting analysis on the sEMG signals from EMAHA-DB2, it is found that the proposed CG model fits more closely to the empirical pdf of sEMG signals than the existing models. The proposed model is validated by visual inspection, further validated by matching central moments and better quantitative metrics in comparison with other models. The proposed compound model provides an improved fit to the statistical behavior of sEMG signals. Further, the estimate of rate parameter of the exponential model shows clear relation to the training weights. Finally, the average signal power estimates of the channels shows distinctive dependency on the training weights, the subject's training experience and the type of activity.",2023-07-07T06:00:55Z,2023-07-07T06:00:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03403v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03403v1,eess.SP
Diagnosing epilepsy using entropy measures and embedding parameters of   EEG signals,"Fatemeh Valipour, Zahra Valipour, Mani Garousi, Ali Khadem","Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects normal neural activity. These electrical activities can be recorded as signals containing information about the brain known as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Analysis of the EEG signals by individuals for epilepsy diagnosis is subjective and time-consuming. So, an automatic classification system with high detection accuracy is required to overcome possible errors. In this study, the discrete wavelet transform has been applied to EEG signals. Then, entropy measures and embedding parameters have been extracted. These features have been investigated individually to find the most discriminating ones. The significance level of each feature was evaluated by statistical analysis. Consequently, LDA and SVM algorithms have been employed to categorize the EEG signals. The results have indicated that the features of Embedding parameters, PermutationEntropy, FuzzyEntropy, SampleEntropy, NormEntropy, SureEntropy, LogEntropy, and ThresholdEntropy have the potential to discriminate epileptic patients from healthy subjects significantly. Also, SVM classifier has achieved the highest classification accuracy. In this study, we could find effective embedding-based and entropy-based features as appropriate single measures for identifying abnormal activities that can efficiently discriminate the EEG signals of epileptics from healthy individuals.

Joint Sequential Fronthaul Quantization and Hardware Complexity   Reduction in Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks,"Vida Ranjbar, Robbert Beerten, Marc Moonen, Sofie Pollin","Fronthaul quantization causes a significant distortion in cell-free massive MIMO networks. Due to the limited capacity of fronthaul links, information exchange among access points (APs) must be quantized significantly. Furthermore, the complexity of the multiplication operation in the base-band processing unit increases with the number of bits of the operands. Thus, quantizing the APs' signal vector reduces the complexity of signal estimation in the base-band processing unit. Most recent works consider the direct quantization of the received signal vectors at each AP without any pre-processing. However, the signal vectors received at different APs are correlated mutually (inter-AP correlation) and also have correlated dimensions (intra-AP correlation). Hence, cooperative quantization of APs fronthaul can help to efficiently use the quantization bits at each AP and further reduce the distortion imposed on the quantized vector at the APs. This paper considers a daisy chain fronthaul and three different processing sequences at each AP. We show that 1) de-correlating the received signal vector at each AP from the corresponding vectors of the previous APs (inter-AP de-correlation) and 2) de-correlating the dimensions of the received signal vector at each AP (intra-AP de-correlation) before quantization helps to use the quantization bits at each AP more efficiently than directly quantizing the received signal vector without any pre-processing and consequently, improves the bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of users signal estimation.",2024-05-02T14:11:23Z,2024-05-02T14:11:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01303v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01303v1,eess.SP
ECG-TEM: Time-based sub-Nyquist sampling for ECG signal reconstruction   and Hardware Prototype,"Hila Naaman, Daniel Bilik, Shlomi Savariego, Moshe Namer, Yonina C. Eldar","Portable heart rate monitoring (HRM) systems based on electrocardiograms (ECGs) have become increasingly crucial for preventing lifestyle diseases. For such portable systems, minimizing power consumption and sampling rate is critical due to the substantial data generated during long-term ECG monitoring. The variable pulse-width finite rate of innovation (VPW-FRI) framework provides an effective solution for low-rate sampling and compression of ECG signals. We develop a time-based sub-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction method for ECG signals specifically designed for HRM applications. Our approach harnesses the integrate-and-fire time-encoding machine (IF-TEM) as a power-efficient, time-based, asynchronous sampler, generating a sequence of time instants without the need for a global clock. The ECG signal is represented as a linear combination of VPW-FRI pulses, which is then subjected to pre-filtering before being sampled by the IF-TEM sampler. A compactly supported robust filter with a frequency-domain alias cancellation condition is used to combat the effects of noise. Our reconstruction process involves consecutive partial summations of discrete representations of the input signal derived from the series of time encodings, further enhancing the accuracy of the reconstructed ECG signals. Additionally, we introduce an IF-TEM sampling hardware system for ECG signals, implemented using an analog filter device. The firing rate is 42-80Hz, equivalent to approximately 0.025-0.05 of the Nyquist rate. Our hardware validation bridges the gap between theory and practice and demonstrates the robust performance and practical applicability of our approach in accurately monitoring heart rates and reconstructing ECG signals.",2024-05-22T18:24:46Z,2024-05-22T18:24:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13904v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13904v1,eess.SP
Extraction of In-Phase and Quadrature Components by Time-Encoding   Sampling,"Y. H. Shao, S. Y. Chen, H. Z. Yang, F. Xi, H. Hong, Z.

We propose an integrate-and-fire TEM scheme by which the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components are extracted through reconstruction. We design the TEM according to the signal bandwidth and amplitude instead of upper-edge frequency and amplitude as in the case of bandlimited/lowpass signals. We show that the I and Q components can be perfectly reconstructed from the TEM measurements if the minimum firing rate is equal to the Landau's rate of the signal. For the reconstruction of I and Q components, we develop an alternating projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm in which two POCS algorithms are alternately iterated. For the algorithm analysis, we define a solution space of vector-valued signals and prove that the proposed reconstruction algorithm converges to the correct unique solution in the noiseless case. The proposed TEM can operate regardless of the center frequencies of the bandpass signals. This is quite different from traditional bandpass sampling, where the center frequency should be carefully allocated for Landau's rate and its variations have the negative effect on the sampling performance. In addition, the proposed TEM achieves certain reconstructed signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratios for small firing rates in thermal noise, which is unavoidably present and will be aliased to the Nyquist band in the traditional sampling such that high sampling rates are required. We demonstrate the reconstruction performance and substantiate our claims via simulation experiments.",2024-05-27T07:11:41Z,2024-05-27T07:11:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16889v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16889v1,eess.SP
Signal Processing over Time-Varying Graphs: A Systematic Review,"Yi Yan, Jiacheng Hou, Zhenjie Song, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu","As irregularly structured data representations, graphs have received a large amount of attention in recent years and have been widely applied to various real-world scenarios such as social, traffic, and energy settings. Compared to non-graph algorithms, numerous graph-based methodologies benefited from the strong power of graphs for representing high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. In the field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP), analogies of classical signal processing concepts, such as shifting, convolution, filtering, and transformations are developed. However, many GSP techniques usually postulate the graph is static in both signal and typology. This assumption hinders the effectiveness of GSP methodologies as the assumption ignores the time-varying properties in numerous real-world systems. For example, in the traffic network, the signal on each node varies over time and contains underlying temporal correlation and patterns worthy of analysis. To tackle this challenge, more and more work are being done recently to investigate the processing of time-varying graph signals. They cope with time-varying challenges from three main directions: 1) graph time-spectral filtering, 2) multi-variate time-series forecasting, and 3) spatiotemporal graph data mining by neural networks, where non-negligible progress has been achieved. Despite the success of signal processing and learning over time-varying graphs, there is no survey to compare and conclude the current methodology for GSP and graph learning. To compensate for this, in this paper, we aim to review the development and recent progress on signal processing and learning over time-varying graphs, and compare their advantages and disadvantages from both the methodological and experimental side, to outline the challenges and potential research directions for future research.",2024-11-30T12:44:27Z,2024-11-30T12:44:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00462v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00462v1,eess.SP
Infinite Factorial Linear Dynamical Systems for Transient Signal   Detection,"Jiadi Bao, Yatong Wang, Yunjie Li, Mengtao Zhu, Shafei Wang","Accurately detecting the transient signal of interest from the background signal is one of the fundamental tasks in signal processing. The most recent approaches assume the existence of a single background source and represent the background signal using a linear dynamical system (LDS). This assumption might fail to capture the complexities of modern electromagnetic environments with multiple sources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method for detecting the transient signal in a background composed of an unknown number of emitters. The proposed method consists of two main tasks. First, a Bayesian nonparametric model called the infinite factorial linear dynamical system (IFLDS) is developed. The developed model is based on the sticky Indian buffet process and enables the representation and parameter learning of the unbounded number of background sources. This study also designs a parameter learning method for the IFLDS using slice sampling and particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling. Second, the finite moving average (FMA) stopping time is introduced to minimize the worst-case probability of missed detection, and the statistical performance of the stopping time is investigated. To facilitate the computation of the FMA stopping time, this study derives the factorial Kalman forward filtering (FKFF) method and designs a dependence structure for the underlying model, allowing the stopping time to be defined by a recursive function. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the validity of the theoretical results. The experimental results of the pulse signal detection under the condition of communication interference confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",2025-01-09T05:05:31Z,2025-01-09T05:05:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04973v1,eess.SP
BMAR: Barometric and Motion-based Alignment and Refinement for Offline   Signal Synchronization across Devices,"Manuel Meier, Christian Holz","A requirement of cross-modal signal processing is accurate signal alignment. Though simple on a single device, accurate signal synchronization becomes challenging as soon as multiple devices are involved, such as during activity monitoring, health tracking, or motion capture - particularly outside controlled scenarios where data collection must be standalone, low-power, and support long runtimes. In this paper, we present BMAR, a novel synchronization method that operates purely based on recorded signals and is thus suitable for offline processing. BMAR needs no wireless communication between devices during runtime and does not require any specific user input, action, or behavior. BMAR operates on the data from devices worn by the same person that record barometric pressure and acceleration - inexpensive, low-power, and thus commonly included sensors in today's wearable devices. In its first stage, BMAR verifies that two recordings were acquired simultaneously and pre-aligns all data traces. In a second stage, BMAR refines the alignment using acceleration measurements while accounting for clock skew between devices. In our evaluation, three to five body-worn devices recorded signals from the wearer for up to ten hours during a series of activities. BMAR synchronized all signal recordings with a median error of 33.4 ms and reliably rejected non-overlapping signal traces. The worst-case activity was sleeping, where BMAR's second stage could not exploit motion for refinement and, thus, aligned traces with a median error of 3.06 s.",2025-01-27T12:58:07Z,2025-01-27T12:58:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16015v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16015v1,eess.SP

Neuronal coupling benefits the encoding of weak periodic signals in   symbolic spike patterns,"Maria Masoliver, Cristina Masoller","A good understanding of how neurons use electrical pulses (i.e, spikes) to encode the signal information remains elusive. Analyzing spike sequences generated by individual neurons and by two coupled neurons (using the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model), recent theoretical studies have found that the relative timing of the spikes can encode the signal information. Using a symbolic method to analyze the spike sequence, preferred and infrequent spike patterns were detected, whose probabilities vary with both, the amplitude and the frequency of the signal. To investigate if this encoding mechanism is plausible also for neuronal ensembles, here we analyze the activity of a group of neurons, when they all perceive a weak periodic signal. We find that, as in the case of one or two coupled neurons, the probabilities of the spike patterns, now computed from the spike sequences of all the neurons, depend on the signal's amplitude and period, and thus, the patterns' probabilities encode the information of the signal. We also find that the resonances with the period of the signal or with the noise level are more pronounced when a group of neurons perceive the signal, in comparison with when only one or two coupled neurons perceive it. Neuronal coupling is beneficial for signal encoding as a group of neurons is able to encode a small-amplitude signal, which could not be encoded when it is perceived by just one or two coupled neurons. Interestingly, we find that for a group of neurons, just a few connections with one another can significantly improve the encoding of small-amplitude signals. Our findings indicate that information encoding in preferred and infrequent spike patterns is a plausible mechanism that can be employed by neuronal populations to encode weak periodic inputs, exploiting the presence of neural noise.",2019-05-06T11:25:24Z,2019-05-06T11:25:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01933v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01933v1,q-bio.NC

We give conditions under which this reconstruction procedure is stable and show that the least-squares estimates in each interval converge exponentially, meaning that the updates can be performed with finite memory with almost no loss in accuracy.

The plasticity of TGF-beta signaling,"Geraldine Celliere, Georgios Fengos, Marianne Herve, Dagmar Iber","The family of TGFb ligands is large and its members are involved in many different signaling processes. These signaling processes strongly differ in type with TGFb ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members of the TGFb family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then be expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand concentration. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications that are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGFb signaling network. To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the core of the TGFb signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we identified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give rise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as well as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to time-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens). A combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus biases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while oscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the turn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient receptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding. We find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the response type. The architecture of the TGFb pathway enables the observed signaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGFb ligand in different cell types and under different conditions can be explained with differences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective rate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways.",2011-11-01T13:34:54Z,2011-11-02T14:54:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0201v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0201v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.SC"
Repurposing drugs for COVID-19 based on transcriptional response of host   cells to SARS-CoV-2,"Fuhai Li, Andrew P. Michelson, Randi Foraker, Ming Zhan, Philip R. O. Payne","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over 10 million people globally with a relatively high mortality rate. There are many therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling of host cells plays critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, and drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially effective for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify these potential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing drugs as a potentially effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeutic discovery, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. We first identified dysfunctional signaling pathways associated with the infection caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis of the altered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathway analysis, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies were identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly identified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and reverse gene expression data resources. The dexamethasone was top-ranked in the prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support.

The Effect of Signaling Latencies and Node Refractory States on the   Dynamics of Networks,Gabriel A. Silva,"We describe the construction and theoretical analysis of a framework derived from canonical neurophysiological principles that model the competing dynamics of incident signals into nodes along directed edges in a network. The framework describes the dynamics between the offset in the latencies of propagating signals, which reflect the geometry of the edges and conduction velocities, and the internal refractory dynamics and processing times of the downstream node receiving the signals. This framework naturally extends to the construction of a perceptron model that takes into account such dynamic geometric considerations. We first describe the model in detail, culminating with the model of a geometric dynamic perceptron. We then derive upper and lower bounds for a notion of optimal efficient signaling between vertex pairs based on the structure of the framework. Efficient signaling in the context of the framework we develop here means that there needs to be a temporal match between the arrival time of the signals relative to how quickly nodes can internally process signals. These bounds reflect numerical constraints on the compensation of the timing of signaling events of upstream nodes attempting to activate downstream nodes they connect into that preserve this notion of efficiency. When a mismatch between signal arrival times and the internal states of activated nodes occurs, it can cause a break down in the signaling dynamics of the network. In contrast to essentially all the current state of the art in machine learning, this work provides a theoretical foundation for machine learning and intelligence architectures based on the timing of node activations and their abilities to respond, rather than necessary changes in synaptic weights. At the same time, this work is guiding the discovery of experimentally testable new structure-function principles in the biological brain.",2018-04-17T22:31:29Z,2019-08-04T17:23:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07609v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07609v3,q-bio.NC
A time-causal and time-recursive scale-covariant scale-space   representation of temporal signals and past time,Tony Lindeberg,"This article presents an overview of a theory for performing temporal smoothing on temporal signals in such a way that: (i) temporally smoothed signals at coarser temporal scales are guaranteed to constitute simplifications of corresponding temporally smoothed signals at any finer temporal scale (including the original signal) and (ii) the temporal smoothing process is both time-causal and time-recursive, in the sense that it does not require access to future information and can be performed with no other temporal memory buffer of the past than the resulting smoothed temporal scale-space representations themselves.   For specific subsets of parameter settings for the classes of linear and shift-invariant temporal smoothing operators that obey this property, it is shown how temporal scale covariance can be additionally obtained, guaranteeing that if the temporal input signal is rescaled by a uniform scaling factor, then also the resulting temporal scale-space representations of the rescaled temporal signal will constitute mere rescalings of the temporal scale-space representations of the original input signal, complemented by a shift along the temporal scale dimension. The resulting time-causal limit kernel that obeys this property constitutes a canonical temporal kernel for processing temporal signal in real-time scenarios when the regular Gaussian kernel cannot be used because of its non-causal access to information from the future and we cannot additionally require the temporal smoothing process to comprise a complementary memory of the past beyond the information contained in the temporal smoothing process itself, which in this way also serves as a multi-scale temporal memory of the past.   This theory is generally applicable for both: (i) modelling continuous temporal phenomena over multiple temporal scales and (ii) digital processing of measured temporal signals in real time.",2022-02-18T14:15:11Z,2023-01-24T09:35:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09209v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09209v4,"q-bio.NC, eess.SP"
Joint Detection and Classification of Communication and Radar Signals in   Congested RF Environments Using YOLOv8,"Xiwen Kang, Hua-mei Chen, Genshe Chen, Kuo-Chu Chang, Thomas M. Clemons","In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the application of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art computer vision (CV) model, to the challenging problem of joint detection and classification of signals in a highly dynamic and congested RF environment. Using our synthetic RF datasets, we explored three different scenarios with congested communication and radar signals. In the first study, we applied YOLOv8 to detect and classify multiple digital modulation signals coexisting within a highly congested and dynamic spectral environment with significant overlap in both frequency and time domains. The trained model was able to achieve an impressive mean average precision (mAP) of 0.888 at an IoU threshold of 50%, signifying its robustness against spectral congestion. The second part of our research focuses on the detection and classification of multiple polyphase pulse radar signals, including Frank code and P1 through P4 codes. We were able to successfully train YOLOv8 to deliver a nearly perfect mAP50 score of 0.995 in a densely populated signal environment, further showcasing its capability in radar signal processing. In the last scenario, we demonstrated that the model can also be applied to the multi-target detection problem for continuous-wave radar. The synthetic datasets used in these experiments reflect a realistic mix of communication and radar signals with varying degrees of interference and congestion - a setup that has been overlooked by many past research efforts, which have primarily focused on ML-based classification of digital communication signal modulation schemes. Our study demonstrated the potential of advanced CV models in addressing spectrum sensing challenges in congested and dynamic RF environments involving both communication and radar signals.

The interplay between discrete noise and nonlinear chemical kinetics in   a signal amplification cascade,"Yueheng Lan, Garegin A. Papoian","We used various analytical and numerical techniques to elucidate signal propagation in a small enzymatic cascade which is subjected to external and internal noise. The nonlinear character of catalytic reactions, which underlie protein signal transduction cascades, renders stochastic signaling dynamics in cytosol biochemical networks distinct from the usual description of stochastic dynamics in gene regulatory networks. For a simple 2-step enzymatic cascade which underlies many important protein signaling pathways, we demonstrated that the commonly used techniques such as the linear noise approximation and the Langevin equation become inadequate when the number of proteins becomes too low. Consequently, we developed a new analytical approximation, based on mixing the generating function and distribution function approaches, to the solution of the master equation that describes nonlinear chemical signaling kinetics for this important class of biochemical reactions. Our techniques work in a much wider range of protein number fluctuations than the methods used previously. We found that under certain conditions the burst-phase noise may be injected into the downstream signaling network dynamics, resulting possibly in unusually large macroscopic fluctuations. In addition to computing first and second moments, which is the goal of commonly used analytical techniques, our new approach provides the full time-dependent probability distributions of the colored non-Gaussian processes in a nonlinear signal transduction cascade.",2006-07-19T06:41:28Z,2006-07-19T06:41:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0607028v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0607028v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM"

Signal transduction and directional sensing in eukaryotes,"Varunyu Khamviwath, Hans G. Othmer","Control of the cytoskeleton and mechanical contacts with the extracellular environment are essential component of motility in eukaryotic cells. In the absence of signals, cells continuously rebuild the cytoskeleton and periodically extend pseudopods or other protrusions at random membrane locations. Extracellular signals bias the direction of movement by biasing the extension of protrusions, but this involves another layer of biochemical networks for signal detection, transduction, and control of the rebuilding of the cytoskeleton. Here we develop a model for the latter processes that centers on a Ras-based module that adapts to constant extracellular signals and controls the downstream PI3K-PIP3-based module responsible for amplifying a spatial gradient of the signal. The resulting spatial gradient can lead to polarization, which enables cells to move in the preferred direction (up gradient for attractants and down-gradient for repellents). We show that the model can replicate many of the observed characteristics of the responses to cAMP stimulation for Dictyostelium, and analyze how cell geometry and signaling interact to produce the observed localization of some of the key components of the amplification module. We show how polarization can emerge without directional cues, and how it interacts with directional signals and leads to directional persistence. Since other cells such as neutrophils use similar pathways, the model is a generic one for a large class of eukaryotic cells.",2013-09-25T23:30:50Z,2013-09-25T23:30:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6692v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6692v1,q-bio.CB

Target Localization with Jammer Removal Using Frequency Diverse Array,"Qi Liu, Jingwei Xu, Zhi Ding, Hing Cheung So","A foremost task in frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar is to efficiently obtain the target signal in the presence of interferences. In this paper, we employ a novel ""low-rank + low-rank + sparse"" decomposition model to extract the low-rank desired signal and suppress the jamming signals from both barrage and burst jammers. In the literature, the barrage jamming signals, which are intentionally interfered by enemy jammer radar, are usually assumed Gaussian distributed. However, such assumption is oversimplified to hold in practice as the interferences often exhibit non-Gaussian properties. Those non-Gaussian jamming signals, known as impulsive noise or burst jamming, are involuntarily deviated from friendly radar or other working radio equipment including amplifier saturation and sensor failures, thunderstorms and man-made noise. The estimation performance of the existing estimators, relied crucially on the Gaussian noise assumption, may degrade substantially since the probability density function (PDF) of burst jamming has heavier tails that exceed a few standard deviations than the Gaussian distribution. To capture a more general signal model with burst jamming in practice, both barrage jamming and burst jamming are included and a two-step ""Go Decomposition"" (GoDec) method via alternating minimization is devised for such mixed jamming signal model, where the $a$ $priori$ rank information is exploited to suppress two kinds of jammers and estimate the desired target. Simulation results verify the robust performance of the devised scheme.",2019-12-29T02:01:33Z,2019-12-29T02:01:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12564v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12564v1,eess.SP

Such a joint radar-communications (JRC) model has advantages of low-cost, compact size, less power consumption, spectrum sharing, improved performance, and safety due to enhanced information sharing. Today, millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications have emerged as the preferred technology for short distance wireless links because they provide transmission bandwidth that is several gigahertz wide. This band is also promising for short-range radar applications, which benefit from the high-range resolution arising from large transmit signal bandwidths. Signal processing techniques are critical in implementation of mmWave JRC systems. Major challenges are joint waveform design and performance criteria that would optimally trade-off between communications and radar functionalities. Novel multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) signal processing techniques are required because mmWave JRC systems employ large antenna arrays. There are opportunities to exploit recent advances in cognition, compressed sensing, and machine learning to reduce required resources and dynamically allocate them with low overheads.

The Impact of Transceiver Noise on Digital Nonlinearity Compensation,"Daniel Semrau, Domanic Lavery, Lidia Galdino, Robert I. Killey, Polina Bayvel","The efficiency of digital nonlinearity compensation (NLC) is analyzed in the presence of noise arising from amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE) as well as from a non-ideal transceiver subsystem. Its impact on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reach increase is studied with particular emphasis on split NLC, where the digital back-propagation algorithm is divided between transmitter and receiver. An analytical model is presented to compute the SNR's for non-ideal transmission systems with arbitrary split NLC configurations. When signal-signal nonlinearities are compensated, the performance limitation arises from residual signal-noise interactions. These interactions consist of nonlinear beating between the signal and co-propagating ASE and transceiver noise. While transceiver noise-signal beating is usually dominant for short transmission distances, ASE noise-signal beating is dominant for larger transmission distances. It is shown that both regimes behave differently with respect to the optimal NLC split ratio and their respective reach gains. Additionally, simple formulas for the prediction of the optimal NLC split ratio and the reach increase in those two regimes are reported. It is found that split NLC offers negligible gain with respect to conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) for distances less than 1000 km using standard single-mode fibers and a transceiver (back-to-back) SNR of 26 dB, when transmitter and receiver inject the same amount of noise. However, when transmitter and receiver inject an unequal amount of noise, reach gains of 56% on top of DBP are achievable by properly tailoring the split NLC algorithm. The theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations.",2017-09-13T06:05:43Z,2017-09-13T06:05:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00782v1,eess.SP

Design of Automated Dual Band 4G Jammer using MATLAB Simulink,"Tutika Chetan Sai, G. Dinesh Kumar, V. Charan, S.

The MATLAB Simulink tool was used for the analysis of the circuit design. Simulink, an advanced tool gives accurate results comparable to real-time analysis. The DSP toolbox of the Simulink library has been largely used to construct and view the results of the model. The main objective of this paper is to receive the LTE signals, filter band 3 and band 40, add noise and increase the amplitude of the signal. The uniqueness of this design is the use of full wave rectifier in the circuit and the trigger enabled blocks. Full wave rectifier with added circuitry acts as a trigger to the jammer which contains the noise block and the gain block. Sine wave generators were used to replicate real-time signals and additional signals were added as noise. The advantage of the design is when none of the bands are detected, the output will not be generated, thus saving power. The incorporation of the detector circuit and trigger circuit ensures that power is not wasted by the jamming circuit when the signal is not detected. These jammers can be used in examination halls, conference halls and in secure location where telecommunication signals are unwanted.",2018-03-03T15:19:47Z,2018-03-03T15:19:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01183v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01183v1,eess.SP

Non-Bayesian Estimation Framework for Signal Recovery on Graphs,Tirza Routtenberg,"Graph signals arise from physical networks, such as power and communication systems, or as a result of a convenient representation of data with complex structure, such as social networks. We consider the problem of general graph signal recovery from noisy, corrupted, or incomplete measurements and under structural parametric constraints, such as smoothness in the graph frequency domain. In this paper, we formulate the graph signal recovery as a non-Bayesian estimation problem under a weighted mean-squared-error (WMSE) criterion, which is based on a quadratic form of the Laplacian matrix of the graph and its trace WMSE is the Dirichlet energy of the estimation error w.r.t. the graph. The Laplacian-based WMSE penalizes estimation errors according to their graph spectral content and is a difference-based cost function which accounts for the fact that in many cases signal recovery on graphs can only be achieved up to a constant addend. We develop a new Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) on the Laplacian-based WMSE and present the associated Lehmann unbiasedness condition w.r.t. the graph. We discuss the graph CRB and estimation methods for the fundamental problems of 1) A linear Gaussian model with relative measurements; and 2) Bandlimited graph signal recovery. We develop sampling allocation policies that optimize sensor locations in a network for these problems based on the proposed graph CRB. Numerical simulations on random graphs and on electrical network data are used to validate the performance of the graph CRB and sampling policies.",2020-05-05T05:44:42Z,2021-01-24T05:32:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01952v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01952v3,eess.SP
Combining Deep Learning and Linear Processing for Modulation   Classification and Symbol Decoding,"Samer Hanna, Chris Dick, Danijela Cabric","Deep learning has been recently applied to many problems in wireless communications including modulation classification and symbol decoding. Many of the existing end-to-end learning approaches demonstrated robustness to signal distortions like frequency and timing errors, and outperformed classical signal processing techniques with sufficient training. However, deep learning approaches typically require hundreds of thousands of floating points operations for inference, which is orders of magnitude higher than classical signal processing approaches and thus do not scale well for long sequences. Additionally, they typically operate as a black box and without insight on how their final output was obtained, they can't be integrated with existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines deep learning with linear signal processing typically done at the receiver to realize joint modulation classification and symbol recovery. The proposed method estimates signal parameters by learning and corrects signal distortions like carrier frequency offset and multipath fading by linear processing. Using this hybrid approach, we leverage the power of deep learning while retaining the efficiency of conventional receiver processing techniques for long sequences. The proposed hybrid approach provides good accuracy in signal distortion estimation leading to promising results in terms of symbol error rate. For modulation classification accuracy, it outperforms many state of the art deep learning networks.",2020-06-01T05:30:50Z,2020-09-13T20:36:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00729v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00729v2,eess.SP
ECG Language Processing (ELP): a New Technique to Analyze ECG Signals,"Sajad Mousavi, Fatemeh Afghah, Fatemeh Khadem, U. Rajendra Acharya","A language is constructed of a finite/infinite set of sentences composing of words. Similar to natural languages, Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the most common noninvasive tool to study the functionality of the heart and diagnose several abnormal arrhythmias, is made up of sequences of three or four distinct waves including the P-wave, QRS complex, T-wave and U-wave. An ECG signal may contain several different varieties of each wave (e.g., the QRS complex can have various appearances). For this reason, the ECG signal is a sequence of heartbeats similar to sentences in natural languages) and each heartbeat is composed of a set of waves (similar to words in a sentence) of different morphologies. Analogous to natural language processing (NLP) which is used to help computers understand and interpret the human's natural language, it is possible to develop methods inspired by NLP to aid computers to gain a deeper understanding of Electrocardiogram signals. In this work, our goal is to propose a novel ECG analysis technique, \textit{ECG language processing (ELP)}, focusing on empowering computers to understand ECG signals in a way physicians do. We evaluated the proposed method on two tasks including the classification of heartbeats and the detection of atrial fibrillation in the ECG signals. Experimental results on three databases (i.e., PhysionNet's MIT-BIH, MIT-BIH AFIB and PhysioNet Challenge 2017 AFIB Dataset databases) reveal that the proposed method is a general idea that can be applied to a variety of biomedical applications and is able to achieve remarkable performance.",2020-06-13T01:42:05Z,2020-06-13T01:42:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08841v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08841v1,"eess.SP, q-bio.QM"
A 1V 5-bits Low Power Level Crossing ADC with OFF state in idle time for   bio-medical applications in 0.18um CMOS,"Lucas Moura Santana, Duarte Lopes de Oliveira, Lester de Abreu Faria","The ubiquitous use of sensing and signal processing is increasing exponentially with the advance of the Internet of Everything (IoE). In this context, the design of every time more power efficient sensor nodes is a must. Within these nodes, one of the most power-hungry components are the analog-to-digital converters (ADC). These components are used everywhere to translate real-world analog signals into computer intelligible digital signals. One of the promising architecture for the sensing of physiological signals is the level crossing ADC due to the sparse characteristics of those signals. One of the challenges to improve the power efficiency of this type of ADC lies in the use of continuous comparators to keep track of the input signal within the voltage references. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of using continuous comparator which can be turned off without incurring error to the conversion of the level crossing ADC. New boundaries will be set for the correct behavior of the level crossing ADC together with the conditions for power saving with the proposed architecture. A 1V 5-bits level crossing ADC was implemented using the TSMC 0.18um process and fabricated for laboratory measurements. The ADC consumes 12.2uW during tracking state and with the proposed technique, the reduction of the average power can go from 4.2% to 45.5% depending on the activity and the type of the input signal.",2021-08-17T11:27:49Z,2021-08-17T11:27:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07564v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07564v1,eess.SP
Signal Processing over Multilayer Graphs: Theoretical Foundations and   Practical Applications,"Songyang Zhang, Qinwen Deng, Zhi Ding","Signal processing over single-layer graphs has become a mainstream tool owing to its power in revealing obscure underlying structures within data signals. However, many real-life datasets and systems, {including those in Internet of Things (IoT)}, are characterized by more complex interactions among distinct entities, which may represent multi-level interactions that are harder to be captured with a single-layer graph, and can be better characterized by multilayers graph connections. Such multilayer or multi-level data structure can be more naturally modeled by high-dimensional multilayer graphs (MLG)}. To generalize traditional graph signal processing (GSP) over multilayer graphs for analyzing multi-level signal features and their interactions, this work proposes a tensor-based framework of multilayer graph signal processing (M-GSP). Specifically, we introduce core concepts of M-GSP and study properties of MLG spectrum space, followed by fundamentals of MLG-based filter design. To illustrate novel aspects of M-GSP, we further explore its link with traditional signal processing and GSP. We provide example applications to demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of applying multilayer graphs and M-GSP in practical scenarios.",2021-08-31T06:35:04Z,2022-10-31T18:34:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13638v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13638v6,eess.SP
A whitening approach for Transfer Entropy permits the application to   narrow-band signals,"Christoph Daube, Joachim Gross, Robin A. A. Ince","Transfer Entropy, a generalisation of Granger Causality, promises to measure ""information transfer"" from a source to a target signal by ignoring self-predictability of a target signal when quantifying the source-target relationship. A simple example for signals with such self-predictability are narrowband signals. These are both thought to be intrinsically generated by the brain as well as commonly dealt with in analyses of brain signals, where band-pass filters are used to separate responses from noise. However, the use of Transfer Entropy is usually discouraged in such cases. We simulate simplistic examples where we confirm the failure of classic implementations of Transfer Entropy when applied to narrow-band signals, as made evident by a flawed recovery of effect sizes and interaction delays. We propose an alternative approach based on a whitening of the input signals before computing a bivariate measure of directional time-lagged dependency. This approach solves the problems found in the simple simulated systems. Finally, we explore the behaviour of our measure when applied to delta and theta response components in Magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to continuous speech. The small effects that our measure attributes to a directed interaction from the stimulus to the neuronal responses are stronger in the theta than in the delta band. This suggests that the delta band reflects a more predictive coupling, while the theta band is stronger involved in bottom-up, reactive processing. Taken together, we hope to increase the interest in directed perspectives on frequency-specific dependencies.",2022-01-07T14:19:00Z,2022-05-20T09:24:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02461v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02461v2,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.QM"
A third-order class-D amplifier with and without ripple compensation,"Stephen M. Cox, H. du Toit Mouton","We analyse the nonlinear behaviour of a third-order class-D amplifier, and demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the recently introduced ripple compensation (RC) technique in reducing the audio distortion of the device. The amplifier converts an input audio signal to a high-frequency train of rectangular pulses, whose widths are modulated according to the input signal (pulse-width modulation) and employs negative feedback. After determining the steady-state operating point for constant input and calculating its stability, we derive a small-signal model (SSM), which yields in closed form the transfer function relating (infinitesimal) input and output disturbances. This SSM shows how the RC technique is able to linearise the small-signal response of the device. We extend this SSM through a fully nonlinear perturbation calculation of the dynamics of the amplifier, based on the disparity in time scales between the pulse train and the audio signal. We obtain the nonlinear response of the amplifier to a general audio signal, avoiding the linearisation inherent in the SSM; we thereby more precisely quantify the reduction in distortion achieved through RC. Finally, simulations corroborate our theoretical predictions and illustrate the dramatic deterioration in performance that occurs when the amplifier is operated in an unstable regime. The perturbation calculation is rather general, and may be adapted to quantify the way in which other nonlinear negative-feedback pulse-modulated devices track a time-varying input signal that slowly modulates the system parameters.",2018-02-07T15:28:23Z,2018-02-07T15:28:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02983v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02983v1,eess.SP
A Novel Sub-Nyquist Multiband Signal Detection Algorithm for Cognitive   Radio,"Kai Cao, Peizhong Lu, Yan Zou, Lin Ling","Wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is an essential technology for cognitive radio. However, the sampling rate is still a bottleneck of WSS. Several sub-Nyquist sensing methods have been proposed. These technologies deteriorate in the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime or suffer high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel sub-Nyquist WSS method based on Multi-coset (MC) sampling. We design a simple SNR-robust and low-complexity multiband signal detection algorithm. In particular, the proposed method differs the commonly used detection algorithms which are based on energy detection (ED), matched filter (MF) or cyclostationary detection (CD). We exploit the linear recurrent relation between the locations of nonzero frequencies and the DFT of the arithmetic-shifted subsampled signals. These relations can be uniquely expressed by a series of the so-called frequency locator polynomials (FLPs). The scalar of the relations is related to the bandwidths of the subsignals. Basing on this, we propose a detector for sparse multiband signals along with the method estimating carrier frequency and bandwidth. The detector does not require priori knowledge about the frequency locations of the signals of interest. Moreover, it has lower complexity of both samples and computation compared to CD in sparse case. Experimental results show the detector outperforms ED in the sub-Nyquist regime especially in low SNRs.",2018-02-12T05:20:25Z,2018-02-12T05:20:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03897v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03897v1,eess.SP

Sampling and Reconstruction of Bandlimited Signals with Multi-Channel   Time Encoding,"Karen Adam, Adam Scholefield, Martin Vetterli","Sampling is classically performed by recording the amplitude of an input signal at given time instants; however, sampling and reconstructing a signal using multiple devices in parallel becomes a more difficult problem to solve when the devices have an unknown shift in their clocks.   Alternatively, one can record the times at which a signal (or its integral) crosses given thresholds. This can model integrate-and-fire neurons, for example, and has been studied by Lazar and T\'oth under the name of ``Time Encoding Machines''. This sampling method is closer to what is found in nature.   In this paper, we show that, when using time encoding machines, reconstruction from multiple channels has a more intuitive solution, and does not require the knowledge of the shifts between machines. We show that, if single-channel time encoding can sample and perfectly reconstruct a $\mathbf{2\Omega}$-bandlimited signal, then $\mathbf{M}$-channel time encoding with shifted integrators can sample and perfectly reconstruct a signal with $\mathbf{M}$ times the bandwidth.   Furthermore, we present an algorithm to perform this reconstruction and prove that it converges to the correct unique solution, in the noiseless case, without knowledge of the relative shifts between the integrators of the machines. This is quite unlike classical multi-channel sampling, where unknown shifts between sampling devices pose a problem for perfect reconstruction.",2019-07-12T10:59:14Z,2019-12-03T09:01:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05673v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05673v2,eess.SP

Time of arrival imaging: The proof of concept for a novel medical   imaging modality,Tao Feng,"It has been shown that with the use of ultra-wideband (UWB) electromagnetic signal and time of arrival (ToA) principle, it is possible to locate medical implants given the permittivity distribution of the body. We propose a new imaging modality using the reverse process to acquire permittivity distributions as a surrogate of human anatomy. In the proposed systems, the locations of the signal source, receiver, and signal shapes are assumed to be known exactly. The measured data is recorded as the time it takes for the signal to travel from the signal source to the signal receiver. The finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method is used for the modeling of signal propagation within the phantom, which is used for both simulation and image reconstruction. Image reconstruction is achieved using linear regression on the training pairs, which includes randomly generated images and its corresponding arrival times generated using the FDTD approach. The linear weights of the training images are generated to minimize the difference between the arrival time of the reconstruction image and the measured arrival time. A simulation study using UWB signal with the central frequency of 300 MHz and the Shepp-Logan phantom was carried out. Ten-picosecond timing resolution is used for the simulation and image reconstruction. The quantitative difference between the arrival times of the phantom and the reconstructed image reduced with an increased iteration number. The quantitative error of the reconstructed image reached below 10% after 900 iterations, and 8.4% after 1200 iterations. With additional post-smoothing to suppress the introduced noise pattern through reconstruction, 6.5% error was achieved.

Many UAVs adopt frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technology to efficiently and securely communicate with their radio controllers (RC) where the signal follows a hopping pattern to prevent harmful interference. In order to realistically distinguish the frequency hopping (FH) RC signals, one should consider the real-world radio propagation environment since many UAVs communicate with RCs from a far distance in which signal faces both slow and fast fading phenomenons. Therefore, in this study different from the literature, we consider a system that works under real-conditions by capturing over-the-air signals at hilly terrain suburban environments in the presence of foliages.

Furthermore, time guards associated with each hopping sequence are calculated using the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the STFT which results in differentiating the each UAV RC signal accurately.

On Goodness of WiFi based Monitoring of Vital Signs in the Wild,"Kamran Ali, Mohammed Alloulah, Fahim Kawsar, Alex X. Liu","WiFi channel state information (CSI) has emerged as a plausible modality for sensing different human vital signs, i.e. respiration and body motion, as a function of modulated wireless signals that travel between WiFi devices. Although a remarkable proposition, most of the existing research in this space struggles to withstand robust performance beyond experimental conditions. To this end, we take a careful look at the dynamics of WiFi signals under human respiration and body motions in the wild. We first characterize the WiFi signal components - multipath and signal subspace - that are modulated by human respiration and body motions. We extrapolate on a set of transformations, including first-order differentiation, max-min normalization and component projections, that faithfully explains and quantifies the dynamics of respiration and body motions on WiFi signals. Grounded in this characterization, we propose two methods: 1) a respiration tracking technique that models the peak dynamics observed in the time-varying signal subspaces and 2) a body-motion tracking technique built with a multi-dimensional clustering of evolving signal subspaces. Finally, we reflect on the manifestation of these techniques in a practical sleep monitoring application. Our systematic evaluation with over 550 hours of data from 5 users covering both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings shows that the proposed techniques can achieve comparable performance to purpose-built pulse-Doppler radar.",2020-03-12T17:38:00Z,2020-03-12T17:38:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09386v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09386v1,eess.SP
Enhanced Time-Frequency Representation and Mode Decomposition,"Haijian Zhang, Guang Hua","Time-frequency representation (TFR) allowing for mode reconstruction plays a significant role in interpreting and analyzing the nonstationary signal constituted of various modes. However, it is difficult for most previous methods to handle signal modes with closely-spaced or spectrally-overlapped instantaneous frequencies (IFs) especially in adverse environments. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced TFR and mode decomposition (ETFR-MD) method, which is particularly adapted to represent and decompose multi-mode signals with close or crossing IFs under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The emphasis of the proposed ETFR-MD is placed on accurate IF and instantaneous amplitude (IA) extraction of each signal mode based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT). First, we design an initial IF estimation method specifically for the cases involving crossing IFs. Further, a low-complexity mode enhancement scheme is proposed so that enhanced IFs better fit underlying IF laws. Finally, the IA extraction from signal's STFT coefficients combined with the enhanced IFs enables us to reconstruct each signal mode. In addition, we derive mathematical expressions that reveal optimal window lengths and separation interference of our method. The proposed ETFR-MD is compatible with previous related methods, thus can be regarded as a step toward a more general time-frequency representation and decomposition method. Experimental results confirm the superior performance of the ETFR-MD when compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark.",2020-08-30T10:38:35Z,2020-08-30T10:38:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13136v1,eess.SP
"An Error-Based Approximation Sensing Circuit for Event-Triggered, Low   Power Wearable Sensors","Silvio Zanoli, Flavio Ponzina, Tom√°s Teijeiro, Alexandre Levisse, David Atienza","Event-based sensors have the potential to optimize energy consumption at every stage in the signal processing pipeline, including data acquisition, transmission, processing and storage. However, almost all state-of-the-art systems are still built upon the classical Nyquist-based periodic signal acquisition. In this work, we design and validate the Polygonal Approximation Sampler (PAS), a novel circuit to implement a general-purpose event-based sampler using a polygonal approximation algorithm as the underlying sampling trigger. The circuit can be dynamically reconfigured to produce a coarse or a detailed reconstruction of the analog input, by adjusting the error threshold of the approximation. The proposed circuit is designed at the Register Transfer Level and processes each input sample received from the ADC in a single clock cycle. The PAS has been tested with three different types of archetypal signals captured by wearable devices (electrocardiogram, accelerometer and respiration data) and compared with a standard periodic ADC. These tests show that single-channel signals, with slow variations and constant segments (like the used single-lead ECG and the respiration signals) take great advantage from the used sampling technique, reducing the amount of data used up to 99% without significant performance degradation. At the same time, multi-channel signals (like the six-dimensional accelerometer signal) can still benefit from the designed circuit, achieving a reduction factor up to 80% with minor performance degradation. These results open the door to new types of wearable sensors with reduced size and higher battery lifetime.",2021-06-25T10:42:13Z,2023-05-11T10:29:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13545v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13545v2,eess.SP
Covariance Recovery for One-Bit Sampled Data With Time-Varying Sampling   Thresholds-Part II: Non-Stationary Signals,"Arian Eamaz, Farhang Yeganegi, Mojtaba Soltanalian","The recovery of the input signal covariance values from its one-bit sampled counterpart has been deemed a challenging task in the literature. To deal with its difficulties, some assumptions are typically made to find a relation between the input covariance matrix and the autocorrelation values of the one-bit sampled data. This includes the arcsine law and the modified arcsine law that were discussed in Part I of this work [2]. We showed that by facilitating the deployment of time-varying thresholds, the modified arcsine law has a promising performance in covariance recovery. However, the modified arcsine law also assumes input signals are stationary, which is typically a simplifying assumption for real-world applications. In fact, in many signal processing applications, the input signals are readily known to be non-stationary with a non-Toeplitz covariance matrix. In this paper, we propose an approach to extending the arcsine law to the case where one-bit ADCs apply time-varying thresholds while dealing with input signals that originate from a non-stationary process. In particular, the recovery methods are shown to accurately recover the time-varying variance and autocorrelation values. Furthermore, we extend the formulation of the Bussgang law to the case where non-stationary input signals are considered.",2022-03-16T18:04:18Z,2022-03-16T18:04:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17238v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17238v1,eess.SP
Acceleration-guided Acoustic Signal Denoising Framework Based on   Learnable Wavelet Transform Applied to Slab Track Condition Monitoring,"Baorui Dai, Ga√´tan Frusque, Qi Li, Olga Fink","Acoustic monitoring has recently shown great potential in the diagnosis of infrastructure condition. However, due to the severe noise interference in acoustic signals, meaningful features tend to be difficult to infer. It creates a considerable obstacle for an extensive application of acoustic monitoring. To tackle this problem, we propose an acceleration-guided acoustic signal denoising framework (AG-ASDF) based on learnable wavelet transform to automatically denoise the acoustic signal and extract the relevant features based on the acceleration signal. This denoising framework requires the acceleration signal only for the training stage. Therefore, only acoustic sensors (non-intrusive) need to be installed during the application phase, which is convenient and crucial for the condition monitoring of safety-critical infrastructure. A comparative study is conducted among the proposed AG-ASDF and other feature learning / extraction methods, by using a multi-class support vector machine to evaluate the detection effectiveness of slab track condition based on acoustic signals. Different healthy and unhealthy states of slab tracks are imitated with three types of slab track supporting conditions in a railway test line. The classification based on the proposed AG-ASDF features outperforms other feature extraction and learning methods with a significant accuracy improvement.",2022-05-11T09:23:34Z,2023-03-23T14:43:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05365v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05365v4,eess.SP
Fault Diagnosis of Inter-turn Short Circuit in Permanent Magnet   Synchronous Motors with Current Signal Imaging and Unsupervised Learning,"W. Jung, S. H. Yun, Y. S. Lim, S. Cheong, J. Bae, Y. H. Park","This paper proposes machine-independent feature engineering for winding inter-turn short circuit fault that uses electrical current signals. Electrical current signal collected from permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is subjected to different environmental and operational conditions. To solve these problems, robust current signal imaging method and deep learning-based feature extraction method are developed. The overall procedure includes the following three key steps: (1) transformation of a time-series current signal to two-dimensional image, (2) extracting features using convolutional neural networks, and (3) calculating a health indicator using Mahalanobis distance. Transformation of the time-series signal is based on recurrence plots (RP). The proposed RP method develops from feature engineering that provides the dominant fault feature representations in a robust way. The proposed RP is designed that maximizes the features of inter-turn short fault and minimizes the effect of noise from systems with various capacities. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, two case studies are conducted using an artificial fault seeded testbed with two different capacities of motor. By calculating the feature using only the electrical current signal of the motor without the parameters related to the capacity of the motor, the proposed feature can be applied to motors with different capacities while maintaining the same performance.",2022-06-09T08:23:15Z,2022-06-09T08:23:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07651v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07651v1,eess.SP
Robust Unlimited Sampling Beyond Modulo,"Eyar Azar, Satish Mulleti, Yonina C. Eldar","Analog to digital converters (ADCs) act as a bridge between the analog and digital domains. Two important attributes of any ADC are sampling rate and its dynamic range. For bandlimited signals, the sampling should be above the Nyquist rate. It is also desired that the signals' dynamic range should be within that of the ADC's; otherwise, the signal will be clipped. Nonlinear operators such as modulo or companding can be used prior to sampling to avoid clipping. To recover the true signal from the samples of the nonlinear operator, either high sampling rates are required or strict constraints on the nonlinear operations are imposed, both of which are not desirable in practice. In this paper, we propose a generalized flexible nonlinear operator which is sampling efficient. Moreover, by carefully choosing its parameters, clipping, modulo, and companding can be seen as special cases of it. We show that bandlimited signals are uniquely identified from the nonlinear samples of the proposed operator when sampled above the Nyquist rate. Furthermore, we propose a robust algorithm to recover the true signal from the nonlinear samples. We show that our algorithm has the lowest mean-squared error while recovering the signal for a given sampling rate, noise level, and dynamic range of the compared to existing algorithms. Our results lead to less constrained hardware design to address the dynamic range issues while operating at the lowest rate possible.",2022-06-29T13:53:14Z,2022-06-29T13:53:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14656v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14656v1,eess.SP
Data-driven Signal Decomposition Approaches: A Comparative Analysis,"Thomas Eriksen, Naveed ur Rehman","Signal decomposition (SD) approaches aim to decompose non-stationary signals into their constituent amplitude- and frequency-modulated components. This represents an important preprocessing step in many practical signal processing pipelines, providing useful knowledge and insight into the data and relevant underlying system(s) while also facilitating tasks such as noise or artefact removal and feature extraction. The popular SD methods are mostly data-driven, striving to obtain inherent well-behaved signal components without making many prior assumptions on input data. Among those methods include empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and variants, variational mode decomposition (VMD) and variants, synchrosqueezed transform (SST) and variants and sliding singular spectrum analysis (SSA). With the increasing popularity and utility of these methods in wide-ranging application, it is imperative to gain a better understanding and insight into the operation of these algorithms, evaluate their accuracy with and without noise in input data and gauge their sensitivity against algorithmic parameter changes. In this work, we achieve those tasks through extensive experiments involving carefully designed synthetic and real-life signals. Based on our experimental observations, we comment on the pros and cons of the considered SD algorithms as well as highlighting the best practices, in terms of parameter selection, for the their successful operation. The SD algorithms for both single- and multi-channel (multivariate) data fall within the scope of our work. For multivariate signals, we evaluate the performance of the popular algorithms in terms of fulfilling the mode-alignment property, especially in the presence of noise.",2022-08-23T11:08:23Z,2022-09-02T14:00:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10874v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10874v2,eess.SP
Compressive Sensing of ECG Signals using Plug-and-Play Regularization,"Unni VS, Ruturaj Gavaskar, Kunal Narayan Chaudhury","Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently attracted attention for ECG data compression. In CS, an ECG signal is projected onto a small set of random vectors. Recovering the original signal from such compressed measurements remains a challenging problem. Traditional recovery methods are based on solving a regularized minimization problem, where a sparsity-promoting prior is used. In this paper, we propose an alternative iterative recovery algorithm based on the Plug-and-Play (PnP) method, which has recently become popular for imaging problems. In PnP, a powerful denoiser is used to implicitly perform regularization, instead of using hand-crafted regularizers; this has been found to be more successful than traditional methods. In this work, we use a PnP version of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm for ECG recovery. To ensure mathematical convergence of the PnP algorithm, the signal denoiser in question needs to satisfy some technical conditions. We use a high-quality ECG signal denoiser fulfilling this condition by learning a Bayesian prior for small-sized signal patches. This guarantees that the proposed algorithm converges to a fixed point irrespective of the initialization. Importantly, through extensive experiments, we show that the reconstruction quality of the proposed method is superior to that of state-of-the-art methods.",2022-10-15T05:55:30Z,2022-10-15T05:55:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08204v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08204v1,eess.SP
HKF: Hierarchical Kalman Filtering with Online Learned Evolution Priors   for Adaptive ECG Denoising,"Guy Revach, Timur Locher, Nir Shlezinger, Ruud J. G. van Sloun, Rik Vullings","Electrocardiography (ECG) signals play a pivotal role in many healthcare applications, especially in at-home monitoring of vital signs. Wearable technologies, which these applications often depend upon, frequently produce low-quality ECG signals. While several methods exist for ECG denoising to enhance signal quality and aid clinical interpretation, they often underperform with ECG data from wearable technology due to limited noise tolerance or inadequate flexibility in capturing ECG dynamics. This paper introduces HKF, a hierarchical and adaptive Kalman filter, which uses a proprietary state space model to effectively capture both intra- and inter-heartbeat dynamics for ECG signal denoising. HKF learns a patient-specific structured prior for the ECG signal's intra-heartbeat dynamics in an online manner, resulting in a filter that adapts to the specific ECG signal characteristics of each patient. In an empirical study, HKF demonstrated superior denoising performance (reduced mean-squared error) while preserving the unique properties of the waveform. In a comparative analysis, HKF outperformed previously proposed methods for ECG denoising, such as the model-based Kalman filter and data-driven autoencoders.

POCS-based framework of signal reconstruction from generalized   non-uniform samples,"Nguyen T. Thao, Dominik Rzepka, Marek Mi≈õkowicz","We formalize the use of projections onto convex sets (POCS) for the reconstruction of signals from non-uniform samples in their highest generality. This covers signals in any Hilbert space $\mathscr H$, including multi-dimensional and multi-channel signals, and samples that are most generally inner products of the signals with given kernel functions in $\mathscr H$. An attractive feature of the POCS method is the unconditional convergence of its iterates to an estimate that is consistent with the samples of the input, even when these samples are of very heterogeneous nature on top of their non-uniformity, and/or under insufficient sampling. Moreover, the error of the iterates is systematically monotonically decreasing, and their limit retrieves the input signal whenever the samples are uniquely characteristic of this signal. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the case where the sampling kernel functions are orthogonal in $\mathscr H$, while the input may be confined in a smaller closed space $\mathscr A$ (of bandlimitation for example). This covers the increasingly popular application of time encoding by integration, including multi-channel encoding. We push the analysis of the POCS method in this case by giving a special parallelized version of it, showing its connection with the pseudo-inversion of the linear operator defined by the samples, and giving a multiplierless discrete-time implementation of it that paradoxically accelerates the convergence of the iteration.",2022-12-10T01:05:54Z,2022-12-10T01:05:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05163v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05163v1,eess.SP
Two Measure is Two Know: Calibration-free Full Duplex Monitoring for   Software Radio Platforms,"Jie Wang, Jonathan Gornet, Alex Orange, Leigh Stoller, Gary Wong, Jacobus Van Der Merwe, Sneha Kumar Kasera, Neal Patwari","Future virtualized radio access network (vRAN) infrastructure providers (and today's experimental wireless testbed providers) may be simultaneously uncertain what signals are being transmitted by their base stations and legally responsible for their violations. These providers must monitor the spectrum of transmissions and external signals without access to the radio itself. In this paper, we propose FDMonitor, a full-duplex monitoring system attached between a transmitter and its antenna to achieve this goal. Measuring the signal at this point on the RF path is necessary but insufficient since the antenna is a bidirectional device. FDMonitor thus uses a bidirectional coupler, a two-channel receiver, and a new source separation algorithm to simultaneously estimate the transmitted signal and the signal incident on the antenna. Rather than requiring an offline calibration, we also adaptively estimate the linear model for the system on the fly. FDMonitor has been running on a real-world open wireless testbed, monitoring 19 SDR platforms controlled (with bare metal access) by outside experimenters over a seven month period, sending alerts whenever a violation is observed. Our experimental results show that FDMonitor accurately separates signals across a range of signal parameters.

Time-Varying Graph Mode Decomposition,Naveed ur Rehman,"Time-varying graph signals are alternative representation of multivariate (or multichannel) signals in which a single time-series is associated with each of the nodes or vertex of a graph. Aided by the graph-theoretic tools, time-varying graph models have the ability to capture the underlying structure of the data associated with multiple nodes of a graph -- a feat that is hard to accomplish using standard signal processing approaches. The aim of this contribution is to propose a method for the decomposition of time-varying graph signals into a set of graph modes. The graph modes can be interpreted in terms of their temporal, spectral and topological characteristics. From the temporal (spectral) viewpoint, the graph modes represent the finite number of oscillatory signal components (output of multiple band-pass filters whose center frequencies and bandwidths are learned in a fully data-driven manner), similar in properties to those obtained from the empirical mode decomposition and related approaches. From the topological perspective, the graph modes quantify the functional connectivity of the graph vertices at multiple scales based on their signal content. In order to estimate the graph modes, a variational optimization formulation is designed that includes necessary temporal, spectral and topological requirements relevant to the graph modes. An efficient method to solve that problem is developed which is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the primal-dual optimization approach. Finally, the ability of the method to enable a joint analysis of the temporal and topological characteristics of time-varying graph signals, at multiple frequency bands/scales, is demonstrated on a series of synthetic and real time-varying graph data sets.",2023-01-09T16:36:43Z,2023-01-09T16:36:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03496v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03496v1,eess.SP
Active RIS-Assisted mmWave Indoor Signal Enhancement Based on   Transparent RIS,"Hao Feng, Yuping Zhao","Due to the serious path loss of millimeter-wave (mmWave), the signal sent by the base station is seriously attenuated when it reaches the indoors. Recent studies have proposed a glass-based metasurface that can enhance mmWave indoor signals. The transparent reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) focuses on the mmWave signal to a specific location indoors. In this paper, a novel RIS-assisted mmWave indoor enhancement scheme is proposed, in which a transparent RIS is deployed on the glass to enhance mmWave indoor signals, and three assisted transmission scenarios, namely passive RIS (PRIS), active RIS (ARIS), and a novel hybrid RIS (HRIS) are proposed. This paper aims to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal for the three assisted transmission scenarios. The closed-form solution to the maximum SNR is presented in the PRIS and the ARIS-assisted transmission scenarios. Meanwhile, the closed-form solution to the maximum SNR for the HRIS-assisted transmission scenario is presented for given active unit cells. In addition, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed under three assisted transmission scenarios. The results indicate that under a specific RIS power budget, the ARIS-assisted transmission scenario achieves the highest data rate and energy efficiency. Also, it requires very few unit cells, thus dramatically reducing the size of the metasurface.",2023-05-16T07:09:56Z,2023-05-16T07:09:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09228v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09228v1,eess.SP
Verifying the Smoothness of Graph Signals: A Graph Signal Processing   Approach,"Lital Dabush, Tirza Routtenberg","Graph signal processing (GSP) deals with the representation, analysis, and processing of structured data, i.e. graph signals that are defined on the vertex set of a generic graph. A crucial prerequisite for applying various GSP and graph neural network (GNN) approaches is that the examined signals are smooth graph signals with respect to the underlying graph, or, equivalently, have low graph total variation (TV). In this paper, we develop GSP-based approaches to verify the validity of the smoothness assumption of given signals (data) and an associated graph. The proposed approaches are based on the representation of network data as the output of a graph filter with a given graph topology. In particular, we develop two smoothness detectors for the graph-filter-output model: 1) the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for known model parameters; and 2) a semi-parametric detector that estimates the graph filter and then validates its smoothness. The properties of the proposed GSP-based detectors are investigated, and some special cases are discussed. The performance of the GSP-based detectors is evaluated using synthetic data, data from the IEEE 14-bus power system, and measurements from a network of light intensity sensors, under different setups.

Low-Cost GNSS Simulators with Wireless Clock Synchronization for Indoor   Positioning,"Woohyun Kim, Jiwon Seo","In regions where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals are unavailable, such as underground areas and tunnels, GNSS simulators can be deployed for transmitting simulated GNSS signals. Then, a GNSS receiver in the simulator coverage outputs the position based on the received GNSS signals (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 signals in this study) transmitted by the corresponding simulator. This approach provides periodic position updates to GNSS users while deploying a small number of simulators without modifying the hardware and software of user receivers. However, the simulator clock should be synchronized to the GNSS satellite clock to generate almost identical signals to the live-sky GNSS signals, which is necessary for seamless indoor and outdoor positioning handover. The conventional clock synchronization method based on the wired connection between each simulator and an outdoor GNSS antenna causes practical difficulty and increases the cost of deploying the simulators. This study proposes a wireless clock synchronization method based on a private time server and time delay calibration. Additionally, we derived the constraints for determining the optimal simulator coverage and separation between adjacent simulators. The positioning performance of the proposed GPS simulator-based indoor positioning system was demonstrated in the underground testbed for a driving vehicle with a GPS receiver and a pedestrian with a smartphone. The average position errors were 3.7 m for the vehicle and 9.6 m for the pedestrian during the field tests with successful indoor and outdoor positioning handovers. Since those errors are within the coverage of each deployed simulator, it is confirmed that the proposed system with wireless clock synchronization can effectively provide periodic position updates to users where live-sky GNSS signals are unavailable.",2023-06-01T12:58:27Z,2023-06-01T12:58:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00633v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00633v1,eess.SP
Neuromorphic Sampling of Sparse Signals,"Abijith Jagannath Kamath, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula","Neuromorphic sampling is a bioinspired and opportunistic analog-to-digital conversion technique, where the measurements are recorded only when there is a significant change in the signal amplitude. Neuromorphic sampling has paved the way for a new class of vision sensors called event cameras or dynamic vision sensors (DVS), which consume low power, accommodate a high-dynamic range, and provide sparse measurements with high temporal resolution making it convenient for downstream inference tasks. In this paper, we consider neuromorphic sensing of signals with a finite rate of innovation (FRI), including a stream of Dirac impulses, sum of weighted and time-shifted pulses, and piecewise-polynomial functions. We consider a sampling-theoretic approach and leverage the close connection between neuromorphic sensing and time-based sampling, where the measurements are encoded temporally. Using Fourier-domain analysis, we show that perfect signal reconstruction is possible via parameter estimation using high-resolution spectral estimation methods. We develop a kernel-based sampling approach, which allows for perfect reconstruction with a sample complexity equal to the rate of innovation of the signal. We provide sufficient conditions on the parameters of the neuromorphic encoder for perfect reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to multichannel neuromorphic sampling of FRI signals, in the single-input multi-output (SIMO) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) configurations. We show that the signal parameters can be jointly estimated using multichannel measurements.

Mapping Information in Feature Extraction Transformation for Chirp   Signal,"Shuyi Gu, Zhenghua Luo, Lin Hu, Yilin Zhang, Junxiong Guo","Chirp signals have established diverse applications caused by the capable of producing time-dependent linear frequencies. Most feature extraction transformation methods for chirp signals focus on enhancing the performance of transform methods but neglecting the information derived from the transformation process. Consequently, they may fail to fully exploit the information from observations, resulting in decreased performance under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio and limited observations. In this work, we develop a novel post-processing method called mapping information model to addressing this challenge. The model establishes a link between the observation space and feature space in feature extraction transform, enabling interference suppression and obtain more accurate information by iteratively resampling and assigning weights in both spaces. Analysis of the iteration process reveals a continual increase in weight of signal samples and a gradual stability in weight of noise samples. The demonstration of the noise suppression in the iteration process and feature enhancement supports the effectiveness of the mapping information model. Furthermore, numerical simulations also affirm the high efficiency of the proposed model by showcasing enhanced signal detection and estimation performances without requiring additional observations. This superior model allows amplifying performance within feature extraction transformation for chirp signal processing under low SNR and limited observation conditions, opens up new opportunities for areas such as communication, biomedicine, and remote sensing.",2024-01-10T08:37:43Z,2024-01-10T08:37:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05000v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05000v1,eess.SP

Although a broad variety of methods have been proposed for that purpose, often they substantially alter the original signal morphology or are computationally expensive. Hence, the present work introduces a simple and efficient algorithm to suppress the PLI from the ECG. Briefly, the input signal is decomposed into four Wavelet levels and the resulting coefficients are thresholded to remove the PLI estimated from the TQ intervals. The denoised ECG signal is then reconstructed by computing the inverse Wavelet transform. The method has been validated making use of fifty 10-min length clean ECG segments obtained from the MIT BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm database, which were contaminated with a sinusoidal signal of 50 Hz and variable harmonic content. Comparing the original and denoised ECG signals through a signed correlation index, improvements between 10 - 72% have been observed with respect to common adaptive notch filtering, implemented for comparison. These results suggest that the proposed method is featured by an enhanced trade-off between noise reduction and signal morphology preservation.",2024-01-19T13:56:22Z,2024-01-19T13:56:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10694v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10694v1,eess.SP
Unified Integrated Sensing and Communication Signal Design: A Sphere   Packing Perspective,"Shuaishuai Guo, Kaiqian Qu","The design of communication signal sets is fundamentally a sphere packing problem. It aims to identify a set of M points in an N -dimensional space, with the objective of maximizing the separability of points that represent different bits.In contrast, signals used for sensing targets should ideally be asdeterministic as possible. This paper explores the inherent conflict and trade-off between communication and sensing when these functions are combined within the same signal set. We present a unified approach to signal design in the time, frequency, and space domains for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), framing it as a modified sphere packing problem. Through adept formula manipulation, this problem is transformed into a large-scale quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) challenge. We propose an augmented Lagrangian and dual ascent (ALDA) algorithm for iterative problem-solving. The computational complexity of this approach is analyzed and found to be daunting for large, high-dimensional signal set designs. To address this, we introduce a bit-dimension-power splitting (BDPS) method. This method decomposes the large-scale QCQP into a series of smaller-scale problems that can be solved more efficiently and in parallel, significantly reducing the overall computational load. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed signal design methods in the context of ISAC.",2024-03-25T06:48:56Z,2024-08-04T09:42:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16468v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16468v2,eess.SP
Speech-dependent Data Augmentation for Own Voice Reconstruction with   Hearable Microphones in Noisy Environments,"Mattes Ohlenbusch, Christian Rollwage, Simon Doclo","Own voice pickup for hearables in noisy environments benefits from using both an outer and an in-ear microphone outside and inside the occluded ear. Due to environmental noise recorded at both microphones, and amplification of the own voice at low frequencies and band-limitation at the in-ear microphone, an own voice reconstruction system is needed to enable communication. A large amount of own voice signals is required to train a supervised deep learning-based own voice reconstruction system. Training data can either be obtained by recording a large amount of own voice signals of different talkers with a specific device, which is costly, or through augmentation of available speech data. Own voice signals can be simulated by assuming a linear time-invariant relative transfer function between hearable microphones for each phoneme, referred to as own voice transfer characteristics. In this paper, we propose data augmentation techniques for training an own voice reconstruction system based on speech-dependent models of own voice transfer characteristics between hearable microphones. The proposed techniques use few recorded own voice signals to estimate transfer characteristics and can then be used to simulate a large amount of own voice signals based on single-channel speech signals. Experimental results show that the proposed speech-dependent individual data augmentation technique leads to better performance compared to other data augmentation techniques or compared to training only on the available recorded own voice signals, and additional fine-tuning on the available recorded signals can improve performance further.",2024-05-19T15:56:03Z,2024-05-19T15:56:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11592v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11592v1,eess.AS
Causal loop and Stock-Flow Modeling of Signal Transduction Pathways,"Sadegh Sulaimany, Gholamreza Bidkhori, Sarbaz H. A. Khoshnaw","System dynamics is a popular approach in many fields of science and technology, but it has not been investigated for cell signaling pathways yet. It is a well formulated methodology used to analyze the components of a system considering the cause-effect relationships. The two main components of system dynamics modeling, Causal Loop and Stocks-Flow diagrams, make possible to model the dynamics of the system with the ability to analyze it both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this paper, after introducing the system dynamics modeling approach, and giving a simple example from its usage for Michaelis Menton reactions, a three-step process is proposed for signal transduction modeling. Then in a complete example, it is applied to a case study in cell signaling pathways, namely the RKIP Influence on the ERK signaling pathway and the results is compared with an integrative modeling approach based on Petri net and ODEs. Computational simulations show the success of the system dynamic in easier and effective modeling of the cell signaling pathways, in addition to its diverse options for understanding and testing the pathway quantitatively and quantitatively at the same time in relation to other methods. More intestinally, the suggested approach here helps one to identify all biochemical reaction paths and loops for complex cell signaling pathways.

WAND: Wavelet Analysis-based Neural Decomposition of MRS Signals for   Artifact Removal,"Julian P. Merkofer, Dennis M. J. van de Sande, Sina Amirrajab, Kyung Min Nam, Ruud J. G. van Sloun, Alex A. Bhogal","Accurate quantification of metabolites in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is challenged by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), overlapping metabolites, and various artifacts. Particularly, unknown and unparameterized baseline effects obscure the quantification of low-concentration metabolites, limiting MRS reliability. This paper introduces wavelet analysis-based neural decomposition (WAND), a novel data-driven method designed to decompose MRS signals into their constituent components: metabolite-specific signals, baseline, and artifacts. WAND takes advantage of the enhanced separability of these components within the wavelet domain. The method employs a neural network, specifically a U-Net architecture, trained to predict masks for wavelet coefficients obtained through the continuous wavelet transform. These masks effectively isolate desired signal components in the wavelet domain, which are then inverse-transformed to obtain separated signals. Notably, an artifact mask is created by inverting the sum of all known signal masks, enabling WAND to capture and remove even unpredictable artifacts. The effectiveness of WAND in achieving accurate decomposition is demonstrated through numerical evaluations using simulated spectra. Furthermore, WAND's artifact removal capabilities significantly enhance the quantification accuracy of linear combination model fitting. The method's robustness is further validated using data from the 2016 MRS Fitting Challenge and in-vivo experiments.",2024-10-14T12:24:00Z,2024-10-14T12:24:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10427v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10427v1,eess.SP

This paper Proposes MaintAGT, a professional large model for intelligent operations and maintenance, aimed at addressing this issue. The system comprises three key components: a signal-to-text model, a pure text model, and a multimodal model. Firstly, the signal-to-text model was designed to convert raw signal data into textual descriptions, bridging the gap between signal data and text-based analysis. Secondly, the pure text model was fine-tuned using the GLM4 model with specialized knowledge to enhance its understanding of domain-specific texts. Finally, these two models were integrated to develop a comprehensive multimodal model that effectively processes and analyzes both signal and textual data.The dataset used for training and evaluation was sourced from academic papers, textbooks, international standards, and vibration analyst training materials, undergoing meticulous preprocessing to ensure high-quality data. As a result, the model has demonstrated outstanding performance across multiple intelligent operations and maintenance tasks, providing a low-cost, high-quality method for constructing large-scale monitoring signal-text description-fault pattern datasets. Experimental results indicate that the model holds significant advantages in condition monitoring, signal processing, and fault diagnosis.In the constructed general test set, MaintAGT achieved an accuracy of 70%, surpassing all existing general large language models and reaching the level of an ISO Level III human vibration analyst.This advancement signifies a crucial step forward from traditional maintenance practices toward intelligent and AI-driven maintenance solutions.",2024-11-30T13:40:54Z,2024-11-30T13:40:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00481v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00481v1,eess.SP
Efficient Sampling Allocation Strategies for General Graph-Filter-Based   Signal Recovery,"Lital Dabush, Tirza Routtenberg","Sensor placement plays a crucial role in graph signal recovery in underdetermined systems. In this paper, we present the graph-filtered regularized maximum likelihood (GFR-ML) estimator of graph signals, which integrates general graph filtering with regularization to enhance signal recovery performance under a limited number of sensors. Then, we investigate task-based sampling allocation aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the GFR-ML estimator by wisely choosing sensor placement. Since this MSE depends on the unknown graph signals to be estimated, we propose four cost functions for the optimization of the sampling allocation: the biased Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao bound (bCRB), the worst-case MSE (WC-MSE), the Bayesian MSE (BMSE), and the worst-case BMSE (WC-BMSE), where the last two assume a Gaussian prior. We investigate the properties of these cost functions and develop two algorithms for their practical implementation: 1) the straightforward greedy algorithm; and 2) the alternating projection gradient descent (PGD) algorithm that reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results on synthetic and real-world datasets of the IEEE 118-bus power system and the Minnesota road network demonstrate that the proposed sampling allocation methods reduce the MSE by up to $50\%$ compared to the common sampling methods A-design, E-design, and LR-design in the tested scenarios. Thus, the proposed methods improve the estimation performance and reduce the required number of measurements in graph signal processing (GSP)-based signal recovery in the case of underdetermined systems.",2025-02-08T14:17:33Z,2025-02-08T14:17:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05583v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05583v1,eess.SP
Dynamic Studies of Scaffold-dependent Mating Pathway in Yeast,"Danying Shao, Wen Zheng, Wenjun Qiu, Qi Ouyang, Chao Tang","The mating pathway in \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} is one of the best understood signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes. It transmits the mating signal from plasma membrane into the nucleus through the G-protein coupled receptor and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. According to the current understandings of the mating pathway, we construct a system of ordinary differential equations to describe the process. Our model is consistent with a wide range of experiments, indicating that it captures some main characteristics of the signal transduction along the pathway. Investigation with the model reveals that the shuttling of the scaffold protein and the dephosphorylation of kinases involved in the MAPK cascade cooperate to regulate the response upon pheromone induction and to help preserving the fidelity of the mating signaling. We explored factors affecting the dose-response curves of this pathway and found that both negative feedback and concentrations of the proteins involved in the MAPK cascade play crucial role. Contrary to some other MAPK systems where signaling sensitivity is being amplified successively along the cascade, here the mating signal is transmitted through the cascade in an almost linear fashion.",2006-09-11T05:11:22Z,2006-09-11T05:11:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0609015v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0609015v1,q-bio.MN
An FFT based measure of phase synchronization,Kaushik Majumdar,"In this paper phase of a signal has been viewed from a different angle. According to this view a signal can have countably infinitely many phases, one associated with each Fourier component. In other words each frequency has a phase associated with it. It has been shown that if two signals are phase synchronous then the difference between phases at a given component changes very slowly across the subsequent components. This leads to an FFT based phase synchronization measuring algorithm between any two signals. The algorithm does not take any more time than the FFT itself.

Self assembly of a model multicellular organism resembling the   Dictyostelium slime molds,"Graeme J. Ackland, Richard D. L. Hanes, Morrel H. Cohen","The evolution of multicellular organisms from monocellular ancestors represents one of the greatest advances of the history of life. The assembly of such multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells: over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely sophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms may not be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are interested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still achieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing spiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug.

A three-state kinetic mechanism for scaffold mediated signal   transduction,Jason W. Locasale,"Signaling events in eukaryotic cells are often guided by a scaffolding protein. Scaffold proteins assemble multiple proteins in a spatially localized signaling complex and exert numerous physical effects on signaling pathways. To study these effects, we consider a minimal, three-state kinetic model of scaffold mediated kinase activation. We first introduce and apply a path summation technique to obtain approximate solutions to a single molecule master equation that governs protein kinase activation. We then consider exact numerical solutions. We comment on when this approximation is appropriate and then use this analysis to illustrate the competition of processes occurring at many time scales involved in signal transduction in the presence of a scaffold protein. The findings are consistent with recent experiments and simulation data. Our results provide a framework and offer a mechanism for understanding how scaffold proteins can influence the shape of the waiting time distribution of kinase activation and effectively broaden the times over which protein kinases are activated in the course of cell signaling.",2008-07-04T15:38:44Z,2008-07-04T15:38:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0780v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0780v1,"q-bio.SC, q-bio.MN"

The quorum-sensing network of the marine bacterium {\it Vibrio harveyi} employs three autoinducers, each known to encode distinct ecological information. Yet how cells integrate and interpret the information contained within the three autoinducer signals remains a mystery. Here, we develop a new framework for analyzing signal integration based on Information Theory and use it to analyze quorum sensing in {\it V. harveyi}. We quantify how much the cells can learn about individual autoinducers and explain the experimentally observed input-output relation of the {\it V. harveyi} quorum-sensing circuit. Our results suggest that the need to limit interference between input signals places strong constraints on the architecture of bacterial signal-integration networks, and that bacteria likely have evolved active strategies for minimizing this interference.

Signal processing in local neuronal circuits based on activity-dependent   noise and competition,"Vladislav Volman, Herbert Levine","We study the characteristics of weak signal detection by a recurrent neuronal network with plastic synaptic coupling. It is shown that in the presence of an asynchronous component in synaptic transmission, the network acquires selectivity with respect to the frequency of weak periodic stimuli. For non-periodic frequency-modulated stimuli, the response is quantified by the mutual information between input (signal) and output (network's activity), and is optimized by synaptic depression. Introducing correlations in signal structure resulted in the decrease of input-output mutual information. Our results suggest that in neural systems with plastic connectivity, information is not merely carried passively by the signal; rather, the information content of the signal itself might determine the mode of its processing by a local neuronal circuit.",2009-07-15T21:50:05Z,2009-07-20T18:26:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2714v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.2714v2,q-bio.NC

However, existing methods analyzing robustness and sensitivity of signaling networks ignore the experimentally observed cell-to-cell variations of protein abundances and cell functions or contain ad hoc assumptions. We propose and apply a data driven Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based method to quantify robustness and sensitivity of Escherichia coli (E. coli) chemotaxis signaling network. Our analysis correctly rank orders different models of E. coli chemotaxis based on their robustness and suggests that parameters regulating cell signaling are evolutionary selected to vary in individual cells according to their abilities to perturb cell functions. Furthermore, predictions from our approach regarding distribution of protein abundances and properties of chemotactic responses in individual cells based on cell population averaged data are in excellent agreement with their experimental counterparts. Our approach is general and can be used to evaluate robustness as well as generate predictions of single cell properties based on population averaged experimental data in a wide range of cell signaling systems.",2013-05-16T19:46:09Z,2013-10-29T20:28:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3902v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.3902v2,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.MN"
Modular organization of cancer signaling networks is associated with   patient survivability,"Kazuhiro Takemoto, Kaori Kihara","Molecular signaling networks are believed to determine cancer robustness. Although cancer patient survivability was reported to correlate with the heterogeneous connectivity of the signaling networks inspired by theoretical studies on the increase of network robustness due to the heterogeneous connectivity, other theoretical and data analytic studies suggest an alternative explanation: the impact of modular organization of networks on biological robustness or adaptation to changing environments. In this study, thus, we evaluate whether the modularity--robustness hypothesis is applicable to cancer using network analysis. We focus on 14 specific cancer types whose molecular signaling networks are available in databases, and show that modular organization of cancer signaling networks is associated with the patient survival rate. In particular, the cancers with less modular signaling networks are more curable. This result is consistent with a prediction from the modularity--robustness hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that the network modularity is a better descriptor of the patient survival rate than the heterogeneous connectivity. However, these results do not contradict the importance of the heterogeneous connectivity. Rather, they provide new and different insights into the relationship between cellular networks and cancer behaviors.

Solving Hodgkin-Huxley equations using the compact difference scheme   -tapering dendrite,"Asha Gopinathan, Joseph Mathew","Dendritic processing is now considered to be important in pre-processing of signals coming into a cell. Dendrites are involved in both propagation and backpropagation of signals. In a cylindrical dendrite, signals moving in either direction will be similar. However, if the dendrites taper, then this is not the case any more. The picture gets more complex if the ion channel distribution along the dendrite is also non-uniform. These equations have been solved using the Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method. Here we look at non-uniform dendritic voltage gated channels in both cylindrical and tapering dendrites. For back-propagating signals, the signal is accentuated in the case of tapering dendrites. We assume a Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of ion channels and solve these equations with the compact finite-difference scheme. The scheme gives spectral-like spatial resolution while being easier to solve than spectral methods. We show that the scheme is able to reproduce the results obtained from spectral methods. The compact difference scheme is widely used to study turbulence in airflow, however it is being used for the first time in our laboratory to solve the equations involving transmission of signals in the brain.",2013-08-08T09:02:42Z,2013-09-27T06:51:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1788v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1788v2,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.QM"

However constraints are identified as a separate portfolio and attribution for each signal that are used to predict future returns thus corresponds to unconstrained signal portfolios. We propose a novel attribution method that put predictive signals at the core of attribution and allows to include the effect of constraints in portfolios attributed to every signal.

Many of the molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient spine expansion in response to calcium-influx due to NMDA receptor activation. We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in signaling networks and their role is to control both the activation and inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume). Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion including CaMKII, RhoA, and Cdc42 and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical signaling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remodeling events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics.

Invasive melanoma cells were observed migrating on surfaces with topography (array of posts), coated with adhesive molecules (fibronectin, FN) by Park et al., 2016. Several distinct qualitative behaviors they observed included persistent polarity, oscillation between the cell front and back, and random dynamics. To gain insight into the link between intracellular and ECM signaling, we compared experimental observations to a sequence of mathematical models encoding distinct hypotheses. The successful model required several critical factors. (1) Competition of lamellipodia for limited pools of GTPases. (2) Protrusion / contraction of lamellipodia influence ECM signaling.

The results show that the key lies in the correlation properties of the time series under consideration. It is found that signals with long range correlations are particularly suitable for this type of compression, where inflection points contain most of the information.

Denoising Signals in Cognitive Radio Systems Using An Evolutionary   Algorithm Based Adaptive Filter,"Adnan Quadri, Mohsen Riahi Manesh, Naima Kaabouch","Noise originating from several sources in a RF environment degrades the performance of communication systems. In wideband systems, such as cognitive radios, noise at the receiver can originate from non-linearity present in the RF front end, time-varying thermal noise within the receiver radio system, and noise from adjacent network nodes. Several denoising techniques have been proposed for cognitive radios, some of which are applied during spectrum sensing and others to received noisy signal during communication. Examples of some of these techniques used for noise cancellation in received signals are least mean square (LMS) and its variants. However, these algorithms have low performance with non-linear signals and cannot locate a global optimum solution for noise cancellation. Therefore, application of global search optimization techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, is considered for noise cancellation. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and LMS algorithms are implemented and their performances are evaluated. Extensive simulations were performed where Gaussian and non-linear random noise were added to the transmitted signal. The performance comparison was done using two metrics: bit error rate and mean square error.

Improved Detection Performance of Passive Radars Exploiting Known   Communication Signal Form,"Anantha K. Karthik, Rick S.

A generalized likelihood ratio test is derived, assuming prior knowledge of the signal format used in the non-cooperative transmit stations. We consider scenarios in which the unknown transmitted signal uses either a linear digital modulation scheme or the Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme. These digital modulation schemes are used in popular standards including Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T) and Long Term Evaluation (LTE). The performance of the generalized likelihood ratio test in the known signal format case is often significantly more favorable when compared to the case that does not exploit this information. Further, the performance improves with increasing number of samples per symbol and, for a sufficiently large number of samples per symbol, the performance closely approximates that of an active radar with a known transmitted signal.",2018-05-03T18:41:06Z,2018-05-03T18:41:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01503v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01503v1,eess.SP
An Inner SOCP Approximate Algorithm for Robust Adaptive Beamforming for   General-Rank Signal Model,"Yongwei Huang, Sergiy A. Vorobyov","The worst-case robust adaptive beamforming problem for general-rank signal model is considered. Its formulation is to maximize the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), incorporating a positive semidefinite constraint on the actual covariance matrix of the desired signal. In the literature, semidefinite program (SDP) techniques, together with others, have been applied to approximately solve this problem. Herein an inner second-order cone program (SOCP) approximate algorithm is proposed to solve it. In particular, a sequence of SOCPs are constructed and solved, while the SOCPs have the nondecreasing optimal values and converge to a locally optimal value (it is in fact a globally optimal value through our extensive simulations). As a result, our algorithm does not use computationally heavy SDP relaxation technique. To validate our inner approximation results, simulation examples are presented, and they demonstrate the improved performance of the new robust beamformer in terms of the averaged cpu-time (indicating how fast the algorithms converge) in a high signal-to-noise region.",2018-05-12T05:18:35Z,2018-05-12T05:18:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04656v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04656v1,eess.SP
Vandermonde Factorization of Hankel Matrix for Complex Exponential   Signal Recovery -- Application in Fast NMR Spectroscopy,"Jiaxi Ying, Jian-Feng Cai, Di Guo, Gongguo Tang, Zhong Chen, Xiaobo Qu","Many signals are modeled as a superposition of exponential functions in spectroscopy of chemistry, biology and medical imaging. This paper studies the problem of recovering exponential signals from a random subset of samples. We exploit the Vandermonde structure of the Hankel matrix formed by the exponential signal and formulate signal recovery as Hankel matrix completion with Vandermonde factorization (HVaF). A numerical algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model and its sequence convergence is analyzed theoretically. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that HVaF succeeds over a wider regime than the state-of-the-art nuclear-normminimization-based Hankel matrix completion method, while has a less restriction on frequency separation than the state-of-the-art atomic norm minimization and fast iterative hard thresholding methods. The effectiveness of HVaF is further validated on biological magnetic resonance spectroscopy data.",2018-09-04T00:24:14Z,2018-09-04T00:24:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00750v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00750v1,eess.SP
Graph Variogram: A novel tool to measure spatial stationarity,"Alexander Serrano, Benjamin Girault, Antonio Ortega","Irregularly sampling a spatially stationary random field does not yield a graph stationary signal in general. Based on this observation, we build a definition of graph stationarity based on intrinsic stationarity, a less restrictive definition of classical stationarity. We introduce the concept of graph variogram, a novel tool for measuring spatial intrinsic stationarity at local and global scales for irregularly sampled signals by selecting subgraphs of local neighborhoods. Graph variograms are extensions of variograms used for signals defined on continuous Euclidean space. Our experiments with intrinsically stationary signals sampled on a graph, demonstrate that graph variograms yield estimates with small bias of true theoretical models, while being robust to sampling variation of the space.",2018-09-25T06:49:35Z,2018-09-25T06:49:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09342v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09342v1,eess.SP
One-Bit MUSIC,"Xiaodong Huang, Bin Liao","In this letter, we consider the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation with one-bit quantized array measurements. With analysis, it is shown that, under mild conditions the one-bit covariance matrix can be approximated by the sum of a scaled unquantized covariance matrix and a scaled identity matrix. Although the scaling parameters unknown because of the extreme quantization, they do not affect the subspace-based DOA estimators. Specifically, the signal and noise subspaces can be straightforwardly determined through the eigendecomposition of the one-bit covariance matrix, without pre-processing such as unquantized covariance matrix reconstruction. With so-obtained subspaces, the most classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) technique can be applied to determine the signal DOAs. The resulting method is thus termed as one-bit MUSIC. Thanks to the simplicity of this method, it can be very easily implemented in practical applications, whereas the DOA estimation performance is comparable to the case with unquantized covariance matrix reconstruction, as demonstrated by various simulations.",2019-01-16T02:06:53Z,2019-01-16T02:06:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05109v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05109v1,eess.SP

Vehicle Classification Based on Seismic Signatures with Weighted   Intrinsic Mode Functions,Guozheng Jin,"Seismic signal is used for vehicle classification widely. However, this task becomes difficult as a result of various noises. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel de-noising algorithm which evolves from a nonparametric adaptive tool named empirical mode decomposition (EMD). EMD can decompose signals into a set of zero-mean modes called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that can be used to denoise a signal. Unlike other EMD-based de-noising techniques, selecting the noise-free modes to denoise signals, this paper assigns appropriate weights to the modes. In addition, considering the similarities between speech recognition and seismic vehicle classification, an algorithm scheme, consisting of improved Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and artificial neural network, is applied to recognize seismic signals for vehicle targets. The data from DARPA's SensIt project, which contains various seismic signatures from two different vehicle types, is used to evaluate the method. Through experiments, results demonstrate the efficacy of proposed algorithm as compared to traditional MFCC.",2019-02-24T09:15:37Z,2020-02-21T06:47:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09981v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09981v2,eess.SP
Channel Protection using Random Modulation,"Ali Ahmed, Humera Hameed","This paper shows that modulation protects a bandlimited signal against convolutive interference. A signal $s(t)$, bandlimited to $B$Hz, is modulated (pointwise multiplied) with a known random sign sequence $r(t)$, alternating at a rate $Q$, and the resultant \textit{spread spectrum} signal $s(t) \odot r(t)$ is convolved against an $M$-tap channel impulse response $h(t)$ to yield the observed signal $y(t)= (s(t)\odot r(t))\circledast h(t),$ where $\odot$ and $\circledast$ denote pointwise multiplication, and circular convolution, respectively.   We show that both $s(t)$, and $h(t)$ can be provably recovered using a simple gradient descent scheme by alternating the binary waveform $r(t)$ at a rate $Q \gtrsim B + M$(to within log factors and a signal coherences) and sampling $y(t)$ at a rate $Q$.

Multi-channel Time-Varying Covariance Matrix Model for Late   Reverberation Reduction,Masahito Togami,"In this paper, a multi-channel time-varying covariance matrix model for late reverberation reduction is proposed. Reflecting that variance of the late reverberation is time-varying and it depends on past speech source variance, the proposed model is defined as convolution of a speech source variance with a multi-channel time-invariant covariance matrix of late reverberation. The multi-channel time-invariant covariance matrix can be interpreted as a covariance matrix of a multi-channel acoustic transfer function (ATF). An advantageous point of the covariance matrix model against a deterministic ATF model is that the covariance matrix model is robust against fluctuation of the ATF. We propose two covariance matrix models. The first model is a covariance matrix model of late reverberation in the original microphone input signal. The second one is a covariance matrix model of late reverberation in an extended microphone input signal which includes not only current microphone input signal but also past microphone input signal. The second one considers correlation between the current microphone input signal and the past microphone input signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively reduces reverberation especially in a time-varying ATF scenario and the second model is shown to be more effective than the first model.",2019-10-19T06:15:29Z,2019-10-19T06:15:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08710v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08710v1,eess.AS
Frequency Diverse Array Radar: New Results and Discrete Fourier   Transform Based Beampattern,"Muhammad Zubair, Sajid Ahmed, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","In the phased-array radar (PAR) signals from each antenna are transmitted at the same carrier frequency, which yields narrowly focused only angle dependent beampattern. In contrast, in the frequency-diverse-array (FDA) radar signals from antenna array are generally transmitted at linearly increasing frequencies that yields range, time, and angle dependent beampattern. Reported literature on FDA radar missed the contribution of path-differences in the signal model due to the antenna array elements, which may lead to misleading results. In this work, incorporating missed path-differences, the signal model of FDA radar is corrected. Using the corrected signal model, it is shown that the instantaneous beampattern depends on the number of transmit antenna and average beampattern depends on the product of frequency-offset and pulse-duration. Moreover, to illuminate the desired region-of-interest for longer dwell time, discrete-Fourier-transform based low-complexity algorithm is proposed. In contrast to the conventional FDA radar's 'S' shaped beampattern, the beampattern of the proposed algorithm changes linearly with range.

Robust and Low Complexity Beam Tracking with Monopulse Signal for UAV   Communications,"Ha-Lim Song, Young-Chai Ko","UAV communications based on an antenna array entail a beam tracking technology for reliable link acquisition. Unlike conventional cellular communication, beam tracking in UAV communication addresses new issues such as mobility and abrupt channel disconnection from UAV's perturbation. To deal with these issues, we propose a beam tracking scheme based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) using a monopulse signal, which can provide (1) higher robustness by offering a reliable link in the estimated spatial direction and (2) lower complexity compared with the existing conventional beam tracking schemes. We point out the limitations of using a beamformed signal as a measurement model for a Kalman filter (KF) based scheme and instead utilize the monopulse signal as a more plausible model. For the performance evaluation, we derive the upper bound of the mean square error for spatial angle estimation of UAV and confirm that the proposed scheme is stable with a certain bounded error. We also show from various simulations that the proposed scheme can efficiently track UAV and detect beam disconnection every time frame using a beamformed signal.",2020-07-02T10:42:52Z,2021-03-15T01:17:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01006v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01006v4,eess.SP

Given the considerable literature regarding the resilience of infrastructure networks using graph theory, it is not surprising that a number of applications of GSP can be found in the resilience domain. GSP techniques assume that the choice of graphical Fourier transform (GFT) imparts a particular spectral structure on the signal of interest. We assess a number of power distribution systems with respect to metrics of signal structure and identify several correlates to system properties and further demonstrate how these metrics relate to performance of some GSP techniques. We also discuss the feasibility of a data-driven approach that improves these metrics and apply it to a water distribution scenario. Overall, we find that many of the candidate systems analyzed are properly structured in the chosen GFT basis and amenable to GSP techniques, but identify considerable variability and nuance that merits future investigation.",2020-07-21T17:31:18Z,2020-07-21T17:31:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10964v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10964v1,eess.SP
Plant responses to auxin signals: an operating principle for dynamical   sensitivity yet high resilience,"Silvia Grigolon, Barbara Bravi, Olivier C.

The associated biomolecular signaling network involves a negative feedback at the level of the Aux/IAA proteins which mediate the influence of auxin (the signal) on the ARF transcription factors (the drivers of the response). To probe the role of this feedback, we consider alternative in silico signaling networks implementing different operating principles. By a comparative analysis, we find that the presence of a negative regulatory feedback loop allows the system to have a far larger sensitivity in its dynamical response to auxin. At the same time, this sensitivity does not prevent the system from being highly resilient. Given this insight, we reconsider previously published models and build a new quantitative and calibrated biomolecular model of auxin signaling.",2017-06-12T13:35:03Z,2017-06-12T13:35:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03623v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03623v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM"

These systems make use of the radio measurements of short-range commodity wireless devices, which vary due to the inhalation and exhalation motion of a person. The success of respiration rate estimation using such measurements depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, which alters with properties of the person and with the measurement system. To date, no model has been presented that allows evaluation of different deployments or system configurations for successful breathing rate estimation. In this paper, a received signal strength model for respiration rate monitoring is introduced. It is shown that measurements in linear and logarithmic scale have the same functional form, and the same estimation techniques can be used in both cases. The implications of the model are validated under varying signal-to-noise ratio conditions using the performances of three estimators: batch frequency estimator, recursive Bayesian estimator, and model-based estimator.

Grouping Similar Seismocardiographic Signals Using Respiratory   Information,"Amirtaha Taebi, Hansen A Mansy","Seismocardiography (SCG) offers a potential non-invasive method for cardiac monitoring. Quantification of the effects of different physiological conditions on SCG can lead to enhanced understanding of SCG genesis, and may explain how some cardiac pathologies may affect SCG morphology. In this study, the effect of the respiration on the SCG signal morphology is investigated. SCG, ECG, and respiratory flow rate signals were measured simultaneously in 7 healthy subjects. Results showed that SCG events tended to have two slightly different morphologies. The respiratory flow rate and lung volume information were used to group the SCG events into inspiratory/expiratory groups or low/high lung-volume groups, respectively. Although respiratory flow information could separate similar SCG events into two different groups, the lung volume information provided better grouping of similar SCGs. This suggests that variations in SCG morphology may be due, at least in part, to changes in the intrathoracic pressure or heart location since those parameters correlates more with lung volume than respiratory flow. Categorizing SCG events into different groups containing similar events allows more accurate estimation of SCG features, and better signal characterization, and classification.",2017-11-29T22:44:43Z,2017-11-29T22:44:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11140v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11140v1,eess.SP

New sufficient conditions of signal recovery with tight frames via   $l_1$-analysis,"Jianwen Huang, Jianjun Wang, Feng Zhang, Wendong Wang","The paper discusses the recovery of signals in the case that signals are nearly sparse with respect to a tight frame $D$ by means of the $l_1$-analysis approach. We establish several new sufficient conditions regarding the $D$-restricted isometry property to ensure stable reconstruction of signals that are approximately sparse with respect to $D$. It is shown that if the measurement matrix $\Phi$ fulfils the condition $\delta_{ts}<t/(4-t)$ for $0<t<4/3$, then signals which are approximately sparse with respect to $D$ can be stably recovered by the $l_1$-analysis method. In the case of $D=I$, the bound is sharp, see Cai and Zhang's work \cite{Cai and Zhang 2014}. When $t=1$, the present bound improves the condition $\delta_s<0.307$ from Lin et al.'s reuslt to $\delta_s<1/3$.",2017-10-30T12:33:19Z,2017-10-30T12:33:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11124v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11124v1,eess.SP
Dynamic regulation of T cell activation by coupled feedforward loops,"Gershom Buri, Girma Mesfin Zelleke, Wilfred Ndifon","The adaptive immune system responds to foreign invaders by activating T cells. However, this response is perilous if T cells are activated by the wrong signal or if they remain activated unduly long after the threat has been eliminated. It is therefore important that T cells get activated only by the right kind of signals and for the right duration. The dominant theory in immunology over recent decades has been that a T cell must receive at least two signals before it can become activated. It is, however, unclear whether and how this two-signal requirement ensures that T cell activation is provoked only by the right signals and that the response is just long enough. Here, we propose that the two signal requirement induces a novel coherent feedforward motif whose properties align with those preferred for an ideal immune response. Further consideration of the interaction between helper and regulatory T cells induces a composite feedforward-feedback motif, analysis of which generates a condition for a healthy concentration of activated T helper cells.",2017-12-01T14:20:21Z,2017-12-01T14:20:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00330v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00330v1,"q-bio.PE, q-bio.CB, q-bio.MN"
Blind Identification of SFBC-OFDM Signals Using Subspace Decompositions   and Random Matrix Theory,"Mingjun Gao, Yongzhao Li, Octavia A. Dobre, Naofal Al-Dhahir","Blind signal identification has important applications in both civilian and military communications. Previous investigations on blind identification of space-frequency block codes (SFBCs) only considered identifying Alamouti and spatial multiplexing transmission schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to identify SFBCs by analyzing discriminating features for different SFBCs, calculated by separating the signal subspace and noise subspace of the received signals at different adjacent OFDM subcarriers. Relying on random matrix theory, this algorithm utilizes a serial hypothesis test to determine the decision boundary according to the maximum eigenvalue in the noise subspace. Then, a decision tree of a special distance metric is employed for decision making. The proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the signal parameters such as the number of transmit antennas, channel coefficients, modulation mode and noise power. Simulation results verify the viability of the proposed algorithm for a reduced observation period with an acceptable computational complexity.",2018-03-13T21:22:41Z,2019-08-14T17:46:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05053v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05053v2,eess.SP
A Generalized Signal Quality Estimation Method for IoT Sensors,"Arlene John, Barry Cardiff, Deepu John","IoT wearable devices are widely expected to reduce the cost and risk of personal healthcare. However, ambulatory data collected from such devices are often corrupted or contaminated with severe noises. Signal Quality Indicators (SQIs) can be used to assess the quality of data obtained from wearable devices, such that transmission/ storage of unusable data can be prevented. This article introduces a novel and generalized SQI which can be implemented on an edge device for detecting the quality of any quasi-periodic signal under observation, regardless of the type of noise present. The application of this SQI on Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is investigated. From the analysis carried out, it was found that the proposed generalized SQI is suitable for quality assessment of ECG signals and exhibits a linear behavior in the medium to high SNR regions under all noise conditions considered. The proposed SQI was used for acceptability testing of ECG records in CinC Physionet 2011 challenge dataset and found to be accurate for 90.4% of the records while having minimal computational complexity.",2020-02-04T13:38:32Z,2020-02-04T13:38:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01279v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01279v1,eess.SP
Delineation and Analysis of Seismocardiographic Systole and Diastole   Profiles,"Tilendra Choudhary, M. K. Bhuyan, L. N.

Delineation techniques proposed in the existing literature do not estimate all the clinically significant points of an SCG signal, simultaneously. The aim of this research work is to propose a delineation framework to identify IM, AO, IC, AC, pAC and MO fiducial points with the help of a PPG signal. The proposed delineation method processes a wavelet-based scalographic PPG and an envelope construction scheme is proposed to estimate the prominent peaks of the PPG signal. A set of amplitude histogram based decision rules is developed for estimation of SCG diastole phases, namely AC, pAC and MO. Subsequently, the systolic phases, IM, AO and IC are detected by applying diastole masking on SCG and decision rules. Experimental results on real-time SCG signals acquired from our designed data acquisition-circuitry and their analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Additionally, these estimated parameters are analyzed to show the discrimination between normal breathing and breathlessness conditions.",2020-02-24T17:49:42Z,2020-02-24T17:49:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10405v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10405v1,eess.SP
Using Cyclic Noise as the Source Signal for Neural Source-Filter-based   Speech Waveform Model,"Xin Wang, Junichi Yamagishi","Neural source-filter (NSF) waveform models generate speech waveforms by morphing sine-based source signals through dilated convolution in the time domain. Although the sine-based source signals help the NSF models to produce voiced sounds with specified pitch, the sine shape may constrain the generated waveform when the target voiced sounds are less periodic. In this paper, we propose a more flexible source signal called cyclic noise, a quasi-periodic noise sequence given by the convolution of a pulse train and a static random noise with a trainable decaying rate that controls the signal shape. We further propose a masked spectral loss to guide the NSF models to produce periodic voiced sounds from the cyclic noise-based source signal. Results from a large-scale listening test demonstrated the effectiveness of the cyclic noise and the masked spectral loss on speaker-independent NSF models in copy-synthesis experiments on the CMU ARCTIC database.",2020-04-05T13:00:56Z,2020-04-10T14:48:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02191v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02191v2,eess.AS
Signal processing on simplicial complexes,"Feng Ji, Giacomo Kahn, Wee Peng Tay","Theoretical development and applications of graph signal processing (GSP) have attracted much attention.

A graph is a combinatorial object that models binary relations, and it does not directly model complex n-ary relations. One possible high dimensional generalization of graphs are simplicial complexes. They are a step between the constrained case of graphs and the general case of hypergraphs. In this paper, we develop a signal processing framework on simplicial complexes, such that we recover the traditional GSP theory when restricted to signals on graphs. It is worth mentioning that the framework works much more generally, though the focus of the paper is on simplicial complexes.

Nevertheless, the frequency range of the radars usually overlaps with other existed radio-frequency (RF) applications, and only a centimeter-level imaging resolution has been reported, making them insufficient for civilian applications. Here, we propose a microwave photonic imaging radar with a millimeter-level resolution by introducing a frequency-stepped chirp signal based on an optical frequency shifting loop. As compared with the conventional linear-frequency modulated (LFM) signal, the frequency-stepped chirp signal can bring the system excellent capability of anti-interference. In an experiment, a frequency-stepped chirp signal with a total bandwidth of 18.2 GHz (16.9 to 35.1 GHz) is generated. Postprocessing the radar echo, radar imaging with a two-dimensional imaging resolution of ~8.5 mm$\times$~8.3 mm is achieved.

The proposed relative positioning system (RPS) explores the signal properties over a large spectrum of frequency bands, and derives a vehicle tracking algorithm to accurately estimate the vehicle's trajectory in space and time using an arbitrary set of unknown reference positions.

Low-Complexity Vector Quantized Compressed Sensing via Deep Neural   Networks,"Markus Leinonen, Marian Codreanu","Sparse signals, encountered in many wireless and signal acquisition applications, can be acquired via compressed sensing (CS) to reduce computations and transmissions, crucial for resource-limited devices, e.g., wireless sensors. Since the information signals are often continuous-valued, digital communication of compressive measurements requires quantization. In such a quantized compressed sensing (QCS) context, we address remote acquisition of a sparse source through vector quantized noisy compressive measurements. We propose a deep encoder-decoder architecture, consisting of an encoder deep neural network (DNN), a quantizer, and a decoder DNN, that realizes low-complexity vector quantization aiming at minimizing the mean-square error of the signal reconstruction for a given quantization rate. We devise a supervised learning method using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation to train the system blocks. Strategies to overcome the vanishing gradient problem are proposed.

Deep Learning-based Modulation Detection for NOMA Systems,"Wenwu Xie, Jian Xiao, Jinxia Yang, Xin Peng, Chao Yu, Peng Zhu","Since the signal with strong power should be demodulated first for successive interference cancellation (SIC) demodulation in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, the base station (BS) should inform the near user terminal (UT), which has allocated higher power, of modulation mode of the far user terminal. To avoid unnecessary signaling overhead in this process, a blind detection algorithm of NOMA signal modulation mode is designed in this paper. Taking the joint constellation density diagrams of NOMA signal as the detection features, deep residual network is built for classification, so as to detect the modulation mode of NOMA signal. In view of the fact that the joint constellation diagrams are easily polluted by high intensity noise and lose their real distribution pattern, the wavelet denoising method is adopted to improve the quality of constellations. The simulation results represent that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory detection accuracy in NOMA systems. In addition, the factors affecting the recognition performance are also verified and analyzed.",2020-05-24T08:22:18Z,2020-10-16T13:24:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11684v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11684v2,eess.SP

By taking advantage of arbitrary communication signals occurring in the scenario, we apply direct processing to the output signal from the LIS to obtain a radio map that describes the physical presence of passive devices (scatterers, humans) which act as virtual sources due to the communication signal reflections. We then assess the usage of machine learning (k-means clustering), image processing and computer vision (template matching and component labeling) to extract meaningful information from these radio maps. As an exemplary use case, we evaluate this method for both active and passive user detection in an indoor setting.

Blind Channel Estimation for MIMO Systems via Variational Inference,"Jiancheng Tang, Qianqian Yang, Zhaoyang Zhang","In this paper, we investigate the blind channel estimation problem for MIMO systems under Rayleigh fading channel. Conventional MIMO communication techniques require transmitting a considerable amount of training symbols as pilots in each data block to obtain the channel state information (CSI) such that the transmitted signals can be successfully recovered. However, the pilot overhead and contamination become a bottleneck for the practical application of MIMO systems with the increase of the number of antennas. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a blind channel estimation framework, where we introduce an auxiliary posterior distribution of CSI and the transmitted signals given the received signals to derive a lower bound to the intractable likelihood function of the received signal. Meanwhile, we generate this auxiliary distribution by a neural network based variational inference framework, which is trained by maximizing the lower bound. The optimal auxiliary distribution which approaches real prior distribution is then leveraged to obtain the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation of channel matrix and transmitted data.

Half-infinite sampling and its FT,Rui Li,"In the digital world, signals are discrete and finite. The Fourier representation of discrete and finite signals is FT convolution of the finite sampling function and the continuous signal. Conventionally, finite sampling is treated as a segment of infinite sampling. Though this approach perfectly solves the difference between finite and infinite sampling, it has caused much trouble for signal processing. Mathematically, there is a kind of sampling between finite and infinite sampling, and we name this kind of sampling as half-infinite sampling. Theoretically, finite sampling can also be treated as a segment of half-infinite sampling. Because we can derive the Fourier representation of discrete and finite signals from half-infinite sampling, the FTs of several half-infinite samplings are studied. The results show that the FT of half-infinite sampling is more concise than that of infinite sampling.

Nevertheless, theoretical analysis for BOLS utilizes the block-MIP to deal with the block sparsity. Furthermore, the noiseless MIP-based analyses are extended to the noisy scenario. Our results indicate that for K-sparse signals, when MIP or SNR satisfies certain conditions, OLS and MOLS obtain reliable reconstruction in at most K iterations, while BOLS succeeds in at most (K/d) iterations where d is the block length.

A Fast Algorithm for Selective Signal Extrapolation with Arbitrary Basis   Functions,"J√ºrgen Seiler, Andr√© Kaup","Signal extrapolation is an important task in digital signal processing for extending known signals into unknown areas. The Selective Extrapolation is a very effective algorithm to achieve this. Thereby, the extrapolation is obtained by generating a model of the signal to be extrapolated as weighted superposition of basis functions. Unfortunately, this algorithm is computationally very expensive and, up to now, efficient implementations exist only for basis function sets that emanate from discrete transforms. Within the scope of this contribution, a novel efficient solution for Selective Extrapolation is presented for utilization with arbitrary basis functions.

In silico evolution of signaling networks using rule-based models:   bistable response dynamics,"Song Feng, Orkun S. Soyer","One of the ultimate goals in biology is to understand the design principles of biological systems. Such principles, if they exist, can help us better understand complex, natural biological systems and guide the engineering of de novo ones. Towards deciphering design principles, in silico evolution of biological systems with proper abstraction is a promising approach. Here, we demonstrate the application of in silico evolution combined with rule-based modelling for exploring design principles of cellular signaling networks. This application is based on a computational platform, called BioJazz, which allows in silico evolution of signaling networks with unbounded complexity. We provide a detailed introduction to BioJazz architecture and implementation and describe how it can be used to evolve and/or design signaling networks with defined dynamics. For the latter, we evolve signaling networks with switch-like response dynamics and demonstrate how BioJazz can result in new biological insights on network structures that can endow bistable response dynamics. This example also demonstrated both the power of BioJazz in evolving and designing signaling networks and its limitations at the current stage of development.",2018-02-01T19:23:44Z,2018-02-06T17:08:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00462v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00462v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM, q-bio.SC"
A Spectral Method for Stable Bispectrum Inversion with Application to   Multireference Alignment,"Hua Chen, Mona Zehni, Zhizhen Zhao","We focus on an alignment-free method to estimate the underlying signal from a large number of noisy randomly shifted observations. Specifically, we estimate the mean, power spectrum, and bispectrum of the signal from the observations. Since bispectrum contains the phase information of the signal, reliable algorithms for bispectrum inversion is useful in many applications. We propose a new algorithm using spectral decomposition of the normalized bispectrum matrix for this task. For clean signals, we show that the eigenvectors of the normalized bispectrum matrix correspond to the true phases of the signal and its shifted copies. In addition, the spectral method is robust to noise. It can be used as a stable and efficient initialization technique for local non-convex optimization for bispectrum inversion.",2018-02-28T16:00:20Z,2018-02-28T16:00:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10493v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10493v1,eess.SP
A Novel Scheme for Support Identification and Iterative Sampling of   Bandlimited Graph Signals,"Abolfazl Hashemi, Rasoul Shafipour, Haris Vikalo, Gonzalo Mateos","We study the problem of sampling and reconstruction of bandlimited graph signals where the objective is to select a node subset of prescribed cardinality that ensures interpolation of the original signal with the lowest reconstruction error. We propose an efficient iterative selection sampling approach and show that in the noiseless case the original signal is exactly recovered from the set of selected nodes. In the case of noisy measurements, a bound on the reconstruction error of the proposed algorithm is established. We further address the support identification of the bandlimited signal with unknown support and show that under a pragmatic sufficient condition, the proposed framework requires minimal number of samples to perfectly identify the support. The efficacy of the proposed methods are illustrated through numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world graphs.",2018-07-18T23:28:25Z,2018-07-18T23:28:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07184v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07184v1,eess.SP

Information-theoretic analysis of multivariate single - cell signaling   responses using SLEMI,"Tomasz Jetka, Tomasz Winarski, Karol Nienaltowski, Slawomir Blonski, Michal Komorowski","Mathematical methods of information theory constitute essential tools to describe how stimuli are encoded in activities of signaling effectors. Exploring the information-theoretic perspective, however, remains conceptually, experimentally and computationally challenging. Specifically, existing computational tools enable efficient analysis of relatively simple systems, usually with one input and output only. Moreover, their robust and readily applicable implementations are missing. Here, we propose a novel algorithm to analyze signaling data within the framework of information theory. Our approach enables robust as well as statistically and computationally efficient analysis of signaling systems with high-dimensional outputs and a large number of input values. Analysis of the NF-kB single - cell signaling responses to TNF-a uniquely reveals that the NF-kB signaling dynamics improves discrimination of high concentrations of TNF-a with a modest impact on discrimination of low concentrations.

Graphon Filters: Graph Signal Processing in the Limit,"Matthew W. Morency, Geert Leus","Graph signal processing is an emerging field which aims to model processes that exist on the nodes of a network and are explained through diffusion over this structure. Graph signal processing works have heretofore assumed knowledge of the graph shift operator. Our approach is to investigate the question of graph filtering on a graph about which we only know a model. To do this we leverage the theory of graphons proposed by L. Lovasz and B. Szegedy. We make three key contributions to the emerging field of graph signal processing. We show first that filters defined over the scaled adjacency matrix of a random graph drawn from a graphon converge to filters defined over the Fredholm integral operator with the graphon as its kernel. Second, leveraging classical findings from the theory of the numerical solution of Fredholm integral equations, we define the Fourier-Galerkin shift operator. Lastly, using the Fourier-Galerkin shift operator, we derive a graph filter design algorithm which only depends on the graphon, and thus depends only on the probabilistic structure of the graph instead of the particular graph itself. The derived graphon filtering algorithm is verified through simulations on a variety of random graph models.",2020-03-04T14:32:01Z,2020-03-04T14:32:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02099v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02099v1,eess.SP
Neural Network-Optimized Channel Estimator and Training Signal Design   for MIMO Systems with Few-Bit ADCs,Duy H. N.

In these systems, a linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimator obtained in closed-form is not an optimal solution. We first consider a deep neural network (DNN) and train it as a non-linear MMSE channel estimator for few-bit MIMO systems. We then present a first attempt to use DNN in optimizing the training signal and the MMSE channel estimator concurrently. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder with a specialized first layer, whose weights embed the training signal matrix. Consequently, the trained autoencoder prompts a new training signal design that is customized for the MIMO channel model under consideration.",2020-03-19T20:14:21Z,2020-09-01T17:18:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09007v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09007v3,eess.SP

Despite the limiting effect of such input-noise impairments on signal processing systems, they are routinely ignored in the literature. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for data detection and signal estimation, referred to as Approximate Message Passing with Input noise (AMPI), which takes into account input-noise impairments. To demonstrate the efficacy of AMPI, we investigate two applications: Data detection in large multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) wireless systems and sparse signal recovery in compressive sensing. For both applications, we provide precise conditions in the large-system limit for which AMPI achieves optimal performance. We furthermore use simulations to demonstrate that AMPI achieves near-optimal performance at low complexity in realistic, finite-dimensional systems.",2020-08-05T19:55:33Z,2020-08-05T19:55:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02337v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02337v1,eess.SP
Signal Separation Using a Mathematical Model of Physiological Signals   for the Measurement of Heart Pulse Wave Propagation With Array Radar,Takuya Sakamoto,"The arterial pulse wave, which propagates along the artery, is an important indicator of various cardiovascular diseases. By measuring the displacement at multiple parts of the human body, pulse wave velocity can be estimated from the pulse transit time. This paper proposes a technique for signal separation using an antenna array, so that pulse wave propagation can be measured in a non-contact manner. The body displacements due to the pulse wave at different body parts are highly correlated, and cannot be accurately separated using techniques that assume independent or uncorrelated signals. The proposed method formulates the signal separation as an optimization problem, based on a mathematical model of the arterial pulse wave. The objective function in the optimization comprises four terms that are derived based on a small-displacement approximation, unimodal impulse response approximation, and a causality condition. The optimization process was implemented using a genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments.",2020-08-20T13:09:25Z,2020-09-25T04:21:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08948v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08948v2,eess.SP
Denoising Click-evoked Otoacoustic Emission Signals by Optimal Shrinkage,"Tzu-Chi Liu, Yi-Wen Liu, Hau-Tieng Wu","Click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs) are clinically used as an objective way to infer whether cochlear functions are normal. However, because the sound pressure level of CEOAEs is typically much lower than the background noise, it usually takes hundreds, if not thousands of repetitions to estimate the signal with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of CEOAE signals within limited measurement time by optimal shrinkage (OS) in two different settings: the covariance-based OS (cOS) and the singular value decomposition (SVD)-based OS (sOS). By simulation and analyzing human CEOAE data, the cOS consistently reduced the noise and enhanced the SNR by 1 to 2 dB from a baseline method (BM) that is based on calculating the median. The sOS achieved an SNR enhancement of 2 to 3 dB in simulation, and demonstrated capability to enhance the SNR in real recordings when the SNR achieved by the BM was below 0 dB. An appealing property of OS is that it produces an estimate of every individual column of the signal matrix. This property makes it possible to investigate CEOAE dynamics across a longer period of time when the cochlear conditions are not strictly stationary.",2020-09-01T12:35:14Z,2020-09-01T12:35:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00386v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00386v1,eess.SP
A Novel Ridge Detector for Nonstationary Multicomponent Signals:   Development and Application to Robust Mode Retrieval,"Nils Laurent, Sylvain Meignen","Time-frequency analysis is often used to study non stationary multicomponent signals, which can be viewed as the surperimposition of modes, associated with ridges in the TF plane. To understand such signals, it is essential to identify their constituent modes. This is often done by performing ridge detection in the time-frequency plane which is then followed by mode retrieval. Unfortunately, existing ridge detectors are often not enough robust to noise therefore hampering mode retrieval. In this paper, we therefore develop a novel approach to ridge detection and mode retrieval based on the analysis of the short-time Fourier transform of multicomponent signals in the presence of noise, which will prove to be much more robust than state-of-the-art methods based on the same time-frequency representation.",2020-09-28T08:08:15Z,2022-04-05T09:27:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13123v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13123v2,eess.SP
Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation by Short-Length Probabilistic   Constellation Shaping for Pilot-Aided Signaling,"Tobias Fehenberger, Helmut Griesser, J√∂rg-Peter Elbers","Probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) offers a significant performance improvement over uniform signaling. It was recently discovered that long blocks are not required to achieve maximum shaping gain when transmitting over the nonlinear fiber channel because short-length PCS effectively mitigates fiber nonlinear interference (NLI). The reason for this behavior is that short-length PCS implicitly induces some temporal properties in the shaped transmit sequence that are beneficial for the fiber-optic channel. To achieve robust data-aided digital signal processing of high-order QAM, periodic quaternary phase shift keying pilots are typically inserted into the high-order QAM transmit sequence. In this work, we investigate in simulations the effect of such pilot-aided signaling on NLI mitigation. Albeit modifying the temporal properties of the shaped transmit sequence, a pilot rate of 1/32 is found to not alter the beneficial effects of short-length PCS. The operation meaning of this finding is that even with pilot-aided signaling, long PCS block lengths are not required for maximum shaping gain.",2020-12-14T10:18:21Z,2020-12-14T10:18:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07388v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07388v1,eess.SP

Meanwhile, it has been recently admitted that implementing artificial intelligence (AI) into RIS communications will extensively benefit the reconfiguration capacity and enhance the robustness to complicated transmission environments. Besides the conventional model-driven approaches, AI can also deal with the existing signal processing problems in a data-driven manner via digging the inherent characteristic from the real data. Hence, AI is particularly suitable for the signal processing problems over RIS networks under unideal scenarios like modeling mismatching, insufficient resource, hardware impairment, as well as dynamical transmissions.

The surface electromyography (sEMG) signals have been widely used to provide information about muscle activities including detecting muscle fatigue by various data-driven techniques such as machine learning and statistical approaches. However, it is well-known that sEMG signals are weak signals (low amplitude of the signals) with a low signal-to-noise ratio, data-driven techniques cannot work well when the quality of the data is poor. In particular, the existing methods are unable to detect muscle fatigue coming from static poses. This work exploits the concept of weak monotonicity, which has been observed in the process of fatigue, to robustly detect muscle fatigue in the presence of measurement noises and human variations. Such a population trend methodology has shown its potential in muscle fatigue detection as demonstrated by the experiment of a static pose.",2021-06-18T13:03:14Z,2021-06-18T13:03:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10109v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10109v1,"eess.SP, q-bio.TO"
Learning to Sample: Data-Driven Sampling and Reconstruction of FRI   Signals,"Satish Mulleti, Haiyang Zhang, Yonina C.

Due to their finite degrees of freedom, FRI signals can be sampled at sub-Nyquist rates using appropriate sampling kernels and reconstructed using sparse-recovery algorithms. Typically, Fourier samples of the FRI signals are used for reconstruction. The reconstruction quality depends on the choice of Fourier samples and recovery method. In this paper, we consider to jointly optimize the choice of Fourier samples and reconstruction parameters. Our framework is a combination of a greedy subsampling algorithm and a learning-based sparse recovery method. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed algorithm can flexibly handle changes in the sampling rate and does not suffer from differentiability issues during training. Importantly, exact knowledge of the FRI pulse is not required. Numerical results show that, for a given number of samples, the proposed joint design leads to lower reconstruction error for FRI signals compared to independent data-driven design methods for both noisy and clean samples. Our learning to sample approach can be readily applied to other sampling setups as well including compressed sensing problems.",2021-06-28T09:28:58Z,2021-06-30T19:59:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14500v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14500v2,eess.SP
Mixed-Spectrum Signals -- Discrete Approximations and Variance   Expressions for Covariance Estimates,"Filip Elvander, Johan Karlsson","The estimation of the covariance function of a stochastic process, or signal, is of integral importance for a multitude of signal processing applications. In this work, we derive closed-form expressions for the variance of covariance estimates for mixed-spectrum signals, i.e., spectra containing both absolutely continuous and singular parts. The results cover both finite-sample and asymptotic regimes, allowing for assessing the exact speed of convergence of estimates to their expectations, as well as their limiting behavior. As is shown, such covariance estimates may converge even for non-ergodic processes. Furthermore, we consider approximating signals with arbitrary spectral densities by sequences of singular spectrum, i.e., sinusoidal, processes, and derive the limiting behavior of covariance estimates as both the sample size and the number of sinusoidal components tend to infinity. We show that the asymptotic regime variance can be described by a time-frequency resolution product, with dramatically different behavior depending on how the sinusoidal approximation is constructed. In a few numerical examples we illustrate the theory and the corresponding implications for direction of arrival estimation.",2021-06-28T13:19:37Z,2021-10-04T10:20:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14696v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14696v2,eess.SP
"Signaling receptor localization maximizes cellular information   acquisition in spatially-structured, natural environments","Zitong Jerry Wang, Matt Thomson","Cells in natural environments like tissue or soil sense and respond to extracellular ligands with intricately structured and non-monotonic spatial distributions that are sculpted by processes such as fluid flow and substrate adhesion. Nevertheless, traditional approaches to studying cell sensing assume signals are either uniform or monotonic, neglecting spatial structures of natural environments. In this work, we show that spatial sensing and navigation can be optimized by adapting the spatial organization of signaling pathways to the spatial structure of the environment. By viewing cell surface receptors as a sensor network, we develop an information theoretic framework for computing the optimal spatial organization of a sensing system for a given spatial signaling environment. Applying the framework to simulated environments, we find that spatial receptor localization maximizes information acquisition in many natural contexts, including tissue and soil. Receptor localization extends naturally to produce a dynamic protocol for redistributing signaling receptors during cell navigation and can be implemented in a cell using a feedback scheme. In a simulated tissue environment, dynamic receptor localization boosts navigation efficiency by 30-fold. Broadly, our framework readily adapts to studying how the spatial organization of signaling components other than receptors can be modulated to improve cellular information processing.",2021-07-02T02:45:08Z,2021-07-02T02:45:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00806v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00806v1,q-bio.CB

Transmit waveform and receive beamforming are jointly designed to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radar under the security and power budget constraints. We apply a Directional Modulation (DM) approach to exploit constructive interference (CI), where the known multiuser interference (MUI) can be exploited as a source of useful signal.

The proposed multi-lead fusion method accurately delineates the QRS complex by the fusion of detected QRS complexes of the individual 12 leads. The proposed algorithm consists of two major stages. Firstly, the QRS complex location of each lead is detected by the single lead QRS detection algorithm. Secondly, the multi-lead fusion algorithm combines the information of the QRS complex locations obtained in each of the 12 leads.

Most of the current researches focus on supervised learning. However, in many real scenarios, it is difficult and cost to obtain the labels of signals. In this letter, we turn to the more challenging problem: can we cluster the modulation types just based on a large number of unlabeled radio signals? If this problem can be solved, we then can also recognize modulation types by manually labeling a very small number of samples. To answer this problem, we propose a deep transfer clustering (DTC) model. DTC naturally integrates feature learning and deep clustering, and further adopts a transfer learning mechanism to improve the feature extraction ability of an embedded convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

Residual Recovery Algorithm For Modulo Sampling,"Eyar Azar, Satish Mulleti, Yonina C. Eldar","Two important attributes of analog to digital converters (ADCs) are its sampling rate and dynamic range. The sampling rate should be greater than or equal to the Nyquist rate for bandlimited signals with bounded energy. It is also desired that the signals' dynamic range should be within that of the ADC's; otherwise, the signal will be clipped. A modulo operator has been recently suggested prior to sampling to restrict the dynamic range. Due to the nonlinearity of the modulo operation, the samples are distorted. Existing recovery algorithms to recover the signal from its modulo samples operate at a high sampling rate and are not robust in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to recover the signal from the modulo samples which operates at lower sampling rate compared to existing techniques. We also show that our method has lower error compared to existing approaches for a given sampling rate, noise level, and dynamic range of the ADC. Our results lead to less constrained hardware design to address dynamic range issues while operating at the lowest rate possible.",2021-10-07T11:04:15Z,2021-10-07T11:04:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03335v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03335v1,eess.SP
Unlimited Sampling Theorem Based on Fractional Fourier Transform,"Hui Zhao, Bing-Zhao Li","The recovery of bandlimited signals with high dynamic range is a hot issue in sampling research. The unlimited sampling theory expands the recordable range of traditional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) arbitrarily, and the signal is folded back into a low dynamic range measurement, avoiding the saturation problem. We study the unlimited sampling problem of high dynamic non-bandlimited signals in the Fourier domain (FD) based on the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT). First, a mathematical signal model for unlimited sampling is proposed. Then, based on this mathematical model, the annihilation filtering method is used to estimate the arbitrary folding time. Finally, a novel unlimited sampling theorem in the FRFD is obtained. The results show that the non-bandlimited signal can be reconstructed in the FD based on the FRFT, and it is not affected by the ADC threshold.",2021-10-22T10:18:02Z,2023-02-17T11:00:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13003v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13003v2,eess.SP
Finding Structure in Silence: The Role of Pauses in Aligning Speaker   Expectations,"Maja Linke, Michael Ramscar","The intelligibility of speech relies on the ability of interlocutors to dynamically align their expectations about the rates at which informative changes in signals occur. Exactly how this is achieved remains an open question. We propose that speaker alignment is supported by the statistical structure of spoken signals and show how pauses offer a time-invariant template for structuring speech sequences. Consistent with this, we show that pause distributions in conversational English and Korean provide a memoryless information source. We describe how this can facilitate both the initial structuring and maintenance of predictability in spoken signals over time, and show how the properties of this signal change predictably with speaker experience. These results indicate that pauses provide a structuring signal that interacts with the morphological and rhythmical structure of languages, allowing speakers at all stages of lifespan development to distinguish signal from noise and maintain mutual predictability in time.",2021-12-15T13:56:51Z,2022-11-02T11:21:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08126v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08126v3,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.PE"
Using Capsule Networks to Classify Digitally Modulated Signals with Raw   I/Q Data,"James A. Latshaw, Dimitrie C. Popescu, John A. Snoap, Chad M.

This paper presents the use of capsule networks for classification of digitally modulated signals using the I/Q signal components. The generalization ability of a trained capsule network to correctly classify the classes of digitally modulated signals that it has been trained to recognize is also studied by using two different datasets that contain similar classes of digitally modulated signals but that have been generated independently. Results indicate that the capsule networks are able to achieve high classification accuracy.

Synthesis of Soundfields through Irregular Loudspeaker Arrays Based on   Convolutional Neural Networks,"Luca Comanducci, Fabio Antonacci, Augusto Sarti","Most soundfield synthesis approaches deal with extensive and regular loudspeaker arrays, which are often not suitable for home audio systems, due to physical space constraints. In this article we propose a technique for soundfield synthesis through more easily deployable irregular loudspeaker arrays, i.e. where the spacing between loudspeakers is not constant, based on deep learning. The input are the driving signals obtained through a plane wave decomposition-based technique. While the considered driving signals are able to correctly reproduce the soundfield with a regular array, they show degraded performances when using irregular setups. Through a complex-valued Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) we modify the driving signals in order to compensate the errors in the reproduction of the desired soundfield. Since no ground-truth driving signals are available for the compensated ones, we train the model by calculating the loss between the desired soundfield at a number of control points and the one obtained through the driving signals estimated by the network. Numerical results show better reproduction accuracy with respect to the plane wave decomposition-based technique, pressure-matching approach and to linear optimizers for driving signal compensation.",2022-05-25T15:43:47Z,2023-09-11T06:34:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12872v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12872v3,eess.AS
Design of optical voltage sensor based on electric field regulation and   rotating isomerism electrode,"Jun Li, Yifan Lin, Nan Xie","Temperature drift, stress birefringence and low frequency vibration lead to the randomness and fluctuation of the output of optical voltage sensor(OVS). In order to solve the problem, this study adopts the lock-in amplifier technology with the aid of a high-speed rotating electrode to realize electric field modulation. This technology could shift the measured signal frequency band from near 50 Hz moved to several kilometer Hz, so as to make the output signal avoid the interference from low-frequency temperature drift, stress birefringence and vibration, leading to higher stability and reliability. The electro-optic coupling wave theory and static electric field finite element method are utilized to investigate the shape of modulation wave. The simulation results proves that lock-in technology is able to prevent the measured voltage signal from the large step signal interference and restore the perfect original signal.

Unsupervised Voice Activity Detection by Modeling Source and System   Information using Zero Frequency Filtering,"Eklavya Sarkar, RaviShankar Prasad, Mathew Magimai. -Doss","Voice activity detection (VAD) is an important pre-processing step for speech technology applications. The task consists of deriving segment boundaries of audio signals which contain voicing information. In recent years, it has been shown that voice source and vocal tract system information can be extracted using zero-frequency filtering (ZFF) without making any explicit model assumptions about the speech signal. This paper investigates the potential of zero-frequency filtering for jointly modeling voice source and vocal tract system information, and proposes two approaches for VAD. The first approach demarcates voiced regions using a composite signal composed of different zero-frequency filtered signals. The second approach feeds the composite signal as input to the rVAD algorithm. These approaches are compared with other supervised and unsupervised VAD methods in the literature, and are evaluated on the Aurora-2 database, across a range of SNRs (20 to -5 dB). Our studies show that the proposed ZFF-based methods perform comparable to state-of-art VAD methods and are more invariant to added degradation and different channel characteristics.",2022-06-27T16:15:30Z,2022-06-27T16:15:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13420v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13420v1,"eess.AS, eess.SP"
Fast orthogonality deficiency compensation for improved frequency   selective image extrapolation,"J√ºrgen Seiler, Andr√© Kaup","The purpose of this paper is to introduce a very efficient algorithm for signal extrapolation. It can widely be used in many applications in image and video communication, e. g. for concealment of block errors caused by transmission errors or for prediction in video coding. The signal extrapolation is performed by extending a signal from a limited number of known samples into areas beyond these samples. Therefore a finite set of orthogonal basis functions is used and the known part of the signal is projected onto them. Since the basis functions are not orthogonal regarding the area of the known samples, the projection does not lead to the real portion a basis function has of the signal. The proposed algorithm efficiently copes with this non-orthogonality resulting in very good objective and visual extrapolation results for edges, smooth areas, as well as structured areas. Compared to an existent implementation, this algorithm has a significantly lower computational complexity without any degradation in quality. The processing time can be reduced by a factor larger than 100.",2022-07-04T05:26:52Z,2022-07-04T05:26:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01205v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01205v1,eess.IV
Homogeneity Enforced Calibration of Stage Nonidealities for Pipelined   ADCs,"Matthias Wagner, Oliver Lang, Thomas Bauernfeind, Mario Huemer","Pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are fundamental components of various signal processing systems requiring high sampling rates and a high linearity. Over the past years, calibration techniques have been intensively investigated to increase the linearity. In this work, we propose an equalization-based calibration technique which does not require knowledge of the ADC input signal for calibration. For that, a test signal and a scaled version of it are fed into the ADC sequentially, while only the corresponding output samples are used for calibration. Several test signal sources are possible, such as a signal generator (SG) or the system application (SA) itself. For the latter case, the presented method corresponds to a background calibration technique. Thus, slowly changing errors are tracked and calibrated continuously. Because of the low computational complexity of the calibration technique, it is suitable for an on-chip implementation. Ultimately, this work contains an analysis of the stability and convergence behavior as well as simulation results.",2022-07-11T13:03:06Z,2022-07-11T13:03:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04835v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04835v1,eess.SP
Towards Realistic Statistical Channel Models For Positioning: Evaluating   the Impact of Early Clusters,"Mohammad Alawieh, George Yammine, Ernst Eberlein, Birendra Ghimire, Norbert Franke, Stephan J√§ckel, Tobias Feigl, Christopher Mutschler","Physical effects such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction cause a radio signal to arrive from a transmitter to a receiver in multiple replicas that have different amplitude and rotation. Bandwidth-limited signals, such as positioning reference signals, have a limited time resolution. In reality, the signal is often reflected in the close vicinity of a transmitter and receiver, which causes the displacement of the observed peak from the true peak expected according to the line of sight (LOS) geometry between the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we show that the existing channel model specified for performance evaluation within 3GPP fails to model the above phenomena. As a result, the simulation results deviate significantly from the measured values. Based on our measurement and simulation results, we propose a model for incorporating the signal reflection by obstacles in the vicinity of transmitter or receiver, so that the outcome of the model corresponds to the measurement made in such scenario.",2022-07-16T05:07:54Z,2022-08-08T14:29:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07838v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07838v2,eess.SP
Digitally-assisted photonic analog domain self-interference cancellation   for in-band full-duplex MIMO systems via LS algorithm with adaptive order,"Moxuan Han, Yang Chen","A digitally-assisted photonic analog domain self-interference cancellation (SIC) and frequency downconversion method is proposed for in-band full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using the least square (LS) algorithm with adaptive order. The SIC and frequency downconversion are achieved in the optical domain via a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (DP-MZM), while the downconverted signal is processed by the LS algorithm with adaptive order that is used to track the response of the multipath self-interference (SI) channel and reconstruct the reference signal for SIC. The proposed method can overcome the reconstruction difficulty of the multipath analog reference signal for SIC with high complexity in the MIMO scenario and can also solve the problem that the order of the reference reconstruction algorithm is not optimized when the wireless environment changes. An experiment is carried out to verify the concept. 30.2, 26.9, 23.5, 19.5, and 15.8 dB SIC depths are achieved when the SI signal has a carrier frequency of 10 GHz and baud rates of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 Gbaud, respectively.

Parameter Estimation of Mixed Gaussian-Impulsive Noise: An U-net++ Based   Method,"Tianfu Qi, Jun Wang, Xiaonan Chen, Wei Huang","In many scenarios, the communication system suffers from both Gaussian white noise and non-Gaussian impulsive noise. In order to design optimal signal detection method, it is necessary to estimate the parameters of mixed Gaussian-impulsive noise. Even though this issue can be well tackled with respect to pure mixed noise, it is quite challenging based on the received single-channel signal including both transmitting signal and mixed noise. To mitigate the negative impact of transmitting signal, we propose a parameter estimation method by utilizing a neural network, namely U-net++, to separate the mixed noise from the received single-channel signal.

On semi shift invariant graph filters,"Feng Ji, See Hian Lee, Wee Peng Tay","In graph signal processing, one of the most important subjects is the study of filters, i.e., linear transformations that capture relations between graph signals. One of the most important families of filters is the space of shift invariant filters, defined as transformations commute with a preferred graph shift operator. Shift invariant filters have a wide range of applications in graph signal processing and graph neural networks. A shift invariant filter can be interpreted geometrically as an information aggregation procedure (from local neighborhood), and can be computed easily using matrix multiplication. However, there are still drawbacks to using solely shift invariant filters in applications, such as being restrictively homogeneous. In this paper, we generalize shift invariant filters by introducing and studying semi shift invariant filters. We give an application of semi shift invariant filters with a new signal processing framework, the subgraph signal processing. Moreover, we also demonstrate how semi shift invariant filters can be used in graph neural networks.",2022-09-28T08:23:11Z,2022-09-28T08:23:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13909v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13909v1,eess.SP

RFI is commonly mitigated at the Radio Telescope without any active collaboration with the interfering sources. In this work, we provide a method of signal characterization and its use in subsequent cancellation, that uses Eigenspaces derived from the telescope and the transmitter signals. This is different from conventional time-frequency domain analysis, which is limited to fixed characterizations (e.g., complex exponential in Fourier methods) that cannot adapt to the changing statistics (e.g., autocorrelation) of the RFI, typically observed in communication systems. We have presented effectiveness of this collaborative method using real-world astronomical signals and practical simulated LTE signals (downlink and uplink) as source of RFI along with propagation conditions based on preset benchmarks and standards. Through our analysis and simulation using these signals, we are able to remove 89.04% of the RFI from cellular networks, which reduces excision at the Telescope and capable of significantly improving throughput as corrupted time frequency bins data becomes usable.",2022-10-31T06:19:12Z,2022-10-31T06:19:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17083v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17083v1,eess.SP
A Distributed Adaptive Algorithm for Node-Specific Signal Fusion   Problems in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Cem Ates Musluoglu, Alexander Bertrand","Wireless sensor networks consist of sensor nodes that are physically distributed over different locations. Spatial filtering procedures exploit the spatial correlation across these sensor signals to fuse them into a filtered signal satisfying some optimality condition. However, gathering the raw sensor data in a fusion center to solve the problem in a centralized way would lead to high energy and communication costs. The distributed adaptive signal fusion (DASF) framework has been proposed as a generic method to solve these signal fusion problems in a distributed fashion, which reduces the communication and energy costs in the network. The DASF framework assumes that there is a common goal across the nodes, i.e., the optimal filter is shared across the network. However, many applications require a node-specific objective, while all these node-specific objectives are still related via a common latent data model. In this work, we propose the DANSF algorithm which builds upon the DASF framework, and extends it to allow for node-specific spatial filtering problems.",2022-11-02T18:12:24Z,2022-11-02T18:12:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01411v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01411v1,eess.SP

This leads to designs that have relatively large area and power consumption figures. However, wearable devices for always-on biomedical applications do not necessarily require to reproduce highly accurate recordings of bio-signals, provided their end-to-end classification or anomaly detection performance is not compromised. Within this context, we propose an adaptive Asynchronous Delta Modulator (ADM) circuit designed to encode signals with an event-based representation optimally suited for low-power on-line spiking neural network processors. The novel aspect of this work is the adaptive thresholding feature of the ADM, which allows the circuit to modulate and minimize the rate of events produced with the amplitude and noise characteristics of the signal.

Hardware Prototype of a Time-Encoding Sub-Nyquist ADC,"Hila Naaman, Nimrod Glazer, Moshe Namer, Daniel Bilik, Shlomi Savariego, Yonina C. Eldar","Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are key components of digital signal processing. Classical samplers in this framework are controlled by a global clock. At high sampling rates, clocks are expensive and power-hungry, thus increasing the cost and energy consumption of ADCs. It is, therefore, desirable to sample using a clock-less ADC at the lowest possible rate. An integrate-and-fire time-encoding machine (IF-TEM) is a time-based power-efficient asynchronous design that is not synced to a global clock. Finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals, ubiquitous in various applications, have fewer degrees of freedom than the signal's Nyquist rate, enabling sub-Nyquist sampling signal models. This work proposes a power-efficient IF-TEM ADC architecture and demonstrates sub-Nyquist sampling and FRI signal recovery. Using an IF-TEM, we implement in hardware the first sub-Nyquist time-based sampler. We offer a feasible approach for accurately estimating the FRI parameters from IF-TEM data.

How Potent are Evasion Attacks for Poisoning Federated Learning-Based   Signal Classifiers?,"Su Wang, Rajeev Sahay, Christopher G. Brinton","There has been recent interest in leveraging federated learning (FL) for radio signal classification tasks. In FL, model parameters are periodically communicated from participating devices, training on their own local datasets, to a central server which aggregates them into a global model. While FL has privacy/security advantages due to raw data not leaving the devices, it is still susceptible to several adversarial attacks. In this work, we reveal the susceptibility of FL-based signal classifiers to model poisoning attacks, which compromise the training process despite not observing data transmissions. In this capacity, we develop an attack framework in which compromised FL devices perturb their local datasets using adversarial evasion attacks. As a result, the training process of the global model significantly degrades on in-distribution signals (i.e., signals received over channels with identical distributions at each edge device). We compare our work to previously proposed FL attacks and reveal that as few as one adversarial device operating with a low-powered perturbation under our attack framework can induce the potent model poisoning attack to the global classifier. Moreover, we find that more devices partaking in adversarial poisoning will proportionally degrade the classification performance.",2023-01-21T02:57:15Z,2023-01-21T02:57:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08866v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08866v1,eess.SP

Further, a design procedure is proposed in which the linearizer parameters are obtained through matrix inversion. Thereby, the costly and time consuming numerical optimization that is traditionally used when training neural networks is eliminated. Moreover, the design and evaluation incorporate a large set of multi-tone signals covering the first Nyquist band.

To circumvent the sampling rate and bandwidth problem of electronic DACs, we demonstrate the generation of wide-band signals with low-bandwidth electronics. This generation is based on orthogonal sampling with sinc-pulse sequences in N parallel branches. The method not only reduces the sampling rate and bandwidth, at the same time the effective number of bits (ENOB) is improved, dramatically reducing the requirements on the electronic signal processing. In proof of concept experiments the generation of analog signals, as well as Nyquist shaped and normal data will be shown.

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are widely used navigation systems, but they are vulnerable to radio frequency interference (RFI), resulting in disruptions of satellite navigation signals. Recognizing this limitation, extensive research is being conducted on alternative navigation systems. In the maritime industry, ongoing research focuses on a groundbased integrated navigation system called R-Mode. R-Mode utilizes medium frequency (MF) differential GNSS (DGNSS) and very high-frequency data exchange system (VDES) signals as ranging signals for positioning and incorporates the existing ground-based navigation system known as enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran). However, MF R-Mode, which uses MF DGNSS signals for positioning, exhibits significant performance differences between daytime and nighttime due to skywave interference caused by signals reflecting off the ionosphere. In this study, we propose a skywave ground truth generation algorithm that is crucial for studying mitigation methods for MF R-Mode skywave interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed algorithm using field-test data.",2023-09-01T03:39:49Z,2024-01-28T07:55:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00234v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00234v3,eess.SP
Sensing With Random Signals,"Shihang Lu, Fan Liu, Fuwang Dong, Yifeng Xiong, Jie Xu, Ya-Feng Liu","Radar systems typically employ well-designed deterministic signals for target sensing. In contrast to that, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems have to use random signals to convey useful information, potentially causing sensing performance degradation. In this paper, we define a new sensing performance metric, namely, ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE), accounting for the randomness of ISAC signals. Then, we investigate a data-dependent precoding scheme to minimize the ELMMSE, which attains the optimized sensing performance at the price of high computational complexity. To reduce the complexity, we present an alternative data-independent precoding scheme and propose a stochastic gradient projection (SGP) algorithm for ELMMSE minimization, which can be trained offline by locally generated signal samples.

HDR Imaging With One-Bit Quantization,"Arian Eamaz, Farhang Yeganegi, Mojtaba Soltanalian","Modulo sampling and dithered one-bit quantization frameworks have emerged as promising solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and sensors. Modulo sampling, with its high-resolution approach utilizing modulo ADCs, offers an unlimited dynamic range, while dithered one-bit quantization offers cost-efficiency and reduced power consumption while operating at elevated sampling rates. Our goal is to explore the synergies between these two techniques, leveraging their unique advantages, and to apply them to non-bandlimited signals within spline spaces. One noteworthy application of these signals lies in High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging. In this paper, we expand upon the Unlimited One-Bit (UNO) sampling framework, initially conceived for bandlimited signals, to encompass non-bandlimited signals found in the context of HDR imaging. We present a novel algorithm rigorously examined for its ability to recover images from one-bit modulo samples. Additionally, we introduce a sufficient condition specifically designed for UNO sampling to perfectly recover non-bandlimited signals within spline spaces.

However, challenges such as training instability and dynamical inaccuracy limit their utility in high-speed rail (HSR) bogie fault diagnosis. To address these challenges, we introduce the Pulse Voltage-Guided Conditional Diffusion Model (VGCDM). Unlike traditional implicit GANs, VGCDM adopts a sequential U-Net architecture, facilitating multi-phase denoising diffusion for generation, which bolsters training stability and mitigate convergence issues. VGCDM also incorporates control pulse voltage by cross-attention mechanism to ensure the alignment of vibration with voltage signals, enhancing the Conditional Diffusion Model's progressive controlablity. Consequently, solely straightforward sampling of control voltages, ensuring the efficient transformation from Gaussian Noise to vibration signals. This adaptability remains robust even in scenarios with time-varying speeds. To validate the effectiveness, we conducted two case studies using SQ dataset and high-simulation HSR bogie dataset. The results of our experiments unequivocally confirm that VGCDM outperforms other generative models, achieving the best RSME, PSNR, and FSCS, showing its superiority in conditional HSR bogie vibration signal generation.

Metasurface Sensing Approach to DOA Estimation of Coherent Signals,"Yishuo Zhao, Yan Hu, Yougen Xu","The DOA estimation method of coherent signals based on periodical coding metasurface is proposed. After periodical coding, the DOA information of incident signals in the time domain is represented as the amplitude and phase information at different frequency points in the frequency domain. Finite time Fourier transform (FTFT) is performed on the received signal and appropriate frequency points are selected to reconstruct the frequency domain snapshot, then pattern smoothing (PS) technique is applied to execute DOA estimation. Compared with conventional DOA estimation methods, the proposed method has two main advantages: one is that only a single receiving channel is needed to avoid the appearance of channel mismatch errors, the other is that it can process with multiple coherent signals. The performance curves of the proposed method are analyzed under different conditions and compared with existing methods.

Irregularity-Aware Bandlimited Approximation for Graph Signal   Interpolation,"Darukeesan Pakiyarajah, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega","In most work to date, graph signal sampling and reconstruction algorithms are intrinsically tied to graph properties, assuming bandlimitedness and optimal sampling set choices. However, practical scenarios often defy these assumptions, leading to suboptimal performance. In the context of sampling and reconstruction, graph irregularities lead to varying contributions from sampled nodes for interpolation and differing levels of reliability for interpolated nodes. The existing GFT-based methods in the literature make bandlimited signal approximations without considering graph irregularities and the relative significance of nodes, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction performance under various mismatch conditions. In this paper, we leverage the GFT equipped with a specific inner product to address graph irregularities and account for the relative importance of nodes during the bandlimited signal approximation and interpolation process. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms other GFT-based approaches for bandlimited signal interpolation in challenging scenarios, such as sampling sets selected independently of the underlying graph, low sampling rates, and high noise levels.",2023-12-14T23:58:04Z,2024-01-21T19:52:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09405v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09405v2,eess.SP
Semantic Synchronization for Enhanced Reliability in Communication   Systems,"Xiaoyi Liu, Haotai Liang, Chen Dong, Xiaodong Xu","As a new communication paradigm, semantic communication has received widespread attention in communication fields. However, since the decoding of semantic signals relies on contextual knowledge, misalignment between the starting position of the semantic signal and the AI-based semantic decoder would prevent source signal recovery and reconstruction. To achieve more precise semantic communication, this study proposes an image-based semantic synchronization method leveraging intrinsic semantic features of image content. Specifically, a shared synchronized image (SyncImg) is encoded into a synchronization vector header at the transmitter and sent to the receiver. The receiver adopts a sliding window semantic decoder combined with classification and template matching methods to locate the synchronization point. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods, the proposed method achieves a lower miss detected ratio (MDR) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) under low signal-to-noise ratios, realizing accurate synchronization of semantic signals across different devices.",2023-12-02T14:23:22Z,2023-12-02T14:23:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10051v1,eess.SP
Frequency analysis and filter design for directed graphs with polar   decomposition,"Semin Kwak, Laura Shimabukuro, Antonio Ortega","In this study, we challenge the traditional approach of frequency analysis on directed graphs, which typically relies on a single measure of signal variation such as total variation. We argue that the inherent directionality in directed graphs necessitates a multifaceted analytical approach that incorporates multiple signal variations definitions. Our methodology leverages the polar decomposition to define two distinct variations, each associated with different matrices derived from this decomposition. This approach provides a novel interpretation in the node domain and reveals aspects of graph signals that may be overlooked with a singular measure of variation. Additionally, we develop graph filters specifically designed to smooth graph signals in accordance with our proposed variations. These filters allow for bypassing costly filtering operations associated with the original graph through effective cascading. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology using an M-block cyclic graph example, validating our claims and showcasing the advantages of our multifaceted approach in analyzing signals on directed graphs.",2023-12-18T18:22:55Z,2024-01-15T21:06:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11421v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11421v2,eess.SP
Distributionally Robust Receive Beamforming,"Shixiong Wang, Wei Dai, Geoffrey Ye Li","This article investigates signal estimation in wireless transmission (i.e., receive beamforming) from the perspective of statistical machine learning, where the transmit signals may be from an integrated sensing and communication system; that is, 1) signals may be not only discrete constellation points but also arbitrary complex values; 2) signals may be spatially correlated. Particular attention is paid to handling various uncertainties such as the uncertainty of the transmit signal covariance, the uncertainty of the channel matrix, the uncertainty of the channel noise covariance, the existence of channel impulse noises, and the limited sample size of pilots. To proceed, a distributionally robust machine learning framework that is insensitive to the above uncertainties is proposed, which reveals that channel estimation is not a necessary operation. For optimal linear estimation, the proposed framework includes several existing beamformers as special cases such as diagonal loading and eigenvalue thresholding. For optimal nonlinear estimation, estimators are limited in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and neural network function spaces, and corresponding uncertainty-aware solutions (e.g., kernelized diagonal loading) are derived. In addition, we prove that the ridge and kernel ridge regression methods in machine learning are distributionally robust against diagonal perturbation in feature covariance.",2024-01-22T20:20:48Z,2024-06-10T17:48:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12345v2,eess.SP
KGAMC: A Novel Knowledge Graph Driven Automatic Modulation   Classification Scheme,"Yike Li, Lu Yua, Fuhui Zhou, Qihui Wu, Naofal Al-Dhahir, Kai-Kit Wong","Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a promising technology to realize intelligent wireless communications in the sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks. Recently, many data-and-knowledge dual-driven AMC schemes have achieved high accuracy. However, most of these schemes focus on generating additional prior knowledge or features of blind signals, which consumes longer computation time and ignores the interpretability of the model learning process. To solve these problems, we propose a novel knowledge graph (KG) driven AMC (KGAMC) scheme by training the networks under the guidance of domain knowledge. A modulation knowledge graph (MKG) with the knowledge of modulation technical characteristics and application scenarios is constructed and a relation-graph convolution network (RGCN) is designed to extract knowledge of the MKG. This knowledge is utilized to facilitate the signal features separation of the data-oriented model by implementing a specialized feature aggregation method. Simulation results demonstrate that KGAMC achieves superior classification performance compared to other benchmark schemes, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. Furthermore, the signal features of the high-order modulation are more discriminative, thus reducing the confusion between similar signals.",2024-02-29T14:13:46Z,2024-03-01T05:22:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19188v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19188v2,eess.SP
Sub-Nyquist Sampling OFDM Radar With a Time-Frequency Phase-Coded   Waveform,"Seonghyeon Kang, Kawon Han, Songcheol Hong","This paper presents a time-frequency phase-coded sub-Nyquist sampling orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (PC-SNS-OFDM) radar system to reduce the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling rate without any additional hardware or signal processing. The proposed radar divides the transmitted OFDM signal into multiple sub-bands along the frequency axis and provides orthogonality to these sub-bands by multiplying phase codes in both the time and frequency domains. Although the sampling rate is reduced by the factor of the number of sub-bands, the sub-bands above the sampling rate are folded into the lowest one due to aliasing. In the process of restoring the signals in folded sub-bands to those in full signal bands, the proposed PC-SNS-OFDM radar effectively eliminates symbol-mismatch noise while introducing trade-offs in the range and Doppler ambiguities. The utilization of phase codes in both the frequency and time domains provides flexible control of the range and Doppler ambiguities. It also improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detected targets compared to an earlier sub-Nyquist sampling OFDM radar system.

Signal selective amplification for below-the-threshold stimulus in   Fitzhugh-Nagumo neuronal model,Mariia Sorokina,"Brain operates at remarkably low signal power. It has been noted that noise may play a constructive role in neural networks and facilitate the subthreshold signaling. The process of spiking pattern excitation at the characteristic neuronal spiking frequency from the random noisy stimulus remains unexplained. Furthermore, recent research indicates that neuronal processing enables signal selective amplification. Also, there is a growing number of studies indicating the role of coloured noise for spike generation, while noise shaping effect have been recently observed in neuronal networks as well as in single neurons. We demonstrate for the first time that noise shaping enables efficient signal amplification and spike excitation for below-the-threshold stimulus. On the example of the seminal FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model we reveal that the complex interplay between the fast and slow FHN variables leads to noise accumulation at the FHN characteristic spiking frequencies, while tails follow a power-law frequency scaling.

Predictive Demodulation for Chaotic Communications,"Marc Martinez-Gost, Ana P√©rez-Neira, Miguel √Ångel Lagunas","Chaotic signals offer promising characteristics for wireless communications due to their wideband nature, low cross-correlation, and sensitivity to initial conditions. Although classical chaotic modulation schemes like Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) can theoretically match the performance of traditional modulation techniques (i.e., bit error rate), practical challenges, such as the difficulty in generating accurate signal replicas at the receiver, limit their effectiveness. Besides, chaotic signals are often considered unpredictable despite their deterministic nature. In this paper, we challenge this view by introducing a novel modulation scheme for chaotic communications that leverages the deterministic behavior of chaotic signals. The proposed approach eliminates the need for synchronized replicas of transmitted waveforms at the receiver. Moreover, to enhance noise robustness, we employ M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation on the chaotic samples. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms CSK when perfect replicas are unavailable, with the best performance achieved for low-order modulations, and resulting in minimal delay increase.",2024-09-10T16:35:23Z,2024-09-10T16:35:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06630v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06630v1,eess.SP
Signal Detection in Near-field Communication with Unknown Noise   Characteristics: A Diffusion Model Method,"Changyuan Zhao, Jiacheng Wang, Ruichen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Dong In Kim, Hongyang Du","In this letter, we present a diffusion model method for signal detection in near-field communication with unknown noise characteristics. We consider an uplink transmission of a near-filed MIMO communication system consisting of multiple mobile terminals and one base station with multiple antennas. Then, we proposed a Maximum Likelihood Estimation Diffusion Detector (MLEDD) aiming at learning the distribution of unknown noise. To this end, we define an error function via Bayes' theorem to detect the source signal. Moreover, we present an implementation of the proposed framework. The performance of the proposed method in terms of bit error rate shows that it outperforms the MLE detector, Detection Network (DetNet), and Maximum Normalizing Flow Estimate method (MANFE) across different signal-to-noise ratios and noise distributions. Especially when the noise distribution is intractable, diffusion, as a state-of-the-art probability model, has the best distribution learning ability compared to other models. These results affirm that this framework can effectively detect signals in near-field scenarios.",2024-09-21T06:21:36Z,2024-09-21T06:21:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14031v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14031v1,eess.SP
The Comparison of Riemannian Geometric Matrix-CFAR Signal Detectors,"Yusuke Ono, Linyu Peng","Essential characteristics of signal data can be captured by the autocovariance matrix, which, in the stationary scenarios, is Toeplitz Hermitian positive definite (HPD). In this paper, several well-known Riemannian geometric structures of HPD matrix manifolds are applied to signal detection, including the affine invariant Riemannian metric, the log-Euclidean metric, and the Bures--Wasserstein (BW) metric, the last of which was recently extended to HPD manifolds. Riemannian gradient descent algorithms are proposed to solve the corresponding geometric means and medians, that play fundamental roles in the detection process. Simulations within the scenario using the ideal steering vector as the target signal provide compelling evidence that the BW detectors outperform the other geometric detectors as well as the conventional adaptive matched filter and adaptive normalized matched filter when observation data are limited. Further simulations demonstrate that the matrix-CFAR is robust in scenarios where the signal is mismatched. In addition to detection performances, robustness of the geometric detectors to outliers and computational complexity of the algorithms are analysed.",2024-09-27T01:38:03Z,2024-09-27T01:38:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18377v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18377v1,eess.SP

LiTformer: Efficient Modeling and Analysis of High-Speed Link   Transmitters Using Non-Autoregressive Transformer,"Songyu Sun, Xiao Dong, Yanliang Sha, Quan Chen, Cheng Zhuo","High-speed serial links are fundamental to energy-efficient and high-performance computing systems such as artificial intelligence, 5G mobile and automotive, enabling low-latency and high-bandwidth communication. Transmitters (TXs) within these links are key to signal quality, while their modeling presents challenges due to nonlinear behavior and dynamic interactions with links. In this paper, we propose LiTformer: a Transformer-based model for high-speed link TXs, with a non-sequential encoder and a Transformer decoder to incorporate link parameters and capture long-range dependencies of output signals. We employ a non-autoregressive mechanism in model training and inference for parallel prediction of the signal sequence.

A Novel Multiscale Spatial Phase Estimate with the Structure Multivector,"Brian Knight, Naoki Saito","The monogenic signal (MS) was introduced by Felsberg and Sommer, and independently by Larkin under the name vortex operator. It is a two-dimensional (2D) analog of the well-known analytic signal, and allows for direct amplitude and phase demodulation of (amplitude and phase) modulated images so long as the signal is intrinsically one-dimensional (i1D). Felsberg's PhD dissertation also introduced the structure multivector (SMV), a model allowing for intrinsically 2D (i2D) structure. While the monogenic signal has become a well-known tool in the image processing community, the SMV is little used, although even in the case of i1D signals it provides a more robust orientation estimation than the MS. We argue the SMV is more suitable in standard i1D image feature extraction due to the this improvement, and extend the steerable wavelet frames of Held et al. to accommodate the additional features of the SMV. We then propose a novel quality map based on local orientation variance that yields a multiscale phase estimate which performs well even when SNR $\ge 1$. The performance is evaluated on several synthetic phase estimation tasks as well as on a fine-scale fingerprint registration task related to the 2D phase demodulation problem.",2024-12-11T03:32:07Z,2024-12-11T03:32:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08070v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08070v1,"eess.IV, eess.SP"
Parameter Estimation based Automatic Modulation Recognition for Radio   Frequency Signal,"Shuo Wang, Kuojun Yang, Zelin Ji, Qinchuan Zhang, Huiqing Pan","Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) critically contributes to spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access, and intelligent communications in cognitive radio systems. The introduction of deep learning has greatly improved the accuracy of AMR. However, current automatic identification methods require the input of key parameters such as the carrier frequency, which is necessary to convert the radio frequency (RF) to a base-band signal before it can be used for identification. In addition, the high complexity of deep learning models leads to high computational effort and long recognition times of existing methods, which are difficult to implement in demodulation system deployments. To address the above issues, in this paper, we first use power spectrum analysis to estimate the carrier frequency and signal bandwidth, which realizes the effective conversion from RF signals to base-band signals. This paper chooses the long short-term memory (LSTM) network as the model for automatic identification, which has low implementation complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, by training the LSTM with actual sampling data combined with parameter estimation (PE), the method proposed in this paper can guarantee more than 90% format recognition accuracy.",2024-12-11T10:03:06Z,2024-12-11T10:03:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08251v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08251v1,eess.SP
Hybrid Network- and User-Centric Scalable Cell-Free Massive MIMO for   Fronthaul Signaling Minimization,"Phu Lai, Wei Xiang, William Damario Lukito, Khoa Tran Phan, Peng Cheng, Chang Liu, Guoqiang Mao","Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) coordinates a great number of distributed access points (APs) with central processing units (CPUs), effectively reducing interference and ensuring uniform service quality for user equipment (UEs). However, its cooperative nature can result in intense fronthaul signaling between CPUs in large-scale networks. To reduce the inter-CPU fronthaul signaling for systems with limited fronthaul capacity, we propose a low-complexity online UE-AP association approach for scalable CFmMIMO that combines network- and user-centric clustering methodologies, relies on local channel information only, and can handle dynamic UE arrivals. Numerical results demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art method on fronthaul signaling minimization, our approach can save up to 94% of the fronthaul signaling load and 83% of the CPU processing power at the cost of only up to 8.6% spectral efficiency loss, or no loss in some cases.",2024-12-20T01:09:21Z,2024-12-20T01:09:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15475v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15475v1,eess.SP
Tri-Spectral PPG: Robust Reflective Photoplethysmography by Fusing   Multiple Wavelengths for Cardiac Monitoring,"Manuel Meier, Berken Utku Demirel, Christian Holz","Multi-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors have found widespread adoption in wearable devices for monitoring cardiac health.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method that simultaneously fuses multi-channel PPG signals into a single recovered PPG signal that can be input to further processing. Via signal fusion, our learning-based method compensates for the artifacts that affect wavelengths to different extents, such as motion and ambient light changes. We evaluate our method on a novel dataset of multi-channel PPG recordings and electrocardiogram recordings for reference from 10 participants over the course of 13 hours during real-world activities outside the laboratory.

Sidelobe Level Reduction in the ACF of NLFM Signals Using the Smoothing   Spline Method,"Roohollah Ghavamirad, Ramezan Ali Sadeghzadeh, Mohammad Ali Sebt","The high level of sidelobes in the autocorrelation function of the nonlinear frequency modulation signal is a challenge. One of the conventional methods to reduce the sidelobe levels is to use the principle of stationary phase. In this method, the frequency function is calculated using a selection window. The signal frequency function cannot be obtained in closed form and numerical methods must be used to find it. This is usually done using the polynomial curve fitting. In this paper, the frequency function of the signal has been obtained using the smoothing spline method.

To address this, we propose a neural receiver designed to optimize Bit Error Rate (BER) for vehicle to network (V2N) uplink scenario in 6G network. We train multiple neural receivers by changing its trainable parameters and use the best fit model as proposition for large scale deployment. Our proposed neural receiver gets signal in frequency domain at the base station (BS) as input and generates optimal log likelihood ratio (LLR) at the output. It estimates the channel based on the received signal, equalizes and demodulates the higher order modulated signal. Later, to evaluate multi-modality of the proposed model, we test it across diverse V2X data flows (e.g., image, video, gps, lidar cloud points and radar detection signal).

We present a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon, where the signals experience logarithmic transform prior to analogue-to-digital conversion, resulting in non-uniform quantization. This process reduces the quantization noise of low-amplitude signals that constitute a substantial portion of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, thereby improving ILC performance.

We show that many conventional methods of graph signal estimation, reconstruction and imputation, can be reinterpreted as finding the mean of a posterior Gaussian distribution, with a covariance matrix shaped by the graph structure. In this perspective, assumptions of signal smoothness as well as bandlimitedness are naturally expressible as the choice of certain prior distributions; noisy, noise-free or partial observations are expressible in terms of certain likelihood models. In addition to providing a point estimate, as most standard estimation strategies do, our probabilistic framework enables us to characterize the shape of the estimated signal distribution around the estimate in terms of the posterior covariance matrix.",2025-02-18T15:49:33Z,2025-02-18T15:49:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12971v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12971v1,eess.SP

In that context, simplicial complexes (SCs) are emerging as a tractable candidate to handle such domains. The first step in using SC-based processing and learning schemes is to identify the topology of the SC, which is the problem investigated in this paper. In particular, we assume that we observe a number of signals (features) associated with the nodes of the SC (simplices of order 0) as well as signals (features) associated with a subset of the edges of the SC (simplices of order 1). The goal is then to use these signals to learn the remaining edges as well as the triangles that are filled (simplices of order 2). To address this problem, we assume that the signals are smooth on the unknown SC and that the higher-order relations are sparse. We then postulate the learning problem as a nonconvex optimization and develop an efficient (block-coordinate) algorithm to identify the SC topology.",2025-02-27T14:57:58Z,2025-02-27T14:57:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20159v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20159v1,eess.SP
Deep Learning Models for Conditioning Extremely Noisy Signals,"Andrea Fa√∫ndez Quezada, Salvatore La Cavera III, Sidahmed A Abayzeed","This paper presents a comparison of several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for extracting target signals in highly noisy measurement conditions. Four CNN architectures were investigated. The first comprises six consecutive convolutional blocks while the second employs a U-Net structure. The third architecture introduces a new model inspired by the principles of wavelet transform. It consists of three CNN blocks with varied kernel sizes branching from the input layer before merging into consecutive concatenation and dense layers. The fourth is a Multilevel Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (MWCNN), resembling U-net but the upsampling and downsampling are replaced by Discrete Wavelet transform and its inverse respectively. To evaluate these architectures, synthetic data were generated using pulse trains corrupted with various degrees of Gaussian noise to simulate measurement conditions with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as -20 dB. The methodology encompassed the generation and processing of signals with varied parameters: period (5-25 ms), duty cycle (0.1-0.5), and amplitude (1-150 mV). Subsequently, the machine learning models were trained, validated and tested. Finally, the output is processed to recover the signal amplitude before standardisation. The modified MWCNN model demonstrated superior performance achieving a median of 25.9 dB with a mean Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) that decreases with the amplitude of the signal reaching an average RMSE of 0.000128 mV for 1 mV signals. However, for this architecture, the output SNR drops by a factor of 1.23 when the input SNR decreases by 1 dB. All of the architectures exhibited consistency when testing output SNR for different signal amplitudes, periods and duty cycles.

"Operating Regimes of Signaling Cycles: Statics, Dynamics, and Noise   Filtering","Carlos Gomez-Uribe, George C. Verghese, Leonid A. Mirny","A ubiquitous building block of signaling pathways is a cycle of covalent modification (e.g., phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in MAPK cascades). Our paper explores the kind of information processing and filtering that can be accomplished by this simple biochemical circuit.   Signaling cycles are particularly known for exhibiting a highly sigmoidal (ultrasensitive) input-output characteristic in a certain steady-state regime. Here we systematically study the cycle's steady-state behavior and its response to time-varying stimuli. We demonstrate that the cycle can actually operate in four different regimes, each with its specific input-output characteristics. These results are obtained using the total quasi-steady-state approximation, which is more generally valid than the typically used Michaelis-Menten approximation for enzymatic reactions. We invoke experimental data that suggests the possibility of signaling cycles operating in one of the new regimes.   We then consider the cycle's dynamic behavior, which has so far been relatively neglected. We demonstrate that the intrinsic architecture of the cycles makes them act - in all four regimes - as tunable low-pass filters, filtering out high-frequency fluctuations or noise in signals and environmental cues. Moreover, the cutoff frequency can be adjusted by the cell. Numerical simulations show that our analytical results hold well even for noise of large amplitude.

We infer pathways from gene sets corresponding to these events subjected to a random permutation of genes within each set. In Stage I, we use a source separation algorithm to derive unordered and overlapping IFGS's from molecular profiling data, allowing cross talk among IFGS's. In Stage II, we develop a Gibbs sampling like algorithm, Gene Set Gibbs Sampler, to reconstruct signaling pathways from the latent IFGS's derived in Stage I. The novelty of this framework lies in the seamless integration of the two stages and the hypothesis of IFGS's as the basic building blocks for signal pathways. In the proof-of-concept studies, our approach is shown to outperform the existing Bayesian network approaches using both continuous and discrete data generated from benchmark networks in the DREAM initiative.

How nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis can help in sensing   instantaneous heart rate and instantaneous respiratory rate from   photoplethysmography in a reliable way,"Antonio Cicone, Hau-Tieng Wu","Despite the population of the noninvasive, economic, comfortable, and easy-to-install photoplethysmography (PPG), it is still lacking a mathematically rigorous and stable algorithm which is able to simultaneously extract from a single-channel PPG signal the instantaneous heart rate (IHR) and the instantaneous respiratory rate (IRR). In this paper, a novel algorithm called deppG is provided to tackle this challenge. deppG is composed of two theoretically solid nonlinear-type time-frequency analyses techniques, the de-shape short time Fourier transform and the synchrosqueezing transform, which allows us to extract the instantaneous physiological information from the PPG signal in a reliable way. To test its performance, in addition to validating the algorithm by a simulated signal and discussing the meaning of ""instantaneous"", the algorithm is applied to two publicly available batch databases, the Capnobase and the ICASSP 2015 signal processing cup. The former contains PPG signals relative to spontaneous or controlled breathing in static patients, and the latter is made up of PPG signals collected from subjects doing intense physical activities. The accuracies of the estimated IHR and IRR are compared with the ones obtained by other methods, and represent the state-of-the-art in this field of research.

Multivariate Multiscale Dispersion Entropy of Biomedical Times Series,"Hamed Azami, Alberto Fernandez, Javier Escudero","Objective: Due to the non-linearity of numerous biomedical signals, non-linear analysis of multi-channel time series, notably multivariate multiscale entropy (mvMSE), has been extensively used in biomedical signal processing. However, mvMSE has three drawbacks: 1) mvMSE values are either undefined or unreliable for short signals; 2) mvMSE is not fast enough for real-time applications; and 3) the computation of mvMSE for signals with a large number of channels requires the storage of a huge number of elements. Methods: To deal with these problems and improve the stability of mvMSE, we introduce multivariate multiscale dispersion entropy (MDE - mvMDE) as an extension of our recently developed MDE, to quantify the complexity of multivariate time series. Results: We assess mvMDE, in comparison with mvMSE and multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (mvMFE), on correlated and uncorrelated multi-channel noise signals, bivariate autoregressive processes, and three biomedical datasets. The results show that mvMDE takes into account dependencies in patterns across both the time and spatial domains. The mvMDE, mvMSE, and mvMFE methods are consistent in that they lead to similar conclusions about the underlying physiological conditions. However, the proposed mvMDE discriminates various physiological states of the biomedical recordings better than mvMSE and mvMFE. In addition, for both the short and long time series, the mvMDE-based results are noticeably more stable than the mvMSE- and mvMFE-based ones. Conclusion: For short multivariate time series, mvMDE, unlike mvMSE, does not result in undefined values. Furthermore, mvMDE is noticeably faster than mvMFE and mvMSE and also needs to store a considerably smaller number of elements. Significance: Due to its ability to detect different kinds of dynamics of multivariate signals, mvMDE has great potential to analyse various physiological signals.",2017-04-12T22:37:07Z,2017-04-12T22:37:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03947v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03947v1,q-bio.QM
Sparse Bayesian Learning with Dynamic Filtering for Inference of   Time-Varying Sparse Signals,"Matthew R. O'Shaughnessy, Mark A. Davenport, Christopher J. Rozell","Many signal processing applications require estimation of time-varying sparse signals, potentially with the knowledge of an imperfect dynamics model. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dynamic filtering of time-varying sparse signals based on the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. The key idea underlying the algorithm, termed SBL-DF, is the incorporation of a signal prediction generated from a dynamics model and estimates of previous time steps into the hyperpriors of the SBL probability model. The proposed algorithm is robust to imperfect dynamics models (due to the propagation of dynamics information through higher-order statistics), robust to certain undesirable dictionary properties such as coherence (due to properties of the SBL framework), allows the use of arbitrary dynamics models, and requires the tuning of fewer parameters than many other dynamic filtering algorithms do. We also extend the fast marginal likelihood SBL inference procedure to the informative hyperprior setting to create a particularly efficient version of the SBL-DF algorithm. Numerical simulations show that SBL-DF converges much faster and to more accurate solutions than standard SBL and other dynamical filtering algorithms. In particular, we show that SBL-DF outperforms state of the art algorithms when the dictionary contains challenging structure such as coherence and column scaling, as is found in many practical applications.",2019-02-14T14:11:32Z,2019-12-31T15:39:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05362v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05362v2,eess.SP

As a first step towards clarifying the precise role of Ca2+ signaling in dorsal spinal inhibitory neurons for central sensitization, we established methods for characterizing Ca2+ signals in genetically defined populations of these cells. In particular, we employed recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors to deliver subcellularly targeted, genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators into parvalbumin-positive spinal inhibitory neurons. Using wide-field microscopy, we observed both spontaneous and afferent fiber activity triggered Ca2+ signals in these cells. We propose that these methods may be adapted in future studies for the precise characterization and manipulation of Ca2+ signaling in diverse spinal inhibitory neuron subtypes, thereby enabling the clarification of its role in the mechanisms underlying pain chronicity and opening the door for possibly novel treatment directions.",2019-02-17T12:32:50Z,2019-02-17T12:32:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06250v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06250v1,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.TO"
ECG-Based Blood Pressure Estimation Using Mechano-Electric Coupling   Concept,"Seyedeh Somayyeh Mousavi, Mostafa Charmi, Mohammad Firouzmand, Mohammad Hemmati, Maryam Moghadam, Yadollah Ghorbani","The Electrocardiograph signal represents the heart's electrical activity while blood pressure results from the heart's mechanical activity. Previous studies have investigated how the heart's electrical and mechanical activities are related and have referred to their relationship as the Mechano-Electric Coupling term. A new method to estimate the blood pressure including is proposed which uses only the Electrocardiograph signal. In spite of studies performed on feature extraction based on the signals' physiological parameters (Parameter-based), in this work, the feature vectors are formed with samples of the Electrocardiograph signal in a particular time frame (Whole-based) and these vectors are input into Adaptive Boosting Regression to estimate blood pressure. The nonlinear relationship which correlates blood pressure with the Electrocardiograph signal is concluded by the results of this study. According to the results, the used algorithms, for estimating both diastolic blood pressures and mean arterial pressure, are in compliance with the standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Also, according to the British Hypertension Society standard, estimating diastolic blood pressures and mean arterial pressure with the proposed method attain an A grade while it achieves B for systolic blood pressure. The results indicate that using the introduced method, blood pressure can be estimated continuously, noninvasively, without cuff, calibration-free and by using only the Electrocardiograph signal.",2020-08-23T19:34:15Z,2020-08-23T19:34:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10099v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10099v1,eess.SP
Decoding Visual Recognition of Objects from EEG Signals based on   Attention-Driven Convolutional Neural Network,"Jenifer Kalafatovich, Minji Lee, Seong-Whan Lee","The ability to perceive and recognize objects is fundamental for the interaction with the external environment. Studies that investigate them and their relationship with brain activity changes have been increasing due to the possible application in an intuitive brain-machine interface (BMI). In addition, the distinctive patterns when presenting different visual stimuli that make data differentiable enough to be classified have been studied. However, reported classification accuracy still low or employed techniques for obtaining brain signals are impractical to use in real environments. In this study, we aim to decode electroencephalography (EEG) signals depending on the provided visual stimulus. Subjects were presented with 72 photographs belonging to 6 different semantic categories. We classified 6 categories and 72 exemplars according to visual stimuli using EEG signals. In order to achieve a high classification accuracy, we proposed an attention driven convolutional neural network and compared our results with conventional methods used for classifying EEG signals. We reported an accuracy of 50.37% and 26.75% for 6-class and 72-class, respectively. These results statistically outperformed other conventional methods. This was possible because of the application of the attention network using human visual pathways. Our findings showed that EEG signals are possible to differentiate when subjects are presented with visual stimulus of different semantic categories and at an exemplar-level with a high classification accuracy; this demonstrates its viability to be applied it in a real-world BMI.",2020-08-28T06:10:13Z,2020-08-28T06:10:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12490v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12490v1,eess.SP
Low Complexity Lookup Table Aided Soft Output Semidefinite Relaxation   based Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling Detector,"Adem Cicek, Ian Marsland, Enver Cavus, Ebrahim Bedeer, Halim Yanikomeroglu","Spectrum scarcity necessitates innovative, spectral-efficient strategies to meet the ever-growing demand for high data rates. Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling emerges as a compelling spectral-efficient transmission method that pushes transmit data symbols beyond the Nyquist limit, offering enhanced spectral efficiency (SE). While FTN signaling maintains SE with the same energy and bandwidth as the Nyquist signaling, it introduces increased complexity, particularly at higher modulation levels. This complexity predominantly arises from the detection process, which seeks to mitigate the intentional intersymbol interference generated by FTN signaling. Another challenge involves the generation of reliable log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) vital for soft channel decoders. In this study, we introduce a lookup table (LUT) aided soft output semidefinite relaxation (soSDR) based sub-optimal FTN detector, which can be extended to higher modulation levels. This detector possesses polynomial computational complexity, given the negligible complexity associated with soft value generation. Our study assesses the performance of this soft output detector against that of the optimal FTN detector, Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek and Raviv (BCJR) algorithm as the benchmark. The likelihood values produced by our LUT aided semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based FTN signaling detector show promising viability in coded scenario.",2020-09-14T01:01:12Z,2024-06-17T06:27:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06128v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06128v2,eess.SP
Complex Convolutional Neural Networks for Ultrafast Ultrasound Image   Reconstruction from In-Phase/Quadrature Signal,"Jingfeng Lu, Fabien Millioz, Damien Garcia, Sebastien Salles, Dong Ye, Denis Friboulet","Ultrafast ultrasound imaging remains an active area of interest in the ultrasound community due to its ultra-high frame rates. Recently, a wide variety of studies based on deep learning have sought to improve ultrafast ultrasound imaging. Most of these approaches have been performed on radio frequency (RF) signals. However, inphase/quadrature (I/Q) digital beamformers are now widely used as low-cost strategies. In this work, we used complex convolutional neural networks for reconstruction of ultrasound images from I/Q signals. We recently described a convolutional neural network architecture called ID-Net, which exploited an inception layer designed for reconstruction of RF diverging-wave ultrasound images. In the present study, we derive the complex equivalent of this network; i.e., the Complex-valued Inception for Diverging-wave Network (CID-Net) that operates on I/Q data. We provide experimental evidence that CID-Net provides the same image quality as that obtained from RF-trained convolutional neural networks; i.e., using only three I/Q images, the CID-Net produces high-quality images that can compete with those obtained by coherently compounding 31 RF images. Moreover, we show that CID-Net outperforms the straightforward architecture that consists of processing the real and imaginary parts of the I/Q signal separately, which thereby indicates the importance of consistently processing the I/Q signals using a network that exploits the complex nature of such signals.",2020-09-24T07:55:11Z,2021-11-01T03:44:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11536v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11536v3,"eess.IV, eess.SP"
RFEye in the Sky,"Maqsood Ahamed Abdul Careem, Jorge Gomez, Dola Saha, Aveek Dutta","We introduce RFEye, a generalized technique to locate signals independent of the waveform, using a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with only one omnidirectional antenna. This is achieved by acquiring signals from uncoordinated positions within a sphere of 1-meter radius at two nearby locations and formulating an asynchronous, distributed receiver beamforming at the UAV to compute the Direction of Arrival (DoA) from the unknown transmitter. The proposed method includes four steps: 1) Blind detection and extraction of unique signature in the signal to be localized, 2) Asynchronous signal acquisition and conditioning, 3) DoA calculation by creating a virtual distributed antenna array at UAV and 4) Obtaining position fix of emitter using DoA from two locations. These steps are analyzed for various sources of error, computational complexity and compared with widely used signal subspace-based DoA estimation algorithms. RFEye is implemented using an Intel-Aero UAV, equipped with a USRP B205 software-defined radio to acquire signals from a ground emitter. Practical outdoor experiments show that RFEye achieves a median accuracy of 1.03m in 2D and 2.5m in 3D for Wi-Fi, and 1.15m in 2D and 2.7m in 3D for LoRa (Long Range) waveforms, and is robust to external factors like wind and UAV position errors.",2020-11-07T20:45:12Z,2020-11-07T20:45:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03846v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03846v1,eess.SP
Coded Divergent Waves for Fast Ultrasonic Imaging: Optimization and   Comparative Performance Analysis,"Yasin Kumru, Hayrettin K√∂ymen","In this paper, we present the optimal use of coded signals in diverging wave transmission for fast ultrasonic imaging. The performance of coded imaging with diverging waves, quantified by SNR, CNR, speckle power and target signal strength, is optimized in terms of code length, wave profile, aperture size and field of view. We obtained one frame in 200 microseconds using coded diverging wave transmission, equivalent to very high 5000 frames/s rate, where the imaging depth is 7.5 cm. The performances of coded diverging wave transmission and conventional single focused phased array imaging are compared on a single frame basis. Complementary Golay sequences with code lengths ranging from 2 to 10 bits are used to code the signal. The signal strength and SNR obtained using synthetic transmit aperture and conventional single focused phased array imaging techniques, respectively, are used as reference in the performance analysis. We present a method to determine the optimum diverging wave profile to maximize the SNR across the entire viewing sector, which matches the received signal strength distribution to that of synthetic transmit aperture imaging. Optimum diverging wave profiles are determined for different sector angles and for different array apertures. For 90{\deg} sector, the SNR of 8-bit coded signal with optimized diverging wave profile is higher than that of conventional single focused phased array imaging at all depths and regions except the focal region, where it is 2-8 dB lower.",2021-04-21T13:34:25Z,2021-04-21T13:34:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10526v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10526v1,eess.SP
Single-Pixel Compressive Imaging in Shift-Invariant Spaces via Exact   Wavelet Frames,"Tin Vla≈°iƒá, Damir Ser≈°iƒá","This paper introduces a novel framework for single-pixel imaging via compressive sensing (CS) in shift-invariant (SI) spaces by exploiting the sparsity property of a wavelet representation. We reinterpret the acquisition procedure of a single-pixel camera as filtering of the observed signal with continuous-domain functions that lie in an SI subspace spanned by the integer shifts of the box function. The signal is modeled by an arbitrary SI generator whose special case is the box function, which, as we show in the paper, is conventionally used in single-pixel imaging. We propose to use separable B-spline generators which are intuitively complemented by sparsity-inducing spline wavelets. The SI models of the acquisition and the underlying signal lead to an exact discretization of an inherently continuous-domain inverse problem to a finite-dimensional problem of CS type. By solving the CS optimization problem, a parametric representation of the signal is obtained. Such a representation offers many practical advantages in image processing applications. We propose an efficient matrix-free implementation of the framework and conduct it on the standard test images and real-world measurement data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a significant improvement of the reconstruction quality relative to the conventional discretization in CS setups. MATLAB implementation of the method described in this paper has been made publicly available on https://github.com/retiro/compressive_imaging_in_si_spaces.",2021-06-01T11:30:50Z,2022-03-31T09:46:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00404v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00404v2,"eess.IV, eess.SP"
Time Encoding of Finite-Rate-of-Innovation Signals,"Abijith Jagannath Kamath, Sunil Rudresh, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula","Time-encoding of continuous-time signals is an alternative sampling paradigm to conventional methods such as Shannon's sampling. In time-encoding, the signal is encoded using a sequence of time instants where an event occurs, and hence fall under event-driven sampling methods. Time-encoding can be designed agnostic to the global clock of the sampling hardware, which makes sampling asynchronous. Moreover, the encoding is sparse. This makes time-encoding energy efficient. However, the signal representation is nonstandard and in general, nonuniform. In this paper, we consider time-encoding of finite-rate-of-innovation signals, and in particular, periodic signals composed of weighted and time-shifted versions of a known pulse. We consider encoding using both crossing-time-encoding machine (C-TEM) and integrate-and-fire time-encoding machine (IF-TEM). We analyze how time-encoding manifests in the Fourier domain and arrive at the familiar sum-of-sinusoids structure of the Fourier coefficients that can be obtained starting from the time-encoded measurements via a suitable linear transformation. Thereafter, standard FRI techniques become applicable. Further, we extend the theory to multichannel time-encoding such that each channel operates with a lower sampling requirement. We also study the effect of measurement noise, where the temporal measurements are perturbed by additive noise. To combat the effect of noise, we propose a robust optimization framework to simultaneously denoise the Fourier coefficients and estimate the annihilating filter accurately. We provide sufficient conditions for time-encoding and perfect reconstruction using C-TEM and IF-TEM, and furnish extensive simulations to substantiate our findings.",2021-07-07T16:41:10Z,2021-09-03T05:34:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03344v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03344v4,eess.SP
Joint Multi-User Communication and Sensing Exploiting Both Signal and   Environment Sparsity,"Xin Tong, Zhaoyang Zhang, Jue Wang, Chongwen Huang, Merouane Debbah","As a potential technology feature for 6G wireless networks, the idea of sensing-communication integration requires the system not only to complete reliable multi-user communication but also to achieve accurate environment sensing. In this paper, we consider such a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) scenario, in which multiple users use the sparse code multiple access (SCMA) scheme to communicate with the wireless access point (AP). Part of the user signals are scattered by the environment object and reflected by an intelligent reflective surface (IRS) before they arrive at the AP. We exploit the sparsity of both the structured user signals and the unstructured environment and propose an iterative and incremental joint multi-user communication and environment sensing scheme, in which the two processes, i.e., multi-user information detection and environment object detection, interweave with each other thanks to their intrinsic mutual dependence. The proposed algorithm is sliding-window based and also graph based, which can keep on sensing the environment as long as there are illuminating user signals. The trade-off relationship between the key system parameters is analyzed, and the simulation result validates the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",2021-09-06T15:40:47Z,2021-09-06T15:40:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02552v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02552v1,eess.SP
A Radar Signal Deinterleaving Method Based on Semantic Segmentation with   Neural Network,"Wang Chao, Sun Liting, Liu Zhangmeng, Huang Zhitao","Radar signal deinterleaving is an important part of electronic reconnaissance. This study proposes a new radar signal deinterleaving method based on semantic segmentation, which we call ""semantic segmentation deinterleaving"" (SSD). We select representative sequence modeling neural network (NN) architectures and input the difference of time of arrival of the pulse stream into them. According to semantics contained in different radar signal types, each pulse in the pulse stream is marked according to the category of semantics contained, and radar signals are deinterleaved. Compared to the traditional deinterleaving method, the SSD method can adapt to complex pulse repetition interval (PRI) modulation environments without searching the PRI or PRI period. Multiple rounds of search and merging operation are not required for radar signals with multiple pulses in a period. Compared to other deinterleaving methods based on NNs, the SSD method does not need to digitize the data and train a network for each target type. The SSD method also does not need to iterate input and output data. The proposed method has high robustness to pulse loss and noise pulses. This research also shows that recurrent NNs still have more advantages than convolutional NNs in this sequence modeling task.",2021-10-26T13:47:17Z,2022-02-09T09:45:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13706v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13706v2,eess.SP
RSSI-CSI Measurement and Variation Mitigation with Commodity WiFi Device,"Bo Wei, Hang Song, Jiro Katto, Takamaro Kikkawa","Owing to the plentiful information released by the commodity devices, WiFi signals have been widely studied for various wireless sensing applications. In many works, both received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the channel state information (CSI) are utilized as the key factors for precise sensing. However, the calculation and relationship between RSSI and CSI is not explained in detail. Furthermore, there are few works focusing on the measurement variation of the WiFi signal which impacts the sensing results. In this paper, the relationship between RSSI and CSI is studied in detail and the measurement variation of amplitude and phase information is investigated by extensive experiments. In the experiments, transmitter and receiver are directly connected by power divider and RF cables and the signal transmission is quantitatively controlled by RF attenuators. By changing the intensity of attenuation, the measurement of RSSI and CSI is carried out under different conditions. From the results, it is found that in order to get a reliable measurement of the signal amplitude and phase by commodity WiFi, the attenuation of the channels should not exceed 60 dB. Meanwhile, the difference between two channels should be lower than 10 dB. An active control mechanism is suggested to ensure the measurement stability. The findings and criteria of this work is promising to facilitate more precise sensing technologies with WiFi signal.",2022-03-24T07:20:46Z,2022-03-24T07:20:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12888v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12888v1,eess.SP
Modulo Sampling of FRI Signals,"Satish Mulleti, Yonina C. Eldar","The dynamic range of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is critical during sampling of analog signals. A modulo operation prior to sampling can be used to enhance the effective dynamic range of the ADC. Further, sampling rate of ADC too plays a crucial role and it is desirable to reduce it. Finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signal model, which is ubiquitous in many applications, can be used to reduce the sampling rate. In the context of modulo folding for FRI sampling, existing works operate at a very high sampling rate compared to the rate of innovation (RoI) and require a large number of samples compared to the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the FRI signal. Moreover, these approaches use infinite length filters that are practically infeasible. We consider the FRI sampling problem with a compactly supported kernel under the modulo framework. We derive theoretical guarantees and show that FRI signals could be uniquely identified by sampling above the RoI. The number of samples for identifiability is equal to the DoF. We propose a practical algorithm to estimate the FRI parameters from the modulo samples. We show that the proposed approach has the lowest error in estimating the FRI parameters while operating with the lowest number of samples and sampling rates compared to existing techniques. The results are helpful in designing cost-effective, high-dynamic-range ADCs for FRI signals.",2022-07-18T17:32:38Z,2022-07-18T17:32:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08774v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08774v1,eess.SP
The Cramer-Rao Bound for Signal Parameter Estimation from Quantized Data,"Petre Stoica, Xiaolei Shang, Yuanbo Cheng","Several current ultra-wide band applications, such as millimeter wave radar and communication systems, require high sampling rates and therefore expensive and energy-hungry analogto-digital converters (ADCs). In applications where cost and power constraints exist, the use of high-precision ADCs is not feasible and the designer must resort to ADCs with coarse quantization. Consequently the interest in the topic of signal parameter estimation from quantized data has increased significantly in recent years. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is an important yardstick in any parameter estimation problem. Indeed it lower bounds the variance of any unbiased parameter estimator. Moreover, the CRB is an achievable limit, for instance it is asymptotically attained by the maximum likelihood estimator (under regularity conditions), and thus it is a useful benchmark to which the accuracy of any parameter estimator can and should be compared. A formula for the CRB for signal parameter estimation from real-valued quantized data has been presented in but its derivation was somewhat sketchy. The said CRB formula has been extended for instance in to complex-valued quantized data, but again its derivation was rather sketchy. The special case of binary (1-bit) ADCs and a signal consisting of one sinusoid has been thoroughly analyzed in . The CRB formula for a binary ADC and a general real-valued signal has been derived.",2022-09-27T06:40:36Z,2022-09-27T06:40:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13182v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13182v1,eess.SP
Three more Decades in Array Signal Processing Research: An Optimization   and Structure Exploitation Perspective,"Marius Pesavento, Minh Trinh-Hoang, Mats Viberg","The signal processing community currently witnesses the emergence of sensor array processing and Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in various modern applications, such as automotive radar, mobile user and millimeter wave indoor localization, drone surveillance, as well as in new paradigms, such as joint sensing and communication in future wireless systems. This trend is further enhanced by technology leaps and availability of powerful and affordable multi-antenna hardware platforms. The history of advances in super resolution DoA estimation techniques is long, starting from the early parametric multi-source methods such as the computationally expensive maximum likelihood (ML) techniques to the early subspace-based techniques such as Pisarenko and MUSIC. Inspired by the seminal review paper Two Decades of Array Signal Processing Research: The Parametric Approach by Krim and Viberg published in the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, we are looking back at another three decades in Array Signal Processing Research under the classical narrowband array processing model based on second order statistics. We revisit major trends in the field and retell the story of array signal processing from a modern optimization and structure exploitation perspective. In our overview, through prominent examples, we illustrate how different DoA estimation methods can be cast as optimization problems with side constraints originating from prior knowledge regarding the structure of the measurement system.

Pan-Tompkins++: A Robust Approach to Detect R-peaks in ECG Signals,"Naimul Khan, Md Niaz Imtiaz","R-peak detection is crucial in electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing as it is the basis of heart rate variability analysis. The Pan-Tompkins algorithm is the most widely used QRS complex detector for the monitoring of many cardiac diseases including arrhythmia detection. However, the performance of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm in detecting the QRS complexes degrades in low-quality and noisy signals. This article introduces Pan-Tompkins++, an improved Pan-Tompkins algorithm. A bandpass filter with a passband of 5--18 Hz followed by an N-point moving average filter has been applied to remove the noise without discarding the significant signal components. Pan-Tompkins++ uses three thresholds to distinguish between R-peaks and noise peaks. Rather than using a generalized equation, different rules are applied to adjust the thresholds based on the pattern of the signal for the accurate detection of R-peaks under significant changes in signal pattern. The proposed algorithm reduces the False Positive and False Negative detections, and hence improves the robustness and performance of Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Pan-Tompkins++ has been tested on four open source datasets. The experimental results show noticeable improvement for both R-peak detection and execution time. We achieve 2.8% and 1.8% reduction in FP and FN, respectively, and 2.2% increase in F-score on average across four datasets, with 33% reduction in execution time. We show specific examples to demonstrate that in situations where the Pan-Tompkins algorithm fails to identify R-peaks, the proposed algorithm is found to be effective. The results have also been contrasted with other well-known R-peak detection algorithms.

RIS-Enabled SISO Localization under User Mobility and Spatial-Wideband   Effects,"Kamran Keykhosravi, Musa Furkan Keskin, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Petar Popovski, Henk Wymeersch","Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technological enabler for the 6th generation (6G) of wireless systems with applications in localization and communication. In this paper, we consider the problem of positioning a single-antenna user in 3D space based on the received signal from a single-antenna base station and reflected signal from an RIS by taking into account the mobility of the user and spatial-wideband (WB) effects. To do so, we first derive the spatial-WB channel model under the far-field assumption, for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signal transmission with the user having a constant velocity. We derive the Cramer Rao bounds to serve as a benchmark. Furthermore, we devise a low-complexity estimator that attains the bounds in high signal-to-noise ratios. Our estimator neglects the spatial-WB effects and deals with the user mobility by estimating the radial velocities and compensating for their effects in an iterative fashion. We show that the spatial-WB effects can degrade the localization accuracy for large RIS sizes and large signal bandwidths as the direction of arrival or departure deviate from the RIS normal. In particular, for a 64X64 RIS, the proposed estimator is resilient against the spatial-WB effects up to 140 MHz bandwidth. Regarding user mobility, our results suggest that the velocity of the user influences neither the bounds nor the accuracy of our estimator. Specifically, we observe that the state of the user with a high speed (42 m/s) can be estimated virtually with the same accuracy as a static user.",2022-11-17T19:10:52Z,2022-11-17T19:10:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09844v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09844v1,eess.SP

Pilot (or reference) signals in wireless communications usually have good passive detection performance, strong anti-noise capability and good auto-correlation characteristics, hence they bear the potential for applying in radar sensing. In this paper, we investigate how to apply the positioning reference signal (PRS) of the 5th generation (5G) mobile communications in radar sensing. This approach has the unique benefit of compatibility with the most advanced mobile communication system available so far. Thus, the PRS can be regarded as a sensing reference signal to simultaneously realize the functions of radar sensing, communication and positioning in a convenient manner. Firstly, we propose a PRS based radar sensing scheme and analyze its range and velocity estimation performance, based on which we propose a method that improves the accuracy of velocity estimation by using multiple frames. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the range and velocity estimation for PRS based radar sensing and the CRLB of the range estimation for PRS based positioning are derived.

Learning-Based Reconstruction of FRI Signals,"Vincent C. H. Leung, Jun-Jie Huang, Yonina C.

This task is often translated into a spectral estimation problem that is solved using methods involving estimating signal subspaces, which tend to break down at a certain peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). To avoid this breakdown, we consider alternative approaches that make use of information from labelled data. We propose two model-based learning methods, including deep unfolding the denoising process in spectral estimation, and constructing an encoder-decoder deep neural network that models the acquisition process. Simulation results of both learning algorithms indicate significant improvements of the breakdown PSNR over classical subspace-based methods. While the deep unfolded network achieves similar performance as the classical FRI techniques and outperforms the encoder-decoder network in the low noise regimes, the latter allows to reconstruct the FRI signal even when the sampling kernel is unknown. We also achieve competitive results in detecting pulses from in vivo calcium imaging data in terms of true positive and false positive rate while providing more precise estimations.",2022-12-16T23:59:34Z,2023-07-20T11:02:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08758v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08758v2,eess.SP
Low-Complexity Blind Parameter Estimation in Wireless Systems with Noisy   Sparse Signals,"Alexandra Gallyas-Sanhueza, Christoph Studer","Baseband processing algorithms often require knowledge of the noise power, signal power, or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In practice, these parameters are typically unknown and must be estimated. Furthermore, the mean-square error (MSE) is a desirable metric to be minimized in a variety of estimation and signal recovery algorithms. However, the MSE cannot directly be used as it depends on the true signal that is generally unknown to the estimator. In this paper, we propose novel blind estimators for the average noise power, average receive signal power, SNR, and MSE. The proposed estimators can be computed at low complexity and solely rely on the large-dimensional and sparse nature of the processed data. Our estimators can be used (i) to quickly track some of the key system parameters while avoiding additional pilot overhead, (ii) to design low-complexity nonparametric algorithms that require such quantities, and (iii) to accelerate more sophisticated estimation or recovery algorithms. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the proposed estimators for a Bernoulli complex Gaussian (BCG) prior, and we demonstrate their efficacy via synthetic experiments. We also provide three application examples that deviate from the BCG prior in millimeter-wave multi-antenna and cell-free wireless systems for which we develop nonparametric denoising algorithms that improve channel-estimation accuracy with a performance comparable to denoisers that assume perfect knowledge of the system parameters.",2023-02-27T19:04:01Z,2023-03-26T19:19:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14089v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14089v2,eess.SP
"Graph Signal Processing: History, Development, Impact, and Outlook","Geert Leus, Antonio G. Marques, Jos√© M. F. Moura, Antonio Ortega, David I Shuman","Graph signal processing (GSP) generalizes signal processing (SP) tasks to signals living on non-Euclidean domains whose structure can be captured by a weighted graph. Graphs are versatile, able to model irregular interactions, easy to interpret, and endowed with a corpus of mathematical results, rendering them natural candidates to serve as the basis for a theory of processing signals in more irregular domains. In this article, we provide an overview of the evolution of GSP, from its origins to the challenges ahead. The first half is devoted to reviewing the history of GSP and explaining how it gave rise to an encompassing framework that shares multiple similarities with SP. A key message is that GSP has been critical to develop novel and technically sound tools, theory, and algorithms that, by leveraging analogies with and the insights of digital SP, provide new ways to analyze, process, and learn from graph signals. In the second half, we shift focus to review the impact of GSP on other disciplines. First, we look at the use of GSP in data science problems, including graph learning and graph-based deep learning. Second, we discuss the impact of GSP on applications, including neuroscience and image and video processing. We conclude with a brief discussion of the emerging and future directions of GSP.",2023-03-21T21:59:01Z,2023-03-21T21:59:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12211v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12211v1,eess.SP
Lie Group Algebra Convolutional Filters,"Harshat Kumar, Alejandro Parada-Mayorga, Alejandro Ribeiro","In this paper we propose a framework to leverage Lie group symmetries on arbitrary spaces exploiting \textit{algebraic signal processing} (ASP). We show that traditional group convolutions are one particular instantiation of a more general Lie group algebra homomorphism associated to an algebraic signal model rooted in the Lie group algebra $L^{1}(G)$ for given Lie group $G$. Exploiting this fact, we decouple the discretization of the Lie group convolution elucidating two separate sampling instances: the filter and the signal. To discretize the filters, we exploit the exponential map that links a Lie group with its associated Lie algebra. We show that the discrete Lie group filter learned from the data determines a unique filter in $L^{1}(G)$, and we show how this uniqueness of representation is defined by the bandwidth of the filter given a spectral representation. We also derive error bounds for the approximations of the filters in $L^{1}(G)$ with respect to its learned discrete representations. The proposed framework allows the processing of signals on spaces of arbitrary dimension and where the actions of some elements of the group are not necessarily well defined. Finally, we show that multigraph convolutional signal models come as the natural discrete realization of Lie group signal processing models, and we use this connection to establish stability results for Lie group algebra filters. To evaluate numerically our results, we build neural networks with these filters and we apply them in multiple datasets, including a knot classification problem.",2023-05-08T03:00:20Z,2024-01-26T20:47:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04431v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04431v3,eess.SP
Biophysical Model for Signal-Embedded Droplet Soaking into 2D Cell   Culture,"Ibrahim Isik, Hamidreza Arjmandi, Christophe Corre, Adam Noel","Using agar plates hosting a 2D cell population stimulated with signaling molecules is crucial for experiments such as gene regulation and drug discovery in a wide range of biological studies. In this paper, a biophysical model is proposed that incorporates droplet soaking, diffusion of molecules within agar, cell growth over an agar surface, and absorption of signaling molecules by cells. The proposed model describes the channel response and provides valuable insights for designing experiments more efficiently and accurately. The molecule release rate due to droplet soaking into agar, which is characterized and modeled as the source term for the diffusion model, is derived. Furthermore, cell growth is considered over the surface, which dictates the dynamics of signaling molecule reactions and leads to a variable boundary condition. As a case study, genetically-modified $E.\,coli$ bacteria are spread over the surface of agar and Isopropyl-beta-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is considered as a signaling molecule. IPTG droplets are dropped onto the bacteria-covered agar surface. The parameters for the IPTG molecule release rate as a diffusion source into the agar are estimated from this experiment. Then, a particle-based simulator is used to obtain the spatio-temporal profile of the signaling molecules received by the surface bacteria. The results indicate that the number of molecules reacting with or absorbed by bacteria at different locations on the surface could be widely different, which highlights the importance of taking this variation into account for biological inferences.",2023-05-10T20:13:06Z,2023-05-10T20:13:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06438v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06438v1,eess.SP
Optimum Noncoherent Detection of Constant-Envelope Signals using   Received Signal Magnitudes -- Energy Detection and Amplitude Detection,"Mu Jia, Junting Chen, Ying-Chang Liang, Pooi-Yuen Kam","Constant-envelope signals are widely employed in wireless communication systems due to their hardware-friendly design, energy efficiency, and enhanced reliability. However, detecting these signals reliably using simple, power-efficient receivers remains a critical challenge. While coherent detection methods generally offer superior performance, they require complex frequency synchronization, which increases receiver complexity and power consumption. In contrast, noncoherent detection is inherently simpler since it avoids frequency synchronization. However, traditional noncoherent detection approaches still rely on In-phase and Quadrature-phase (IQ) demodulators to extract the noisy received signal magnitudes, and assume the energy detector as the test statistic according to the IQ structure, without rigorous theoretical justification. Motivated by the practical need for robust and low-complexity detection, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework for optimal signal detection using a simple bandpass-filter envelope-detector (BFED) in conjunction with a Bayesian approach and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) under unknown amplitude conditions. By leveraging approximations of the modified Bessel functions, we derive two distinct regimes of the optimal detector. In the low SNR regime, we rigorously prove that the energy detector emerges as the Bayesian-optimal solution, thereby establishing its theoretical validity for the first time. In the high SNR regime, we derive a novel amplitude-based detector that directly compares the estimated amplitude against the noise standard deviation, leading to a simple yet optimal detection strategy. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings, confirming that both the energy and amplitude detectors achieve the minimum error probability in their respective SNR domains.",2025-02-25T06:42:13Z,2025-02-25T06:42:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17897v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17897v1,eess.SP
Micro-UAV Detection and Classification from RF Fingerprints Using   Machine Learning Techniques,"Martins Ezuma, Fatih Erden, Chethan Kumar Anjinappa, Ozgur Ozdemir, Ismail Guvenc","This paper focuses on the detection and classification of micro-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using radio frequency (RF) fingerprints of the signals transmitted from the controller to the micro-UAV. In the detection phase, raw signals are split into frames and transformed into the wavelet domain. A Markov models-based naive Bayes approach is used to check for the presence of a UAV in each frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that rely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed technique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to noise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized energy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of the raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient are detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy trajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy transient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood component analysis (NCA) to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low. Finally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for classification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database containing 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The signals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data set is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the ratio 4:1. Ten Monte Carlo simulations are run and results are averaged to assess the performance of the methods. All the micro-UAVs are detected correctly and an average accuracy of 96.3% is achieved using the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification. Proposed methods are also tested for different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and results are reported.",2019-01-23T03:14:21Z,2019-04-10T18:41:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07703v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07703v2,eess.SP
A Novel 1D Generative Adversarial Network-based Framework for Atrial   Fibrillation Detection using Restored Wrist Photoplethysmography Signals,"Faizul Rakib Sayem, Mosabber Uddin Ahmed, Saadia Binte Alam, Sakib Mahmud, Md. Mamun Sheikh, Abdulrahman Alqahtani, Md Ahasan Atick Faisal, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury","Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for AF detection, while photoplethysmography (PPG) is simple to use and appropriate for long-term monitoring. We have developed a novel approach to detect AF from smartwatch-based wrist PPG signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ 1D CycleGAN for the reconstruction of 1D wrist PPG signals, since the quality of wrist PPG signals is very poor due to motion artifacts and acquisition site limitations. Our proposed approach is validated on a dataset of 21,278 10s long wrist PPG segments. The dataset was divided into two halves and two experiments were conducted. One half was used for training and the other half for testing and vice versa. Our classification model (Self-AFNet) with 1D-CycleGAN for restoration achieves an accuracy of 96.41% and 97.09% for both splits, respectively. There is a noteworthy improvement in accuracy (2.94% and 5.08% for test splits, respectively) for restored signals as compared to unrestored PPG. AF detection task was also performed using ECG signals with the matched PPG signals to assess the validity of employing reconstructed PPG-based AF classification. Self-AFNet managed to achieve an accuracy of 98.07% and 98.97%, respectively using two ECG splits which is comparable to the performance of AF detection utilizing reconstructed PPG segments. This study reflects that reconstructed wrist PPG signals acquired from wearable devices can be used for reliable detection of atrial fibrillation, which can significantly help in the reduction of the risk of stroke.",2023-11-13T12:33:45Z,2023-12-23T10:00:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09459v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09459v3,eess.SP
"Signal detection, modularity and the correlation between extrinsic and   intrinsic noise in biochemical networks","Sorin Tanase-Nicola, Patrick B. Warren, Pieter Rein ten Wolde",Understanding cell function requires an accurate description of how noise is transmitted through biochemical networks. We present an analytical result for the power spectrum of the output signal of a biochemical network that takes into account the correlations between the noise in the input signal (the extrinsic noise) and the noise in the reactions that constitute the network (the intrinsic noise). These correlations arise from the fact that the reactions by which biochemical signals are detected necessarily affect the signaling molecules and the detection components of the network simultaneously. We show that anti-correlation between the extrinsic and intrinsic noise enhances the robustness of zero-order ultrasensitive networks to biochemical noise. We discuss the consequences of the correlation between extrinsic and intrinsic noise for a modular description of noise transmission through large biochemical networks in the context of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.,2005-08-20T17:19:44Z,2006-03-22T17:31:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0508027v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0508027v2,q-bio.MN
Principles of microRNA regulation of a human cellular signaling network,"Qinghua Cui, Zhenbao Yu, Enrico O. Purisima, Edwin Wang","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 22-nucleotide RNAs, which suppress gene expression by selectively binding to the 3-noncoding region of specific message RNAs through base-pairing. Given the diversity and abundance of miRNA targets, miRNAs appear to functionally interact with various components of many cellular networks. By analyzing the interactions between miRNAs and a human cellular signaling network, we found that miRNAs predominantly target positive regulatory motifs, highly connected scaffolds and most downstream network components such as signaling transcription factors, but less frequently target negative regulatory motifs, common components of basic cellular machines and most upstream network components such as ligands. In addition, when an adaptor has potential to recruit more downstream components, these components are more frequently targeted by miRNAs. This work uncovers the principles of miRNA regulation of signal transduction networks and implies a potential function of miRNAs for facilitating robust transitions of cellular response to extracellular signals and maintaining cellular homeostasis.",2006-12-18T03:17:11Z,2006-12-18T03:17:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0612034v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0612034v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.GN"

Integration of a Phosphatase Cascade with the MAP Kinase Pathway   provides for a Novel Signal Processing Function,"Virendra K. Chaudhri, Dhiraj Kumar, Manjari Misra, Raina Dua, Kanury V. S. Rao","We mathematically modeled the receptor-activated MAP kinase signaling by incorporating the regulation through cellular phosphatases. Activation induced the alignment of a phosphatase cascade in parallel with the MAP kinase pathway. A novel regulatory motif was thus generated, providing for the combinatorial control of each MAPK intermediate. This ensured a non-linear mode of signal transmission with the output being shaped by the balance between the strength of input signal, and the activity gradient along the phosphatase axis. Shifts in this balance yielded modulations in topology of the motif, thereby expanding the repertoire of output responses. Thus we identify an added dimension to signal processing, wherein the output response to an external stimulus is additionally filtered through indicators that define the phenotypic status of the cell.",2009-08-11T15:34:41Z,2009-08-11T15:34:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1515v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1515v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.OT"

Integrin signaling has been studied extensively and much data is available on pathway components and interactions. Yet the data is fragmented and an integrated model is missing. We use a rule-based modeling approach to integrate available data and test biological hypotheses regarding the role of talin, Dok1 and PIPKI in integrin activation. The detailed biochemical characterization of integrin signaling provides us with measured values for most of the kinetics parameters. However, measurements are not fully accurate and the cellular concentrations of signaling proteins are largely unknown and expected to vary substantially across different cellular conditions. By sampling model behaviors over the physiologically realistic parameter range we find that the model exhibits only two different qualitative behaviours and these depend mainly on the relative protein concentrations, which offers a powerful point of control to the cell.

The spatial structure of cell signaling systems,Ruth Nussinov,"The spatial structure of the cell is highly organized at all levels: from small complexes and assemblies, to local nano- and micro-clusters, to global, micrometer scales across and between cells. We suggest that this multiscale spatial cell organization also organizes signaling and coordinates cellular behavior. We propose a new view of the spatial structure of cell signaling systems. This new view describes cell signaling in terms of dynamic allosteric interactions within and among distinct, spatially organized transient clusters. The clusters vary over time and space and are on length scales from nanometers to micrometers. When considered across these length-scales, primary factors in the spatial organization are cell membrane domains and the actin cytoskeleton, both also highly dynamic. A key challenge is to understand the interplay across these multiple scales, link it to the physicochemical basis of the conformational behavior of single molecules, and ultimately relate it to cellular function. Overall, our premise is that at these scales, cell signaling should be thought of not primarily as a sequence of diffusion-controlled molecular collisions, but instead transient, allostery-driven cluster re-forming interactions.",2013-08-03T14:09:42Z,2013-08-03T14:09:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0699v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0699v1,"q-bio.BM, q-bio.MN"

The environment offers core functionalities for the tissue and signalling models. In addition, the software offers great flexibility to add custom extensions and biologically motivated processes. Cells are represented as highly resolved, massless elastic polygons; the viscous properties of the tissue are modelled by a Newtonian fluid.

The frequency of those oscillations are related to the brain functions. However, little is know about how the oscillating frequency of neural system affects neural information transmission in them. In this paper, we investigated how the signal processing in single neuron is modulated by subthreshold membrane potential oscillation generated by upstream rhythmic neural activities. We found that the high frequency oscillations facilitate the transferring of strong signals, whereas slow oscillations the weak signals. Though the capacity of information convey for weak signal is low in single neuron, it is greatly enhanced when weak signals are transferred by multiple pathways with different oscillation phases. We provided a simple phase plane analysis to explain the mechanism for this stimulus-dependent frequency modulation in the leakage integrate-and-fire neuron model.

We showed that the channel capacities of individual steps in a given general model cascade were equivalent in an independent manner, and were given by the entropy production rate. Signal transduction was transmitted by fluctuation of the entropy production rate and quantified transduction was estimated by the work done in individual steps. If the individual step representing the modification to demodification of the signal molecules is considered to be a Szilard engine, the maximal work done is equivalent to the chemical potential change of the messenger that is consumed during the modification reaction. Our method was applicable to calculate the channel capacity of the MAPK cascade.

A Review of Noise Cancellation Techniques for Cognitive Radio,Adnan Quadri,"One of the fundamental challenges affecting the performance of communication systems is the undesired impact of noise on a signal. Noise distorts the signal and originates due to several sources including, system non-linearity and noise interference from adjacent environment. Conventional communication systems use filters to cancel noise in a received signal. In the case of cognitive radio systems, denoising a signal is important during the spectrum sensing period, and also during communication with other network nodes. Based on our findings, few surveys are found that only review particular denoising techniques employed for the spectrum sensing phase of cognitive radio communication. This paper aims to provide a collective review of denoising techniques that can be applied to a cognitive radio system during all the phases of cognitive communication and discusses several works where the denoising techniques are employed.

Second, the time/space resolution of these techniques should be high enough to assess the dynamics of identified networks. Emerging evidence suggests that Electroencephalography (EEG) source connectivity method may offer solutions to both issues provided that scalp EEG signals are appropriately processed. Therefore, the performance of EEG source connectivity method strongly depends on signal processing (SP) that involves various methods such as preprocessing techniques, inverse solutions, statistical couplings between signals and network science. The main objective of this tutorial-like review is to provide an overview on EEG source connectivity. We describe the major contributions that the SP community brought to this research field.

Receiver perception is assumed to influence preference and thus the evolution of signal design, but evolutionary biologists still struggle to understand how perception, preference, and signal design are mechanistically linked. In parallel, the field of empirical aesthetics aims to understand why people like some designs more than others. The model of processing bias discussed here is rooted in empirical aesthetics, which posits that preferences are influenced by the emotional system as it monitors the dynamics of information processing, and that attractive signals have either effective designs that maximize information transmission, efficient designs that allow information processing at low metabolic cost, or both. We refer to the causal link between preference and the emotionally rewarding experience of effective and efficient information processing as the processing bias, and we apply it to the evolutionary model of sensory drive.

Direct Reconstruction of Distorted Signals and Images Using Shifts   Methods,Andrey V. Novikov-Borodin,"Mathematical methods of step-by-step and combined shifts are proposed for experimental data processing to reconstruct the measuring system impulse response distorted by shift-invariant blur. Proposed methods base on direct non-blind deconvolution without using approximations and integral transforms. Methods are fast and effective for accurate data reconstruction, which gives a possibility of increasing the effective resolution of measuring systems by mathematical methods up to physical limits without solving the expensive and quite difficult scientific and technical problems. Step-by-step and combined shifts methods supplement each other in data reconstruction at different distortions of signals, noise levels and data volumes. Methods may be adapted for reconstruction of multi-dimensional data. There are considered the restorations of 2D images blurred by uniform motion and distorted by functions, which may be factored, such as Gaussian-like functions. The comparative analysis of step-by-step and combined shifts methods is presented. Reconstruction inaccuracies are estimated.

Active Sampling for Approximately Bandlimited Graph Signals,"Sijie Lin, Xuan Xie, Hui Feng, Bo Hu","This paper investigates the active sampling for estimation of approximately bandlimited graph signals. With the assistance of a graph filter, an approximately bandlimited graph signal can be formulated by a Gaussian random field over the graph. In contrast to offline sampling set design methods which usually rely on accurate prior knowledge about the model, unknown parameters in signal and noise distribution are allowed in the proposed active sampling algorithm. The active sampling process is divided into two alternating stages: unknown parameters are first estimated by Expectation Maximization (EM), with which the next node to sample is selected based on historical observations according to predictive uncertainty. Validated by simulations compared with related approaches, the proposed algorithm can reduce the sample size to reach a certain estimation accuracy.",2019-02-12T07:40:14Z,2019-02-16T14:38:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04265v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04265v2,eess.SP

For portable systems, such as prosthetic limbs, real-time low-power operation on embedded processors is critical, but to date, there has been no record of how existing EMG analysis approaches support such deployments. This paper presents a novel approach to time-domain classification of multi-channel EMG signals harnessed from randomly-placed sensors according to the wrist-hand movements which caused their occurrence. It shows how, by employing a very small set of time-domain features, Kernel Fisher discriminant feature projection and Radial Bias Function neural network classifiers, nine wrist-hand movements can be detected with accuracy exceeding 99% - surpassing the state-of-the-art on record.

Dynamic Weight Importance Sampling for Low Cost Spatiotemporal Sensing,Hadi Alasti,"A simple and low cost dynamic weight importance sampling (DWIS) implementation is presented and discussed for spatiotemporal sensing of unknown correlated signals in sensor field. The spatial signal is compressed into its contour lines and a partitioned subset of sensors that their observations are in a given margin of the contour levels, is used for importance sampling. The selected sensor population is changed dynamically to maintain the low cost and acceptable spatial signal estimation from limited observations. The estimation performance, cost and convergence of the proposed approach is evaluated for spatial and temporal monitoring, using three different contour level definition schemes. The results show that using DWIS and modeling the spatial signal with contour lines is low cost. In this study the presence of noise in sensor observations is ignored. The number of participant sensors is taken as modeling cost.",2019-08-22T04:11:46Z,2019-08-22T04:11:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08193v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08193v1,eess.SP
Deep Modulation (Deepmod): A Self-Taught PHY Layer for Resilient Digital   Communications,"Adam Anderson, Steven R. Young, F. Kyle Reed, Jason M. Vann","Traditional physical (PHY) layer protocols contain chains of signal processing blocks that have been mathematically optimized to transmit information bits efficiently over noisy channels. Unfortunately, this same optimality encourages ubiquity in wireless communication technology and enhances the potential for catastrophic cyber or physical attacks due to prolific knowledge of underlying physical layers. Additionally, optimal signal processing for one channel medium may not work for another without significant changes in the software protocol. Any truly resilient communications protocol must be capable of immediate redeployment to meet quality of service (QoS) demands in a wide variety of possible channel media. Contrary to many traditional approaches which use immutable man-made signal processing blocks, this work proposes generating real-time blocks {\it ad hoc} through a machine learning framework, so-called deepmod, that is only relevant to the particular channel medium being used. With this approach, traditional signal processing blocks are replaced with machine learning graphs which are trained, used, and discarded as needed. Our experiments show that deepmod, using the same machine intelligence, converges to viable communication links over vastly different channels including: radio frequency (RF), powerline communications (PLC), and acoustic channels.",2019-08-29T13:38:07Z,2019-08-29T13:38:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11218v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11218v1,eess.SP

In this paper, we show how to optimally combine the V and H dipole outputs and demonstrate that an equalizer operating on this optimally-combined signal outperforms an equalizer operating on the RHCP, LHCP, or the combined signals.

Enhancing Geometric Deep Learning via Graph Filter Deconvolution,"Jingkang Yang, Santiago Segarra","In this paper, we incorporate a graph filter deconvolution step into the classical geometric convolutional neural network pipeline. More precisely, under the assumption that the graph domain plays a role in the generation of the observed graph signals, we pre-process every signal by passing it through a sparse deconvolution operation governed by a pre-specified filter bank. This deconvolution operation is formulated as a group-sparse recovery problem, and convex relaxations that can be solved efficiently are put forth. The deconvolved signals are then fed into the geometric convolutional neural network, yielding better classification performance than their unprocessed counterparts. Numerical experiments showcase the effectiveness of the deconvolution step on classification tasks on both synthetic and real-world settings.",2018-09-24T03:23:24Z,2018-09-24T03:23:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00661v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00661v1,eess.SP
Variations on the CSC model,"Ives Rey-Otero, Jeremias Sulam, Michael Elad","Over the past decade, the celebrated sparse representation model has achieved impressive results in various signal and image processing tasks. A convolutional version of this model, termed convolutional sparse coding (CSC), has been recently reintroduced and extensively studied. CSC brings a natural remedy to the limitation of typical sparse enforcing approaches of handling global and high-dimensional signals by local, patch-based, processing. While the classic field of sparse representations has been able to cater for the diverse challenges of different signal processing tasks by considering a wide range of problem formulations, almost all available algorithms that deploy the CSC model consider the same $\ell_1 - \ell_2$ problem form. As we argue in this paper, this CSC pursuit formulation is also too restrictive as it fails to explicitly exploit some local characteristics of the signal. This work expands the range of formulations for the CSC model by proposing two convex alternatives that merge global norms with local penalties and constraints. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of efficient and provably converging algorithms to solve these new sparse coding formulations.",2018-10-02T11:06:06Z,2018-10-02T11:06:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01169v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01169v1,eess.SP

We also derive approximate detectors of reduced computation complexity and without noticeable performance degradation. Simulation results reveal a clear improvement of the detection probability for the proposed techniques with respect to the conventional detectors implemented in high sensitivity GNSS (HS-GNSS) receivers to acquire weak GNSS signals.

Instantaneous frequency estimation using the discrete linear chirp   transform and the Wigner distribution,"Osama A. Alkishriwo, Luis F. Chaparro","In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate instantaneous frequency using a combined approach based on the discrete linear chirp transform (DLCT) and the Wigner distribution (WD). The DLCT locally represents a signal as a superposition of linear chirps while the WD provides maximum energy concentration along the instantaneous frequency in the time-frequency domain for each of the chirps. The developed approach takes advantage of the separation of the linear chirps given by the DLCT, and that for each of them, the WD provides an ideal representation. Combining the WD of the linear chirp components, we obtain a time-frequency representation free of cross-terms that clearly displays the instantaneous frequency. Applying this procedure locally, we obtain an instantaneous frequency estimate of a non-stationary multicomponent signal. The proposed method is illustrated by simulation. The results indicate the method is efficient for the instantaneous frequency estimation of multicomponent signals embedded in noise, even in cases of low signal to noise ratio.",2018-10-11T22:07:06Z,2018-10-11T22:07:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05269v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05269v1,eess.SP
Low-complexity Graph Sampling with Noise and Signal Reconstruction via   Neumann Series,"Fen Wang, Gene Cheung, Yongchao Wang","Graph sampling addresses the problem of selecting a node subset in a graph to collect samples, so that a K-bandlimited signal can be reconstructed in high fidelity. Assuming an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise model, minimizing the expected mean square error (MMSE) leads to the known A-optimality criterion for graph sampling, which is expensive to compute and difficult to optimize. In this paper, we propose an augmented objective based on Neumann series that well approximates the original criterion and is amenable to greedy optimization. Specifically, we show that a shifted A-optimal criterion can be equivalently written as a function of an ideal low-pass (LP) graph filter, which in turn can be approximated efficiently via fast graph Fourier transform (FGFT). Minimizing the new objective, we select nodes greedily without large matrix inversions using a matrix inverse lemma. Further, for the dynamic network case where node availability varies across time, we propose an extended sampling strategy that replaces offline samples one-by-one in the selected set. For signal reconstruction, we propose an accompanied biased signal recovery strategy that reuses the approximated filter from sampling. Experiments show that our reconstruction is more robust to large noise than the least square (LS) solution, and our sampling strategy far outperforms several existing schemes.",2018-12-05T16:58:31Z,2018-12-05T16:58:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02109v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02109v1,eess.SP
Location-free Spectrum Cartography,"Yves Teganya, Daniel Romero, Luis Miguel Lopez Ramos, Baltasar Beferull-Lozano","Spectrum cartography constructs maps of metrics such as channel gain or received signal power across a geographic area of interest using spatially distributed sensor measurements. Applications of these maps include network planning, interference coordination, power control, localization, and cognitive radios to name a few. Since existing spectrum cartography techniques require accurate estimates of the sensor locations, their performance is drastically impaired by multipath affecting the positioning pilot signals, as occurs in indoor or dense urban scenarios. To overcome such a limitation, this paper introduces a novel paradigm for spectrum cartography, where estimation of spectral maps relies on features of these positioning signals rather than on location estimates. Specific learning algorithms are built upon this approach and offer a markedly improved estimation performance than existing approaches relying on localization, as demonstrated by simulation studies in indoor scenarios.",2018-12-30T14:17:48Z,2019-05-09T12:44:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11539v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11539v2,eess.SP
Analysis of Channel Model for LAA-WLAN Coexistence with different OFDM   Parameters between LAA and Wi-Fi,"Harim Lee, Hyun Jong Yang","In this work, the channel model for the asynchronous Wi-Fi and LAA signals is investigated, also taking into consideration the impairment of the OFDM parameters between LAA and Wi-Fi. Even for the same bandwidth, e.g., 20 MHz channel, OFDM parameters of LAA-LTE and Wi-Fi are different [1], [2]. In addition, the legacy Wi-Fi devices cannot receive or transmit synchronously with LAA-LTE. Thus, the orthogonality between the subcarriers is broken if LAA-LTE's signals are received at Wi-Fi devices and vice versa. In order to facilitate an analysis of the throughput, we should derive the distortion of LAA-LTE's signals received at Wi-Fi devices and the distortion of Wi-Fi's signals received at LAA-LTE devices due to the difference in OFDM parameters of LAA-LTE and Wi-Fi.",2019-04-08T06:50:11Z,2019-04-08T06:50:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03864v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03864v1,eess.SP

For WB spectrum acquisition, Nyquist rate sampling is required at the receiver's analog-to-digital converter (ADC), hence we use compressed sensing (CS) theory to alleviate such high rate sampling requirement at the receiver ADC. From the estimated WB spectrum, we then extract various spectral features of each of the NB signal. These features are then used to train and classify each NB signal into its respective modulation using the random forest classifier. In the end, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm under different empirical setups and verify its superior performance in comparison to a recently proposed signal classification algorithm.",2019-04-12T16:58:05Z,2019-04-12T16:58:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06322v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06322v1,eess.SP

In fact, without utilizing a suitable whitening algorithm, the input signals are very similar to one another. Therefore, conventional approaches are not able to identify and properly discriminate desired buried objects. A suitable whitening algorithm makes the covariance matrix diagonal, such that the processed signals highly resembles the unprocessed versions. Such a similarity would be helpful to identify new received signal. In this study, we have employed the zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) as our whitening method. Hence, although signals of different targets are very similar in many cases, the mentioned advantages, achieved by whitening method, make identification of targets much easier.",2019-10-16T06:09:04Z,2019-10-16T06:09:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07180v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07180v1,eess.SP

Modified Computation of Correlation Integral for Analyzing Epileptic   Signals,"Prajna Upadhyaya, Tohru Yagi","Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. One method for analyzing seizure activity is to compute the correlation dimension of time-series electroencephalographic signals. The Grasserberg and Proccacia algorithm is commonly used to compute this correlation dimension. The algorithm uses the Heaviside function to determine the correlation integral by counting the number of distances between vectors (d_ij) that are greater than a threshold. However, information about the chaotic nature of the signal is not completely retained by this function. In this work, instead of using the Heaviside function, we calculated the correlation integral by using an exponential function of d_ij. Greater sensitivity to the interictal and ictal signals using this modified algorithm was verified using three datasets. Comparing heatmaps of d_ij obtained using the original and modified methods showed additional information that was retained with the new algorithm.",2019-12-12T09:13:50Z,2019-12-12T09:13:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05841v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05841v1,"eess.SP, q-bio.NC"

Estimation and uncertainty quantification for piecewise smooth signal   recovery,"Victor Churchill, Anne Gelb","This paper presents a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm for linear inverse problems with a high order total variation (HOTV) sparsity prior. For the problem of sparse signal recovery, SBL often produces more accurate estimates than maximum a posteriori estimates, including those that rely on l1 regularization. Moreover, rather than a single signal estimate, SBL yields a full posterior density estimate which can be used for uncertainty quantification. However, SBL is only immediately applicable to problems having a direct sparsity prior, or to those that can be formed via synthesis. This paper demonstrates how a problem with an HOTV sparsity prior can be formulated via synthesis, and then develops a corresponding Bayesian learning method. This expands the class of problems available to Bayesian learning to include, e.g., inverse problems dealing with the recovery of piecewise smooth functions or signals from data.

Grid-GSP provides an interpretation for the spatio-temporal properties of voltage phasor measurements, by showing how the well-known power systems modeling supports a generative low-pass graph filter model for the state variables, namely the voltage phasors. Using the model we formalize the empirical observation that voltage phasor measurement data lie in a low-dimensional subspace and tie their spatio-temporal structure to generator voltage dynamics. The Grid-GSP generative model is then successfully employed to investigate the problems pertaining to the grid of data sampling and interpolation, network inference, detection of anomalies and data compression.

Reconstructing Classes of Non-bandlimited Signals from Time Encoded   Information,"Roxana Alexandru, Pier Luigi Dragotti","We investigate time encoding as an alternative method to classical sampling, and address the problem of reconstructing classes of non-bandlimited signals from time-based samples. We consider a sampling mechanism based on first filtering the input, before obtaining the timing information using a time encoding machine. Within this framework, we show that sampling by timing is equivalent to a non-uniform sampling problem, where the reconstruction of the input depends on the characteristics of the filter and on its non-uniform shifts. The classes of filters we focus on are exponential and polynomial splines, and we show that their fundamental properties are locally preserved in the context of non-uniform sampling. Leveraging these properties, we then derive sufficient conditions and propose novel algorithms for perfect reconstruction of classes of non-bandlimited signals such as: streams of Diracs, sequences of pulses and piecewise constant signals. Next, we extend these methods to operate with arbitrary filters, and also present simulation results on synthetic noisy data.",2019-05-08T16:11:02Z,2019-12-16T14:58:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03183v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03183v3,eess.SP
An Introduction to Rule-based Modeling of Immune Receptor Signaling,"John A. P. Sekar, James R. Faeder","Cells process external and internal signals through chemical interactions. Cells that constitute the immune system (e.g., antigen presenting cell, T-cell, B-cell, mast cell) can have different functions (e.g., adaptive memory, inflammatory response) depending on the type and number of receptor molecules on the cell surface and the specific intracellular signaling pathways activated by those receptors. Explicitly modeling and simulating kinetic interactions between molecules allows us to pose questions about the dynamics of a signaling network under various conditions. However, the application of chemical kinetics to biochemical signaling systems has been limited by the complexity of the systems under consideration. Rule-based modeling (BioNetGen, Kappa, Simmune, PySB) is an approach to address this complexity. In this chapter, by application to the Fc$\varepsilon$RI receptor system, we will explore the origins of complexity in macromolecular interactions, show how rule-based modeling can be used to address complexity, and demonstrate how to build a model in the BioNetGen framework.

A complete framework for linear filtering of bivariate signals,"Julien Flamant, Pierre Chainais, Nicolas Le Bihan","A complete framework for the linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering theory of bivariate signals is proposed based on a tailored quaternion Fourier transform. This framework features a direct description of LTI filters in terms of their eigenproperties enabling compact calculus and physically interpretable filtering relations in the frequency domain. The design of filters exhibiting fondamental properties of polarization optics (birefringence, diattenuation) is straightforward. It yields an efficient spectral synthesis method and new insights on Wiener filtering for bivariate signals with prescribed frequency-dependent polarization properties. This generic framework facilitates original descriptions of bivariate signals in two components with specific geometric or statistical properties. Numerical experiments support our theoretical analysis and illustrate the relevance of the approach on synthetic data.",2018-02-07T15:14:55Z,2018-02-07T15:14:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02469v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02469v1,eess.SP
Dynamic Signal Measurements Based on Quantized Data,"Paolo Carbone, Johan Schuokens, Antonio Moschitta","The estimation of the parameters of a dynamic signal, such as a sine wave, based on quantized data is customarily performed using the least-square estimator (LSE), such as the sine fit. However, the characteristics of the experiments and the measurement setup hardly satisfy the requirements ensuring the LSE to be optimal in the minimum mean-square-error sense. This occurs if the input signal is characterized by a large signal-to-noise ratio resulting in the deterministic component of the quantization error dominating the random error component and when the ADC transition levels are not uniformly distributed over the quantizer input range. In this paper, it is first shown that the LSE applied to quantized data does not perform as expected when the quantizer is not uniform. Then, an estimator is introduced that overcomes these limitations. It uses the values of the transition levels so that a prior quantizer calibration phase is necessary. The estimator properties are analyzed and both numerical and experimental results are described to illustrate its performance. It is shown that the described estimator outperforms the LSE and it also provides an estimate of the probability distribution function of the noise before quantization.",2018-04-26T12:50:37Z,2018-04-26T12:50:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10027v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10027v1,eess.SP
SAIFE: Unsupervised Wireless Spectrum Anomaly Detection with   Interpretable Features,"Sreeraj Rajendran, Wannes Meert, Vincent Lenders, Sofie Pollin","Detecting anomalous behavior in wireless spectrum is a demanding task due to the sheer complexity of the electromagnetic spectrum use. Wireless spectrum anomalies can take a wide range of forms from the presence of an unwanted signal in a licensed band to the absence of an expected signal, which makes manual labeling of anomalies difficult and suboptimal. We present, Spectrum Anomaly Detector with Interpretable FEatures (SAIFE), an Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) based anomaly detector for wireless spectrum anomaly detection using Power Spectral Density (PSD) data which achieves good anomaly detection and localization in an unsupervised setting. In addition, we investigate the model's capabilities to learn interpretable features such as signal bandwidth, class and center frequency in a semi-supervised fashion. Along with anomaly detection the model exhibits promising results for lossy PSD data compression up to 120X and semisupervised signal classification accuracy close to 100% on three datasets just using 20% labeled samples.

Blue-Noise Sampling on Graphs,"Alejandro Parada-Mayorga, Daniel L. Lau, Jhony H. Giraldo, Gonzalo R. Arce","In the area of graph signal processing, a graph is a set of nodes arbitrarily connected by weighted links; a graph signal is a set of scalar values associated with each node; and sampling is the problem of selecting an optimal subset of nodes from which a graph signal can be reconstructed. This paper proposes the use of spatial dithering on the vertex domain of the graph, as a way to conveniently find statistically good sampling sets. This is done establishing that there is a family of good sampling sets characterized on the vertex domain by a maximization of the distance between sampling nodes; in the Fourier domain, these are characterized by spectrums that are dominated by high frequencies referred to as blue-noise. The theoretical connection between blue-noise sampling on graphs and previous results in graph signal processing is also established, explaining the advantages of the proposed approach. Restricting our analysis to undirected and connected graphs, numerical tests are performed in order to compare the effectiveness of blue-noise sampling against other approaches.",2018-11-29T23:52:55Z,2019-05-23T19:18:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12542v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12542v4,eess.SP

The symbol packing rartio is a vital parameter to obtain the real symbol rate and recover the origin symbols from the received symbols by calculating the intersymbol interference (ISI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effective estimation approach for symbol packing rartio in FTN signaling and has shown its fast convergence and robustness to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by numerical simulations. Benefiting from the proposed blind estimation, the packing-ratio-based adaptive FTN transmission without dedicate channel or control frame becomes available.

In this paper, we will look at one of the main tasks of modern signal processing, namely, at analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion in connection with a simple manifold model - the circle. We will focus on Sigma-Delta modulation which is a popular method for A/D conversion of bandlimited signals that employs coarse quantization coupled with oversampling. Classical Sigma-Delta schemes provide mismatches and large errors at the initialization point if the signal to be converted is defined on the circle. In this paper, our goal is to get around these problems for Sigma-Delta schemes.

Generative Adversarial Networks For Graph Data Imputation From Signed   Observations,"Amarlingam Madapu, Santiago Segarra, Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri, Antonio G.

More precisely, we consider that the true graph data is drawn from a distribution of signals that are smooth or bandlimited on a known graph. However, instead of observing these signals, we observe a signed version of them and only at a subset of the nodes on the graph. Our goal is to estimate the true underlying graph signals from our observations. To achieve this, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) where the key is to incorporate graph-aware losses in the associated minimax optimization problem.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for target parameter estimation in cases where one-bit analog-to-digital-converters (ADCs), also known as signal comparators with time-varying thresholds, are employed to sample the received radar signal instead of high-resolution ADCs. The considered problem has potential applications in the design of inexpensive radar and sensing devices in civilian applications, and can likely pave the way for future radar systems employing low-resolution ADCs for faster sampling and high-resolution target determination. We formulate the target estimation as a multivariate weighted-least-squares optimization problem that can be solved in a cyclic manner.

Audio Codec Enhancement with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Arijit Biswas, Dai Jia","Audio codecs are typically transform-domain based and efficiently code stationary audio signals, but they struggle with speech and signals containing dense transient events such as applause. Specifically, with these two classes of signals as examples, we demonstrate a technique for restoring audio from coding noise based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). A primary advantage of the proposed GAN-based coded audio enhancer is that the method operates end-to-end directly on decoded audio samples, eliminating the need to design any manually-crafted frontend. Furthermore, the enhancement approach described in this paper can improve the sound quality of low-bit rate coded audio without any modifications to the existent standard-compliant encoders. Subjective tests illustrate that the proposed enhancer improves the quality of speech and difficult to code applause excerpts significantly.",2020-01-27T09:50:36Z,2020-01-27T09:50:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09653v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09653v1,"eess.AS, eess.SP"
Performance Analysis and Optimization of 3D Massive MIMO Multi-Pair   Relaying with SWIPT,"Samira Rahimian, Yindi Jing, Masoud Ardakani","In this paper, we study a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) relay network where multiple source-destination pairs exchange information through a common relay equipped with a massive antenna array. The source users perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and the power-splitting (PS) scheme is used at the relay to first harvest energy from the received signals, and then, to transmit the decoded signals using the harvested energy. Relay performs maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) beam-forming on the received signal. Under the three-dimensional (3D) directional channel model, we derive a closed-form lower bound expression for the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio using results from random matrix theory, which leads to an asymptotic approximation of the achievable sum-rate. Based on that, we study a joint optimization problem over the tilt and PS ratio to maximize the achievable sum-rate. Grid search algorithm is used to solve the non-convex problem.

Unlike in mobile communication systems, the literature for radar systems did not adequately address inter-radar interference and security threats such as jamming and spoofing, which in turn threatens the traffic safety. In this context, we introduce a novel frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar scheme (namely, BlueFMCW) that mitigates both interference and spoofing signals. BlueFMCW randomly hops frequency to avoid interference and spoofing signals.

When Probabilistic Shaping Realizes Improper Signaling for Hardware   Distortion Mitigation,"Sidrah Javed, Ahmed Elzanaty, Osama Amin, Basem Shihada, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","Hardware distortions (HWD) render drastic effects on the performance of communication systems. They are recently proven to bear asymmetric signatures; and hence can be efficiently mitigated using improper Gaussian signaling (IGS), thanks to its additional design degrees of freedom. Discrete asymmetric signaling (AS) can practically realize the IGS by shaping the signals' geometry or probability. In this paper, we adopt the probabilistic shaping (PS) instead of uniform symbols to mitigate the impact of HWD and derive the optimal maximum a posterior detector. Then, we design the symbols' probabilities to minimize the error rate performance while accommodating the improper nature of HWD. Although the design problem is a non-convex optimization problem, we simplified it using successive convex programming and propose an iterative algorithm. We further present a hybrid shaping (HS) design to gain the combined benefits of both PS and geometric shaping (GS). Finally, extensive numerical results and Monte-Carlo simulations highlight the superiority of the proposed PS over conventional uniform constellation and GS. Both PS and HS achieve substantial improvements over the traditional uniform constellation and GS with up to one order magnitude in error probability and throughput.",2020-09-11T16:17:00Z,2020-09-11T16:17:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05510v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05510v1,eess.SP

Distortion-controlled Training for End-to-end Reverberant Speech   Separation with Auxiliary Autoencoding Loss,"Yi Luo, Cong Han, Nima Mesgarani","The performance of speech enhancement and separation systems in anechoic environments has been significantly advanced with the recent progress in end-to-end neural network architectures. However, the performance of such systems in reverberant environments is yet to be explored. A core problem in reverberant speech separation is about the training and evaluation metrics. Standard time-domain metrics may introduce unexpected distortions during training and fail to properly evaluate the separation performance due to the presence of the reverberations. In this paper, we first introduce the ""equal-valued contour"" problem in reverberant separation where multiple outputs can lead to the same performance measured by the common metrics. We then investigate how ""better"" outputs with lower target-specific distortions can be selected by auxiliary autoencoding training (A2T). A2T assumes that the separation is done by a linear operation on the mixture signal, and it adds an loss term on the autoencoding of the direct-path target signals to ensure that the distortion introduced on the direct-path signals is controlled during separation. Evaluations on separation signal quality and speech recognition accuracy show that A2T is able to control the distortion on the direct-path signals and improve the recognition accuracy.",2020-11-14T17:03:22Z,2020-11-14T17:03:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07338v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07338v1,eess.AS

In particular, we present a new requirement about the lower bound of sampling rate to ensure exact recovery of original signals from quantized modulo samples. The minimum sampling rate is jointly determined by signal bandwidth and quantization bits. Numerical results show that in the presence of quantization noise, signals with different waveforms and bandwidths are recovered perfectly at the new minimum sampling rate while the recovery fails at minimum sampling rate before modification, which also verifies the correctness of the theory.

Identifying First-order Lowpass Graph Signals using Perron Frobenius   Theorem,"Yiran He, Hoi-To Wai","This paper is concerned with the blind identification of graph filters from graph signals. Our aim is to determine if the graph filter generating the graph signals is first-order lowpass without knowing the graph topology. Notice that lowpass graph filter is a common prerequisite for applying graph signal processing tools for sampling, denoising, and graph learning. Our method is inspired by the Perron Frobenius theorem, which observes that for first-order lowpass graph filter, the top eigenvector of output covariance would be the only eigenvector with elements of the same sign. Utilizing this observation, we develop a simple detector that answers if a given data set is produced by a first-order lowpass graph filter. We analyze the effects of finite-sample, graph size, observation noise, strength of lowpass filter, on the detector's performance. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data support our findings.",2021-01-20T02:50:57Z,2021-01-20T02:50:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07938v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07938v1,eess.SP
Fast & Robust Image Interpolation using Gradient Graph Laplacian   Regularizer,"Fei Chen, Gene Cheung, Xue Zhang","In the graph signal processing (GSP) literature, it has been shown that signal-dependent graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) can efficiently promote piecewise constant (PWC) signal reconstruction for various image restoration tasks. However, for planar image patches, like total variation (TV), GLR may suffer from the well-known ""staircase"" effect. To remedy this problem, we generalize GLR to gradient graph Laplacian regularizer (GGLR) that provably promotes piecewise planar (PWP) signal reconstruction for the image interpolation problem -- a 2D grid with random missing pixels that requires completion. Specifically, we first construct two higher-order gradient graphs to connect local horizontal and vertical gradients. Each local gradient is estimated using structure tensor, which is robust using known pixels in a small neighborhood, mitigating the problem of larger noise variance when computing gradient of gradients. Moreover, unlike total generalized variation (TGV), GGLR retains the quadratic form of GLR, leading to an unconstrained quadratic programming (QP) problem per iteration that can be solved quickly using conjugate gradient (CG). We derive the means-square-error minimizing weight parameter for GGLR, trading off bias and variance of the signal estimate. Experiments show that GGLR outperformed competing schemes in interpolation quality for severely damaged images at a reduced complexity.",2021-01-25T08:32:13Z,2021-06-18T01:50:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09951v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09951v2,eess.IV
Fundamental Performance Limits on Terahertz Wireless Links Imposed by   Group Velocity Dispersion,"Karl Strecker, Sabit Ekin, John OHara","A theoretical framework and numerical simulations quantifying the impact of atmospheric group velocity dispersion on wireless terahertz communication link error rate were developed based upon experimental work. We present, for the first time, predictions of symbol error rate as a function of link distance, signal bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and atmospheric conditions, revealing that long-distance, broadband terahertz communication systems may be limited by inter-symbol interference stemming from group velocity dispersion, rather than attenuation. In such dispersion limited links, increasing signal strength does not improve the symbol error rate and, consequently, theoretical predictions of symbol error rate based only on signal-to-noise ratio are invalid for the broadband case. This work establishes a new and necessary foundation for link budget analysis in future long-distance terahertz communication systems that accounts for the non-negligible effects of both attenuation and dispersion.",2021-04-01T16:43:59Z,2021-04-26T15:43:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00611v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00611v2,eess.SP
Newton-Type Optimal Thresholding Algorithms for Sparse Optimization   Problems,"Nan Meng, Yun-Bin Zhao","Sparse signals can be possibly reconstructed by an algorithm which merges a traditional nonlinear optimization method and a certain thresholding technique. Different from existing thresholding methods, a novel thresholding technique referred to as the optimal $k$-thresholding was recently proposed by Zhao [SIAM J Optim, 30(1), pp. 31-55, 2020]. This technique simultaneously performs the minimization of an error metric for the problem and thresholding of the iterates generated by the classic gradient method. In this paper, we propose the so-called Newton-type optimal $k$-thresholding (NTOT) algorithm which is motivated by the appreciable performance of both Newton-type methods and the optimal $k$-thresholding technique for signal recovery. The guaranteed performance (including convergence) of the proposed algorithms are shown in terms of suitable choices of the algorithmic parameters and the restricted isometry property (RIP) of the sensing matrix which has been widely used in the analysis of compressive sensing algorithms. The simulation results based on synthetic signals indicate that the proposed algorithms are stable and efficient for signal recovery.",2021-04-06T08:57:07Z,2021-04-06T08:57:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02371v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02371v1,eess.SP

In this work, we study the application of RIS in a multi-user passive localization scenario, where we have one transmitter (Tx) and multiple asynchronous receivers (Rxs) with known locations. We aim to estimate the locations of multiple users equipped with RISs. The RISs only reflect the signal from the Tx to the Rxs and are not used as active transceivers themselves. Each Rx receives the signal from the Tx (LOS path) and the reflected signal from the RISs (NLOS path). We show that users' 3D position can be estimated with submeter accuracy in a large area around the transmitter, using the LOS and NLOS time-of-arrival measurements at the Rxs. We do so, by developing the signal model, deriving the Cramer-Rao bounds, and devising an estimator that attains these bounds. Furthermore, by orthogonalizing the RIS phase profiles across different users, we circumvent inter-path interference.",2021-04-25T09:35:12Z,2021-04-25T09:35:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12113v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12113v1,eess.SP
Higher-order tensor independent component analysis to realize MIMO   remote sensing of respiration and heartbeat signals,"Seishiro Goto, Ryo Natsuaki, Akira Hirose","This paper proposes a novel method of independent component analysis (ICA), which we name higher-order tensor ICA (HOT-ICA). HOT-ICA is a tensor ICA that makes effective use of the signal categories represented by the axes of a separating tensor. Conventional tensor ICAs, such as multilinear ICA (MICA) based on Tucker decomposition, do not fully utilize the high dimensionality of tensors because the matricization in MICA nullifies the tensor axial categorization. In this paper, we deal with multiple-target signal separation in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system to detect respiration and heartbeat. HOT-ICA realizes high robustness in learning by incorporating path information, i.e., the physical-measurement categories on which transmitting/receiving antennas were used. In numerical-physical experiments, our HOT-ICA system effectively separate the bio-signals successfully even in an obstacle-affecting environment, which is usually a difficult task. The results demonstrate the significance of the HOT-ICA, which keeps the tensor categorization unchanged for full utilization of the high-dimensionality of the separation tensor.",2021-05-03T10:10:04Z,2021-05-03T10:10:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00723v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00723v1,eess.SP
Multi-Spectrally Constrained Transceiver Design against Signal-Dependent   Interference,"Jing Yang, Augusto Aubry, Antonio De Maio, Xianxiang Yu, Guolong Cui","This paper focuses on the joint synthesis of constant envelope transmit signal and receive filter aimed at optimizing radar performance in signal-dependent interference and spectrally contested-congested environments. To ensure the desired Quality of Service (QoS) at each communication system, a precise control of the interference energy injected by the radar in each licensed/shared bandwidth is imposed. Besides, along with an upper bound to the maximum transmitted energy, constant envelope (with either arbitrary or discrete phases) and similarity constraints are forced to ensure compatibility with amplifiers operating in saturation regime and bestow relevant waveform features, respectively. To handle the resulting NP-hard design problems, new iterative procedures (with ensured convergence properties) are devised to account for continuous and discrete phase constraints, capitalizing on the Coordinate Descent (CD) framework. Two heuristic procedures are also proposed to perform valuable initializations.

High Resolution Time-Frequency Generation with Generative Adversarial   Networks,"Zeynel Deprem, A. Enis √áetin","Signal representation in Time-Frequency (TF) domain is valuable in many applications including radar imaging and inverse synthetic aparture radar. TF representation allows us to identify signal components or features in a mixed time and frequency plane. There are several well-known tools, such as Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and various other variants for such a purpose. The main requirement for a TF representation tool is to give a high-resolution view of the signal such that the signal components or features are identifiable. A commonly used method is the reassignment process which reduces the cross-terms by artificially moving smoothed WVD values from their actual location to the center of the gravity for that region. In this article, we propose a novel reassignment method using the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). We train a CGAN to perform the reassignment process. Through examples, it is shown that the method generates high-resolution TF representations which are better than the current reassignment methods.",2021-06-01T17:55:53Z,2021-06-01T17:55:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00668v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00668v1,eess.SP
Interference Mitigation for FMCW Radar With Sparse and Low-Rank Hankel   Matrix Decomposition,"Jianping Wang, Min Ding, Alexander Yarovoy","In this paper, the interference mitigation for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar system with a dechirping receiver is investigated. After dechirping operation, the scattered signals from targets result in beat signals, i.e., the sum of complex exponentials while the interferences lead to chirp-like short pulses. Taking advantage of these different time and frequency features between the useful signals and the interferences, the interference mitigation is formulated as an optimization problem: a sparse and low-rank decomposition of a Hankel matrix constructed by lifting the measurements. Then, an iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to tackle it by exploiting the Alternating Direction of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed approach does not need to detect the interference and also improves the estimation accuracy of the separated useful signals. Both numerical simulations with point-like targets and experiment results with distributed targets (i.e., raindrops) are presented to demonstrate and verify its performance. The results show that the proposed approach is generally applicable for interference mitigation in both stationary and moving target scenarios.",2021-06-12T11:24:42Z,2022-01-28T09:32:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06748v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06748v2,eess.SP
Random Paraunitary Projections,Ricardo L. de Queiroz,"Transforms using random matrices have been found to have many applications. We are concerned with the projection of a signal onto Gaussian-distributed random orthogonal bases. We also would like to easily invert the process through transposes in order to facilitate iterative reconstruction. We derive an efficient method to implement random unitary matrices of larger sizes through a set of Givens rotations. Random angles are hierarchically generated on-the-fly and the inverse merely requires traversing the angles in reverse order. Hierarchical randomization of angles also enables reduced storage. Using the random unitary matrices as building blocks we introduce random paraunitary systems (filter banks). We also highlight an efficient implementation of the paraunitary system and of its inverse. We also derive an adaptive under-decimated system, wherein one can control and adapt the amount of projections the signal undergoes, in effect, varying the sampling compression ratio as we go along the signal, without segmenting it. It may locally range from very compressive sampling matrices to (para) unitary random ones. One idea is to adapt to local sparseness characteristics of non-stationary signals.",2021-06-20T20:06:16Z,2021-06-20T20:06:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10746v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10746v1,eess.SP
Dirichlet process approach for radio-based simultaneous localization and   mapping,"Jaebok Lee, Hyowon Kim, Henk Wymeersch, Sunwoo Kim","Due to 5G millimeter wave (mmWave), spatial channel parameters are becoming highly resolvable, enabling accurate vehicle localization and mapping. We propose a novel method of radio simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with the Dirichlet process (DP). The DP, which can estimate the number of clusters as well as clustering, is capable of identifying the locations of reflectors by classifying signals when such 5G signals are reflected and received from various objects. We generate birth points using the measurements from 5G mmWave signals received by the vehicle and classify objects by clustering birth points generated over time. Each time we use the DP clustering method, we can map landmarks in the environment in challenging situations where false alarms exist in the measurements and change the cardinality of received signals. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. By comparing the results with the SLAM based on the Rao-Blackwellized probability hypothesis density filter, we confirm a slight drop in SLAM performance, but as a result, we validate that it has a significant gain in computational complexity.",2021-07-02T06:43:59Z,2021-07-02T06:43:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00864v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00864v1,eess.SP
Analysis of complex circadian time series data using wavelets,"Christoph Schmal, Gregor M√∂nke, Adri√°n E. Granada","Experiments that compare rhythmic properties across different genetic alterations and entrainment conditions underlie some of the most important breakthroughs in circadian biology. A robust estimation of the rhythmic properties of the circadian signals goes hand in hand with these discoveries. Widely applied traditional signal analysis methods such as fitting cosine functions or Fourier transformations rely on the assumption that oscillation periods do not change over time. However, novel high-resolution recording techniques have shown that, most commonly, circadian signals exhibit time-dependent changes of periods and amplitudes which cannot be captured with the traditional approaches. In this chapter we introduce a method to determine time-dependent properties of oscillatory signals, using the novel open-source Python-based Biological Oscillations Analysis Toolkit (pyBOAT). We show with examples how to detect rhythms, compute and interpret high-resolution time-dependent spectral results, analyze the main oscillatory component and to subsequently determine these main components time-dependent instantaneous period, amplitude and phase. We introduce step-by-step how such an analysis can be done by means of the easy-to-use point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI) provided by pyBOAT or executed within a Python programming environment.

WiSig: A Large-Scale WiFi Signal Dataset for Receiver and Channel   Agnostic RF Fingerprinting,"Samer Hanna, Samurdhi Karunaratne, Danijela Cabric","RF fingerprinting leverages circuit-level variability of transmitters to identify them using signals they send. Signals used for identification are impacted by a wireless channel and receiver circuitry, creating additional impairments that can confuse transmitter identification. Eliminating these impairments or just evaluating them, requires data captured over a prolonged period of time, using many spatially separated transmitters and receivers. In this paper, we present WiSig; a large scale WiFi dataset containing 10 million packets captured from 174 off-the-shelf WiFi transmitters and 41 USRP receivers over 4 captures spanning a month. WiSig is publicly available, not just as raw captures, but as conveniently pre-processed subsets of limited size, along with the scripts and examples. A preliminary evaluation performed using WiSig shows that changing receivers, or using signals captured on a different day can significantly degrade a trained classifier's performance. While capturing data over more days or more receivers limits the degradation, it is not always feasible and novel data-driven approaches are needed. WiSig provides the data to develop and evaluate these approaches towards channel and receiver agnostic transmitter fingerprinting.",2021-12-31T09:49:03Z,2022-01-12T05:58:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15363v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.15363v2,eess.SP

Prandoni","We present a method to maintain the subjective perception of volume of audio signals and, at the same time, reduce their absolute peak value. We focus on achieving this without compromising the perceived audio quality. This is specially useful, for example, to maximize the perceived reproduction level of loudspeakers where simply amplifying the signal amplitude, and hence their peak value, is limited due to already constrained physical designs. In particular, we minimize the absolute peak value subject to a constraint based on auditory masking. This limits the perceptual difference between the original and the modified signals. Moreover, this constraint can be tuned and allows to control the resulting audio quality. We show results comparing loudness and audio quality as a function of peak reduction. These results suggest that our method presents the best trade-off between loudness and audio quality when compared against classical methods based on compression and clipping.",2022-02-16T16:41:07Z,2022-02-16T16:41:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08183v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08183v1,"eess.SP, eess.AS"

We apply rotational-invariant coding to assist signal detection at the receiver without sending pilot symbols. We utilize Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to automatically cluster the received signals without supervision and optimize decision boundaries to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance.

FB-MSTCN: A Full-Band Single-Channel Speech Enhancement Method Based on   Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Network,"Zehua Zhang, Lu Zhang, Xuyi Zhuang, Yukun Qian, Heng Li, Mingjiang Wang","In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have significantly improved the performance of single-channel speech enhancement. However, due to the limitation of training data and computational complexity, real-time enhancement of full-band (48 kHz) speech signals is still very challenging. Because of the low energy of spectral information in the high-frequency part, it is more difficult to directly model and enhance the full-band spectrum using neural networks. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage real-time speech enhancement model with extraction-interpolation mechanism for a full-band signal. The 48 kHz full-band time-domain signal is divided into three sub-channels by extracting, and a two-stage processing scheme of `masking + compensation' is proposed to enhance the signal in the complex domain. After the two-stage enhancement, the enhanced full-band speech signal is restored by interval interpolation. In the subjective listening and word accuracy test, our proposed model achieves superior performance and outperforms the baseline model overall by 0.59 MOS and 4.0% WAcc for the non-personalized speech denoising task.",2022-03-15T06:55:55Z,2022-03-15T06:55:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07684v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07684v1,eess.AS

The causality in the network ensures non-leakage of representations from future time-intervals and the proposed loss function makes the network generate sequences with high correlation at the actual time delay. The proposed approach is also intrinsically interpretable as it does not lose time information.

Starting with a prior belief, the problem of searching for a frequency band that best matches a predicted location trajectory is investigated. To maximize the accuracy of the position estimate, a ranking-and-selection problem is mathematically formulated.

These continuous time-series signals are more effective when represented as an image for CNN-based classification. A continuous Wavelet transform filter is used here to get corresponding images. In achieving the best result generic CNN architectures lack sufficient accuracy and also have a higher run-time. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble method of transfer learning-based models to classify ECG signals. In our work, two modified VGG-16 models and one InceptionResNetV2 model with added feature extracting layers and ImageNet weights are working as the backbone. After ensemble, we report an increase of 6.36% accuracy than previous MLP-based algorithms.

Distributed Parallel Image Signal Extrapolation Framework using Message   Passing Interface,"J√ºrgen Seiler, Andr√© Kaup","This paper introduces a framework for distributed parallel image signal extrapolation. Since high-quality image signal processing often comes along with a high computational complexity, a parallel execution is desirable. The proposed framework allows for the application of existing image signal extrapolation algorithms without the need to modify them for a parallel processing. The unaltered application of existing algorithms is achieved by dividing input images into overlapping tiles which are distributed to compute nodes via Message Passing Interface. In order to keep the computational overhead low, a novel image tiling algorithm is proposed. Using this algorithm, a nearly optimum tiling is possible at a very small processing time. For showing the efficacy of the framework, it is used for parallelizing a high-complexity extrapolation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed framework has no negative impact on extrapolation quality while at the same time offering good scaling behavior on compute clusters.",2022-07-01T07:05:41Z,2022-07-01T07:05:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00238v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00238v1,eess.IV

Moreover, a modified EM (MEM) algorithm applicable to the noise assumption is also proposed. These proposed algorithms are improved to ensure the stability when the powers of sources are unequal. After being improved, numerical results illustrate that the EM algorithm has similar convergence with the MEM algorithm and the SAGE algorithm outperforms the EM and MEM algorithms for the deterministic signal model.

ORKA: Accelerated Kaczmarz Algorithms for Signal Recovery from One-Bit   Samples,"Arian Eamaz, Farhang Yeganegi, Deanna Needell, Mojtaba Soltanalian","One-bit quantization with time-varying sampling thresholds has recently found significant utilization potential in statistical signal processing applications due to its relatively low power consumption and low implementation cost. In addition to such advantages, an attractive feature of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is their superior sampling rates as compared to their conventional multi-bit counterparts. This characteristic endows one-bit signal processing frameworks with what we refer to as sample abundance. On the other hand, many signal recovery and optimization problems are formulated as (possibly non-convex) quadratic programs with linear feasibility constraints in the one-bit sampling regime. We demonstrate, with a particular focus on the nuclear norm minimization, that the sample abundance paradigm allows for the transformation of such quadratic problems to merely a linear feasibility problem by forming a large-scale overdetermined linear system; thus removing the need for costly optimization constraints and objectives. To make this achievable, we propose enhanced randomized Kaczmarz algorithms to tackle these highly overdetermined feasibility problems.

When considering oscillatory output dynamics, we report the emergence of synergy between successive measurements, meaning that the joint information in two measurements exceeds the sum of the individual information.

Dereverberation in Acoustic Sensor Networks Using Weighted Prediction   Error With Microphone-dependent Prediction Delays,"Anselm Lohmann, Toon van Waterschoot, Joerg Bitzer, Simon Doclo","In the last decades several multi-microphone speech dereverberation algorithms have been proposed, among which the weighted prediction error (WPE) algorithm. In the WPE algorithm, a prediction delay is required to reduce the correlation between the prediction signals and the direct component in the reference microphone signal. In compact arrays with closely-spaced microphones, the prediction delay is often chosen microphone-independent. In acoustic sensor networks with spatially distributed microphones, large time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) of the speech source between the reference microphone and other microphones typically occur. Hence, when using a microphone-independent prediction delay the reference and prediction signals may still be significantly correlated, leading to distortion in the dereverberated output signal. In order to decorrelate the signals, in this paper we propose to apply TDOA compensation with respect to the reference microphone, resulting in microphone-dependent prediction delays for the WPE algorithm. We consider both optimal TDOA compensation using crossband filtering in the short-time Fourier transform domain as well as band-to-band and integer delay approximations. Simulation results for different reverberation times using oracle as well as estimated TDOAs clearly show the benefit of using microphone-dependent prediction delays.",2023-01-18T16:52:07Z,2023-01-18T16:52:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07649v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07649v1,eess.AS

Next, we study the human behavior of resource consumption while taking individuals' behavioral disparity into account. Unlike rational decision makers who consume the amount of resource to maximize the expected utility function, human decision makers act to maximize their subjective utilities. We employ prospect theory to model humans' loss aversion towards a risky event. The amount of resource consumption that maximizes the humans' subjective utility is derived to characterize the actual behavior of humans.

Time-warped Trials,Eric Easthope,"I outline a signal resampling strategy for aligning event times between time series trials in contexts where significant event times like onsets and offsets vary between trials. These variations prevent direct comparisons of trials in practical contexts as comparisons require equal-length time series (Salari et al., 2019). Algorithms like dynamic time warping help us quantify these variations locally but do not apply well to continuous transformations of time series signals without interpolating or downsampling to add or remove samples (Jamid, 2004; Eckner, 2014). I show that with consideration for padding and sampling frequency that sinc interpolation is sufficient to resample parts of trial intervals to produce equal-length time-locked trials that correlate to and strongly approximate their unwarped counterparts with minimal interpolation effects. Specifically I show that interpolation effects can be minimized by oversampling, selectively interpolating mis-aligned parts of trials with respect to mean mis-aligned event lengths, and interpolating mis-aligned events with sufficient zero-padding. Interpolated signals then have a bandlimit well below the Nyquist frequency and satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem ensuring perfect reconstructions, and I find that I can track and potentially counteract resampling effects on signal energy quantities.",2023-02-01T16:57:16Z,2023-02-01T16:57:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00583v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00583v1,eess.SP
Orthogonal-Time-Frequency-Space Signal Design for Integrated Data and   Energy Transfer: Benefits from Doppler Offsets,"Jie Hu, Ke Xu, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang","Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is an advanced technology for enabling energy sustainability for massively deployed low-power electronic consumption components. However, the existing work of IDET using the orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms is designed for static scenarios, which would be severely affected by the destructive Doppler offset in high-mobility scenarios. Therefore, we proposed an IDET system based on orthogonal-time-frequency-space (OTFS) waveforms with the imperfect channel assumption, which is capable of counteracting the Doppler offset in high-mobility scenarios. At the transmitter, the OTFS-IDET system superimposes the random data signals and deterministic energy signals in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain with optimally designed amplitudes. The receiver optimally splits the received signal in the power domain for achieving the best IDET performance. After formulating a non-convex optimisation problem, it is transformed into a geometric programming (GP) problem through inequality relaxations to obtain the optimal solution.

A Step Closer Towards 5G mmWave-based Multipath Positioning in Dense   Urban Environments,"Qamar Bader, Sharief Saleh, Mohamed Elhabiby, Aboelmagd Noureldin","5G mmWave technology can turn multipath into a friend, as multipath components become highly resolvable in the time and angle domains. Multipath signals have not only been used in the literature to position the user equipment (UE) but also to create a map of the surrounding environment. Yet, many multipath-based methods in the literature share a common assumption, which entails that multipath signals are caused by single-bounce reflections only, which is not usually the case. There are very few methods in the literature that accurately filters out higher-order reflections, which renders the exploitation of multipath signals challenging. This paper proposes an ensemble learning-based model for classifying signal paths based on their order of reflection using 5G channel parameters. The model is trained on a large dataset of 3.6 million observations obtained from a quasi-real ray-tracing based 5G simulator that utilizes 3D maps of real-world downtown environments.

GSP = DSP + Boundary Conditions -- The Graph Signal Processing Companion   Model,"John Shi, Jose M. F.

The companion model shows that GSP can be made equivalent to DSP 'plus' appropriate boundary conditions (bc) - this is shown under broad conditions and holds for arbitrary undirected or directed graphs. This equivalence suggests how to broaden GSP - extend naturally a DSP concept to the GSP companion model and then transfer it back to the common graph vertex and graph Fourier domains.

Multichannel Frequency Estimation in Challenging Scenarios via   Structured Matrix Embedding and Recovery (StruMER),"Xunmeng Wu, Zai Yang, Zongben Xu","Multichannel frequency estimation with incomplete data and miscellaneous noises arises in array signal processing, modal analysis, wireless communications, and so on. In this paper, we consider maximum-likelihood(-like) optimization methods for frequency estimation in which proper objective functions are adopted subject to observed data patterns and noise types. We propose a universal signal-domain approach to solve the optimization problems by embedding the noiseless multichannel signal of interest into a series of low-rank positive-semidefinite block matrices of Hankel and Toeplitz submatrices and formulating the original parameter-domain optimization problems as equivalent structured matrix recovery problems. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is applied to solve the resulting matrix recovery problems in which both subproblems of ADMM are solved in (nearly) closed form. The proposed approach is termed as structured matrix embedding and recovery (StruMER).

Blind Deconvolution of Sparse Graph Signals in the Presence of   Perturbations,"Victor M. Tenorio, Samuel Rey, Antonio G. Marques","Blind deconvolution over graphs involves using (observed) output graph signals to obtain both the inputs (sources) as well as the filter that drives (models) the graph diffusion process. This is an ill-posed problem that requires additional assumptions, such as the sources being sparse, to be solvable. This paper addresses the blind deconvolution problem in the presence of imperfect graph information, where the observed graph is a perturbed version of the (unknown) true graph. While not having perfect knowledge of the graph is arguably more the norm than the exception, the body of literature on this topic is relatively small. This is partly due to the fact that translating the uncertainty about the graph topology to standard graph signal processing tools (e.g. eigenvectors or polynomials of the graph) is a challenging endeavor. To address this limitation, we propose an optimization-based estimator that solves the blind identification in the vertex domain, aims at estimating the inverse of the generating filter, and accounts explicitly for additive graph perturbations. Preliminary numerical experiments showcase the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithm.",2023-09-16T18:07:16Z,2023-09-16T18:07:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09063v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09063v1,eess.SP
Cramer-Rao Bound Optimization for Active RIS-Empowered ISAC Systems,"Qi Zhu, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu","Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which simultaneously performs sensing and communication functions within a shared frequency band and hardware platform, has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless systems. Nevertheless, the weak echo signal received by the low-sensitivity ISAC receiver significantly constrains sensing performance in scenarios involving obstructed targets. Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a prospective solution by situationally manipulating the wireless propagations and amplifying the signals. In this paper, we investigate active RIS-empowered ISAC systems to enhance radar echo signal quality as well as communication performance. In particular, we focus on the joint design of the base station (BS) transmit precoding and the active RIS reflection beamforming to optimize the parameter estimation performance in terms of Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) subject to the communication users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and majorization-minimization (MM) is proposed to solve the formulated challenging non-convex problem.

Most DJSCC work considers discrete-time analog transmission, while combining it with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) creates serious high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis on the use of various OFDM PAPR reduction techniques in the DJSCC system, including both conventional techniques such as clipping, companding, SLM and PTS, and deep learning-based PAPR reduction techniques such as PAPR loss and clipping with retraining. Our investigation shows that although conventional PAPR reduction techniques can be applied to DJSCC, their performance in DJSCC is different from the conventional split source channel coding. Moreover, we observe that for signal distortion PAPR reduction techniques, clipping with retraining achieves the best performance in terms of both PAPR reduction and recovery accuracy. It is also noticed that signal non-distortion PAPR reduction techniques can successfully reduce the PAPR in DJSCC without compromise to signal reconstruction.",2023-09-21T06:21:37Z,2023-09-21T06:21:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11803v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11803v1,eess.SP
Multiple Satellites Collaboration for Joint Code-aided CFOs and CPOs   Estimation,"Pingyue Yue, Yixuan Li, Yue Li, Rui Zhang, Shuai Wang, Jianping An","Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are being extensively researched in the development of secure Internet of Remote Things (IoRT). In scenarios with miniaturized terminals, the limited transmission power and long transmission distance often lead to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the satellite receiver, which degrades communication performance. A solution to address this issue is the utilization of cooperative satellites, which can combine signals received from multiple satellites, thereby significantly improve SNR. However, in order to maximize the combination gain, the signal coherent combining is necessary, which requires the carrier frequency and phase of each receiving signal to be aligned.   Under low SNR circumstances, carrier parameter estimation can be a significant challenge, especially for short burst transmission with no training sequence. In order to tackle it, we propose an iterative code-aided estimation algorithm for joint Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Carrier Phase Offset (CPO).

Given the non-convex nature of the objective, solving the above problem becomes challenging. Due to the differences in constraints between the transmit signal and the rescaling factor, we propose the double-space alternating optimization (DSAO) algorithm to optimize the two variables on orthogonal Stiefel manifold and Euclidean spaces, respectively.

Channel Autocorrelation Estimation for IRS-Aided Wireless Communications   Based on Power Measurements,"Ge Yan, Lipeng Zhu, Rui Zhang","Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can bring significant performance enhancement for wireless communication systems by reconfiguring wireless channels via passive signal reflection. However, such performance improvement generally relies on the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) for IRS-associated links. Prior IRS channel estimation strategies mainly estimate IRS-cascaded channels based on the excessive pilot signals received at the users/base station (BS) with time-varying IRS reflections, which, however, are not compatible with the existing channel training/estimation protocol for cellular networks. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new channel estimation scheme for IRS-assisted communication systems based on the received signal power measured at the user, which is practically attainable without the need of changing the current protocol. Specifically, due to the lack of signal phase information in power measurements, the autocorrelation matrix of the BS-IRS-user cascaded channel is estimated by solving equivalent matrix-rank-minimization problems.

In pursuit of this goal, a common strategy is that a unified waveform, such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), should serve dual-functional roles by enabling simultaneous sensing and communications (S&C) operations. However, the sensing performance of an OFDM communication signal is substantially affected by the randomness of the data symbols mapped from bit streams. Therefore, achieving a balance between preserving communication capability (i.e., the randomness) while improving sensing performance remains a challenging task. To cope with this issue, in this paper we analyze the ambiguity function of the OFDM communication signal modulated by random data. Subsequently, a probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) method is proposed to devise the probability distributions of constellation points, which is able to strike a scalable S&C tradeoff of the random transmitted signal.

Modulation For Modulo: A Sampling-Efficient High-Dynamic Range ADC,"Satish Mulleti, Resham Yashwanth Kumar, Laxmeesha Somappa","In high-dynamic range (HDR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), having many quantization bits minimizes quantization errors but results in high bit rates, limiting their application scope. A strategy combining modulo-folding with a low-DR ADC can create an efficient HDR-ADC with fewer bits. However, this typically demands oversampling, increasing the overall bit rate. An alternative method using phase modulation (PM) achieves HDR-ADC functionality by modulating the phase of a carrier signal with the analog input. This allows a low-DR ADC with fewer bits. We've derived identifiability results enabling reconstruction of the original signal from PM samples acquired at the Nyquist rate, adaptable to various signals and non-uniform sampling. Using discrete phase demodulation algorithms for practical implementation, our PM-based approach doesn't require oversampling in noise-free conditions, contrasting with modulo-based ADCs. With noise, our PM-based HDR method demonstrates efficiency with lower reconstruction errors and reduced sampling rates. Our hardware prototype illustrates reconstructing signals ten times greater than the ADC's DR from Nyquist rate samples, potentially replacing high-bit rate HDR-ADCs while meeting existing bit rate needs.",2023-11-22T10:04:37Z,2023-11-22T10:04:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13282v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13282v1,eess.SP
Lossless digraph signal processing via polar decomposition,Feng Ji,"In this paper, we present a signal processing framework for directed graphs. Unlike undirected graphs, a graph shift operator such as the adjacency matrix associated with a directed graph usually does not admit an orthogonal eigenbasis. This makes it challenging to define the Fourier transform. Our methodology leverages the polar decomposition to define two distinct eigendecompositions, each associated with different matrices derived from this decomposition. We propose to extend the frequency domain and introduce a Fourier transform that jointly encodes the spectral response of a signal for the two eigenbases from the polar decomposition. This allows us to define convolution following a standard routine. Our approach has two features: it is lossless as the shift operator can be fully recovered from factors of the polar decomposition. Moreover, it subsumes the traditional graph signal processing if the graph is directed. We present numerical results to show how the framework can be applied.",2023-12-30T03:46:42Z,2023-12-30T03:46:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00133v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00133v1,eess.SP

In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for user localization in a network with an HRIS. The protocol includes two steps. In the first step, the HRIS operates in full absorption mode and the user equipment (UE) transmits a signal that is locally processed at the HRIS to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA). In the second step, the base station transmits a downlink reference signal to the UE, and the HRIS superimposes a message by a backscatter modulation. The message contains information on the previously estimated AoA. Lastly, the UE, knowing the position of the HRIS, estimates the time of flight (ToF) from the signal of the second step and demodulates the information on the AoA to obtain an estimate of its location.

In this work, we show that the DASF algorithm can be extended to compute the filters associated with a certain class of non-smooth optimization problems. This extension makes the addition of sparsity-inducing norms to the problem's cost function possible, allowing sensor selection to be performed in a distributed fashion, alongside the filtering task of interest, thereby further reducing the network's energy consumption.

In this work we propose a novel signal classification criteria by exploiting the relationship between the generalized eigenvalue problem posed in the MPM and the numerical range of a pair of rectangular matrices. In particular, the classification test is formulated as a set inclusion problem, and no spectrum estimation is required. The technique is applied to a problem of electromagnetic scattering to classify dielectric materials using the scattering signal observed when a target is illuminated by an ultra-wideband signal.

Initially, VMD is applied to the original power signal, and the layer number for VMD decomposition is determined by selecting the K value associated with the smallest fractal box dimension among its components. Subsequently, several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) are obtained as fundamental, harmonic, and interharmonic signals representing different aspects of the power system. Furthermore, Hilbert transform(HT) is employed to extract instantaneous amplitude and frequency information from these harmonic signals. Experimental evaluation using simulation data and real-world power system data demonstrates that compared to Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), our proposed method achieves more accurate identification and effective extraction of harmonic signals.",2024-05-16T10:53:08Z,2024-05-16T10:53:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09979v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09979v1,eess.SP
Reference Channel Selection by Multi-Channel Masking for End-to-End   Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement,"Wang Dai, Xiaofei Li, Archontis Politis, Tuomas Virtanen","In end-to-end multi-channel speech enhancement, the traditional approach of designating one microphone signal as the reference for processing may not always yield optimal results. The limitation is particularly in scenarios with large distributed microphone arrays with varying speaker-to-microphone distances or compact, highly directional microphone arrays where speaker or microphone positions change over time. Current mask-based methods often fix the reference channel during training, which makes it not possible to adaptively select the reference channel for optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an adaptive approach for selecting the optimal reference channel. Our method leverages a multi-channel masking-based scheme, where multiple masked signals are combined to generate a single-channel output signal. This enhanced signal is then used for loss calculation, while the reference clean speech is adjusted based on the highest scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR). The experimental results on the Spear challenge simulated dataset D4 demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the conventional approach of using a fixed reference channel with single-channel masking.",2024-06-05T13:05:42Z,2024-06-11T07:19:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03228v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03228v2,eess.AS
Noise reduction in ISAR imaging of UAVs using weighted atomic norm   minimization and 2D-ADMM algorithm,"Mohammad Roueinfar, Mohammad Hossein Kahaei","The effect of noise on the Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) with sparse apertures is a challenging issue for image reconstruction with high resolution at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). It is well-known that the image resolution is affected by the bandwidth of the transmitted signal and the Coherent Processing Interval (CPI) in two dimensions, range and azimuth, respectively. To reduce the noise effect and thus increase the two-dimensional resolution of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) images, we propose the Fast Reweighted Atomic Norm Denoising (FRAND) algorithm by incorporating the weighted atomic norm minimization. To solve the problem, the Two-Dimensional Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (2D-ADMM) algorithm is developed to speed up the implementation procedure. Assuming sparse apertures for ISAR images of UAVs, we compare the proposed method with the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC), Cadzow, and SL0 methods in different SNRs. Simulation results show the superiority of FRAND at low SNRs based on the Mean-Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) criteria.",2024-06-16T10:38:22Z,2024-06-16T10:38:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10888v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10888v1,eess.SP
Robust Broadband Beamforming using Bilinear Programming,"Nakul Singh, Coleman DeLude, Mark A.

Our method offers state-of-the-art performance on narrowband signals and is naturally applied to broadband signals. Our beamformer operates by treating the forward model for the array samples as unknown. We show that the ""true"" forward model lies in the linear span of a small number of fixed linear systems. As a result, we can estimate the forward operator and the signal simultaneously by solving a bilinear inverse problem using least squares. Our numerical experiments show that if the angle of arrival is known to only be within an interval of reasonable size, there is very little loss in estimation performance compared to the case where the angle is known exactly.",2024-06-24T04:04:39Z,2024-06-24T04:04:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16304v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16304v1,eess.SP

The proposed zero-bit self-adaptation approach differs from classical forward and backward adaptation approaches in that the de-emphasis coefficient is estimated at the receiver, from the decoded pre-emphasized signal. This eliminates the need to transmit information that arises from forward adaptation as well as the signal-filter lag that is inherent in backward adaptation. Evaluation results show that the de-emphasis coefficient can be estimated accurately from the decoded pre-emphasized signal and that the proposed zero-bit self-adaptation approach provides comparable subjective improvement to forward adaptation.",2024-07-02T21:23:14Z,2024-07-02T21:23:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02672v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02672v1,"eess.AS, eess.SP"

Different from the existing literature, which has commonly focused on IRS beamforming optimization, in this paper, we pay special attention to designing effective signal processing approaches to extract sensing information from IRS-reshaped echo signals. To this end, we investigate an IRS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLOS) target detection and multi-parameter estimation problem in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To address this problem, we first propose a novel detection and direction estimation framework, including a low-overhead hierarchical codebook that allows the IRS to generate three-dimensional beams with adjustable beam direction and width, a delay spectrum peak-based beam training scheme for detection and direction estimation, and a beam refinement scheme for further enhancing the accuracy of the direction estimation. Then, we propose a target range and velocity estimation scheme by extracting the delay-Doppler information from the IRS-reshaped echo signals. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve 99.7% target detection rate, a 10^{-3}-rad level direction estimation accuracy, and a 10^{-6}-m/10^{-5}-m/s level range/velocity estimation accuracy.",2024-07-04T12:57:01Z,2024-07-04T12:57:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03902v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03902v1,eess.SP

Non-terrestrial SOOP analysis employs modified Cram\`er-Rao lower bound (MCRLB) to establish a relationship between SOOP characteristics and the accuracy of ranging information. This approach evaluates hybrid navigation module performance without direct signal simulation. The MCRLB is computed for ranging accuracy, considering factors like propagation delay, frequency offset, phase offset, and angle-of-arrival (AOA), across diverse non-terrestrial SOOP candidates. Additionally, Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and low earth orbit (LEO) SOOP availability are assessed.

In ZIMS-VFD, the transceiver inserts a zero-interval for each symbol in the transmit signal and provides self-interference (SI)-free intervals for itself. Meanwhile, it samples the receive signal in the provided SI-free intervals and restores the desired symbols. Based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), we formulate the system model and show the transmit signal structure.

Self-Similar Characteristics in Queue Length Dynamics: Insights from   Adaptive Signalized Corridor,"Shakib Mustavee, Shaurya Agarwal","Self-similarity, a fractal characteristic of traffic flow dynamics, is widely recognized in transportation engineering and physics. However, its practical application in real-world traffic scenarios remains limited. Conversely, the traffic flow dynamics at adaptive signalized intersections still need to be fully understood. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the queue length time series from an adaptive signalized corridor and characterizing its self-similarity. The findings uncover a $1/f$ structure in the power spectrum of queue lengths, indicative of self-similarity. Furthermore, the paper estimates local scaling exponents $(\alpha)$, a measure of self-similarity computed via detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and identifies a positive correlation with congestion patterns. Additionally, the study examines the fractal dynamics of queue length through the evolution of scaling exponent. As a result, the paper offers new insights into the queue length dynamics of signalized intersections, which might help better understand the impact of adaptivity within the system.",2024-08-01T18:44:50Z,2024-08-01T18:44:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00870v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00870v1,eess.SP
HELPS for Emergency Location Service: Hyper-Enhanced Local Positioning   System,"Hichan Moon, Hyosoon Park, Jiwon Seo","In this study, we propose a novel positioning and searching system for emergency location services, namely the hyper-enhanced local positioning system (HELPS), which is applicable to all mobile phone users, including legacy feature phone users. In the case of an emergency, rescuers are dispatched with portable signal measurement equipment around the estimated location of the emergency caller. Each signal measurement device measures the uplink signal from the mobile phone of the caller. After calculating the rough location of the caller's mobile phone based on these measurements, rescuers can efficiently search for the caller using the received uplink signal strength. Thus, the positioning accuracy in a conventional sense is not a limitation for rescuers in finding the caller. HELPS is not a traditional positioning system but rather a system with humans in the loop designed to reduce search time in emergencies. HELPS can provide emergency location information even in environments where the GPS or Wi-Fi is not functional. Furthermore, for HELPS operation, no hardware changes or software installations are required on the caller's mobile phone.",2024-08-07T07:56:33Z,2024-08-07T07:56:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03609v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03609v1,eess.SP

Due to the limitation of fixed kernel functions, however, from the view point of filtering they fail to automatically adjust the response according to the change of signal to adapt to different signal characteristics. In this letter, we integrate Wiener filter principle and the time-frequency filtering mechanism of CCTFD to design the least-squares adaptive filter method in the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) domain, giving birth to the least-squares adaptive filter-based CCTFD whose kernel function can be adjusted with the input signal automatically to achieve the minimum mean-square error denoising in the WVD domain.

To this end, we consider three architectures of RIS: locally passive diagonal (LP-D), globally passive diagonal (GP-D), and globally passive beyond diagonal (GP-BD). In a globally passive RIS, the power of the output signal of the RIS is not greater than its input power, but some RIS elements can amplify the signal. In a locally passive RIS, every element cannot amplify the incident signal. We show that these RIS architectures can substantially improve energy efficiency (EE) if the static power of the RIS elements is not too high. Moreover, GP-BD RIS, which has a higher complexity and static power than LP-D RIS and GP-D RIS, provides better spectral efficiency, but its EE performance highly depends on the static power consumption and may be worse than its diagonal counterparts.",2024-08-08T07:13:45Z,2024-08-08T07:13:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04271v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04271v1,eess.SP
Interference-Free Backscatter Communications for OFDM-Based Symbiotic   Radio,"Muhammad Bilal Janjua, Alphan ≈ûahin, H√ºseyin Arslan","This study proposes an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based scheme to achieve interference-free backscatter communications (BC) in a symbiotic radio system. In specific, we propose three frequency shift keying (FSK) based backscatter modulation schemes to shift the primary signal, i.e., the OFDM symbols transmitted from a base station (BS), in the frequency domain to transmit its information. Symbiotically, the BS empties specific subcarriers within the band so that the received frequency-shifted signals from the backscatter device and the primary signal are always orthogonal. The first scheme relies on the combination of on-off keying (OOK) within the FSK modulation while the second and the third schemes are based on the conventional FSK modulation with different in-band null-subcarrier allocation. These schemes allow the use of non-coherent detection at the receiver which addresses the channel estimation challenge for the signals arriving from a backscatter device. We derive the bit-error rate performance of the detector theoretically. The comprehensive simulations show that the proposed approach achieves a lower bit-error rate up to 10-4 at 30 dB with BC by eliminating direct link interference.",2024-08-17T13:10:25Z,2025-02-12T15:27:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09192v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09192v2,eess.SP
Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery,"Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos","We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.",2024-09-18T17:32:31Z,2024-09-18T17:32:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12164v1,eess.SP

The precoder design aims at maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the sensing receivers given communication constraints.

Given sEMG datasets, such as electromyography analysis of human activity databases (DB1 and DB4), with multi-channel signals corresponding to ADL, is it possible to determine the ADL categories without explicit feature extraction from sEMG signals. Further is it possible to learn across the datasets to improve the classification performances. A classification framework, named EMGTTL, is developed that uses transformers for classification of ADL and the performance is enhanced by cross-data transfer learning. The methodology is implemented on EMAHA-DB1 and EMAHA-DB4. Experiments have shown that the transformer architecture achieved 64.47% accuracy for DB1 and 68.82% for DB4.

Optimal Beamforming Design for ISAC with Sensor-Aided Active RIS,"Ahmed Magbool, Vaibhav Kumar, Mark F.

To address this issue, this paper employs a sensor-aided active RIS to enhance ISAC system performance. The goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the echo signal from the target at the sensor-array while meeting constraints on communication signal quality, power budgets, and RIS amplification limits. The optimization problem is challenging due to its non-convex nature and the coupling between the optimization variables.

Frames and vertex-frequency representations in graph fractional Fourier   domain,"Linbo Shang, Zhichao Zhang","Vertex-frequency analysis, particularly the windowed graph Fourier transform (WGFT), is a significant challenge in graph signal processing. Tight frame theories is known for its low computational complexity in signal reconstruction, while fractional order methods shine at unveil more detailed structural characteristics of graph signals. In the graph fractional Fourier domain, we introduce multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier frames (MWGFRFF) to facilitate the construction of tight frames. This leads to developing the multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier transform (MWGFRFT), enabling novel vertex-frequency analysis methods. A reconstruction formula is derived, along with results concerning dual and tight frames. To enhance computational efficiency, a fast MWGFRFT (FMWGFRFT) algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, we define shift multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier frames (SMWGFRFF) and their associated transform (SMWGFRFT), exploring their dual and tight frames. Experimental results indicate that FMWGFRFT and SMWGFRFT excel in extracting vertex-frequency features in the graph fractional Fourier domain, with their combined use optimizing analytical performance. Applications in signal anomaly detection demonstrate the advantages of FMWGFRFT.",2024-12-28T15:47:04Z,2024-12-28T15:47:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20184v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20184v1,eess.SP
RadDet: A Wideband Dataset for Real-Time Radar Spectrum Detection,"Zi Huang, Simon Denman, Akila Pemasiri, Terrence Martin, Clinton Fookes","Real-time detection of radar signals in a wideband radio frequency spectrum is a critical situational assessment function in electronic warfare. Compute-efficient detection models have shown great promise in recent years, providing an opportunity to tackle the spectrum detection problem. However, progress in radar spectrum detection is limited by the scarcity of publicly available wideband radar signal datasets accompanied by corresponding annotations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and challenging dataset for radar detection (RadDet), comprising a large corpus of radar signals occupying a wideband spectrum across diverse radar density environments and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). RadDet contains 40,000 frames, each generated from 1 million in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) samples across a 500 MHz frequency band. RadDet includes 11 classes of radar samples across 6 different SNR settings, 2 radar density environments, and 3 different time-frequency resolutions, with corresponding time-frequency and class annotations. We evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art real-time detection models on RadDet and a modified radar classification dataset from NIST (NIST-CBRS) to establish a novel benchmark for wideband radar spectrum detection.",2025-01-06T07:30:15Z,2025-01-06T07:30:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10407v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10407v1,eess.SP
Learning to reconstruct signals with inexact sensing operator via   knowledge distillation,"Roman Jacome, Leon Suarez, Romario Gualdr√≥n-Hurtado, Luis Gonzalez, Henry Arguello","In computational optical imaging and wireless communications, signals are acquired through linear coded and noisy projections, which are recovered through computational algorithms. Deep model-based approaches, i.e., neural networks incorporating the sensing operators, are the state-of-the-art for signal recovery. However, these methods require exact knowledge of the sensing operator, which is often unavailable in practice, leading to performance degradation. Consequently, we propose a new recovery paradigm based on knowledge distillation. A teacher model, trained with full or almost exact knowledge of a synthetic sensing operator, guides a student model with an inexact real sensing operator. The teacher is interpreted as a relaxation of the student since it solves a problem with fewer constraints, which can guide the student to achieve higher performance. We demonstrate the improvement of signal reconstruction in computational optical imaging for single-pixel imaging with miscalibrated coded apertures systems and multiple-input multiple-output symbols detection with inexact channel matrix.",2025-01-18T15:10:18Z,2025-01-18T15:10:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10794v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10794v1,eess.SP
A Hodge-FAST Framework for High-Resolution Dynamic Functional   Connectivity Analysis of Higher Order Interactions in EEG Signals,"Om Roy, Yashar Moshfeghi, Jason Smith, Agustin Ibanez, Mario A. Parra, Keith M.

This method leverages graph-based topology and simplicial analysis to explore transient connectivity patterns at multiple scales, addressing noise, sparsity, and computational efficiency. The temporal EEG data are first sparsified by keeping only the most globally important connections, instantaneous connectivity at these connections is then filtered by global long-term stable correlations. This tensor is then decomposed into three orthogonal components to study signal flows over higher-order structures such as triangle and loop structures. Our analysis of Alzheimer-related MCI patients show significant temporal differences related to higher-order interactions that a pairwise analysis on its own does not implicate. This allows us for the first time to capture higher-dimensional interactions at high temporal resolution in noisy EEG signal recordings.",2025-02-01T01:13:45Z,2025-02-07T11:41:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00249v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00249v2,eess.SP
Maximizing Spectrum Efficiency of Data-Carrying Reference Signals via   Bayesian Optimization,"Taiki Kato, Hiroki Iimori, Chandan Pradhan, Szabolcs Malomsoky, Naoki Ishikawa","Data-carrying reference signals are a type of reference signal (RS) constructed on the Grassmann manifold, which allows for simultaneous data transmission and channel estimation to achieve boosted spectral efficiency at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, they do not improve spectral efficiency at low to middle SNRs compared with conventional RSs. To address this problem, we propose a numerical optimization-based Grassmann constellation design on the Grassmann manifold that accounts for both data transmission and channel estimation. In our numerical optimization, we derive an upper bound on the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of estimated channel matrices and a lower bound on the noncoherent average mutual information (AMI), and these bounds are optimized simultaneously by using a Bayesian optimization technique. The proposed objective function outperforms conventional design metrics in obtaining Pareto-optimal constellations for NMSE and AMI. The constellation obtained by our method achieves an NMSE comparable to conventional non-data-carrying RSs while enabling data transmission, resulting in superior AMI performance and improved spectral efficiency even at middle SNRs.",2025-02-20T11:10:22Z,2025-02-20T11:10:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14453v1,eess.SP

A neural network framework is established to optimize the configurations of the RIS, aiming to lower the power from unwanted sources while enhancing the target signal. The network produces settings that focus on maximizing the signal at the intended angle. Utilizing a convolution-based approach, we illustrate the effective tuning of RIS elements for interference mitigation and the creation of nulls in the direction of interference, resulting in a better signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR).

Enhanced motor imagery-based EEG classification using a discriminative   graph Fourier subspace,"Maliheh Miri, Vahid Abootalebi, Hamid Behjat","Dealing with irregular domains, graph signal processing (GSP) has attracted much attention especially in brain imaging analysis.

These microelectrodes have also been instrumental in the localization of neuronal signal sources. However, existing neuron localization methods have been mostly utilized in vivo, where the true neuron location remains unknown. Therefore, these methods could not be experimentally validated. This article presents experimental validation of a method capable of estimating both the location and intensity of an electrical signal source. A four-sensor microelectrode (tetrode) immersed in a saline solution was used to record stimulus patterns at multiple intensity levels generated by a stimulating electrode. The location of the tetrode was varied with respect to the stimulator. The location and intensity of the stimulator were estimated using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, and the results were quantified by comparison to the true values. The localization results, with an accuracy and precision of ~ 10 microns, and ~ 11 microns respectively, imply that MUSIC can resolve individual neuronal sources. Similarly, source intensity estimations indicate that this approach can track changes in signal amplitude over time.

A State Space Technique for Wildlife Position Estimation Using   Non-Simultaneous Signal Strength Measurements,"Ramakrishna Janaswamy, Pamela Loring, James McLaren","A novel state-space technique is presented to estimate the location and airborne movements of VHF tagged wildlife individuals with fixed VHF arrays. The approach combines a movement model (Ornstein- Uhlenbeck random process in the transverse (horizontal) plane and a Cox- Ingersoll-Ross process in the vertical direction) to ensure biologically-consistent trajectories in three-dimensions, and an observation model to account for the effect of range, altitude and bearing angle on the received signal strength. The observation model of received signals accounts for low-end saturation from receiver noise, high-end saturation from receiver non-linearities as well as a wireless multipath phenomena, which modulates the received signal according to range, the altitude and radiation characteristics of the Yagi array. A pattern function for the Yagi array is synthesized that facilitates linearization of the received signals and subsequent application of Kalman filtering.   We first validate the model using a simulated trajectory and then estimate the space-time trajectory of a migrating VHF-tagged shorebird, which was tracked with a regional automated radio telemetry network. The algorithm accurately predicted the average movement trajectory given the system parameters and the initial conditions (average error $<$ 1 km). The modeled shorebird track represents a first estimate in three-dimensional (3D) of a radio tagged bird using a fixed telemetry array, and was qualitatively reasonable, but exhibited some sensitivity in the vertical plane and to initial conditions.",2018-05-28T20:56:02Z,2018-05-28T20:56:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11171v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11171v1,eess.SP
Discrete Linear Canonical Transform Based on Hyperdifferential Operators,"Aykut Ko√ß, Burak Bartan, Haldun M. Ozaktas","Linear canonical transforms (LCTs) are of importance in many areas of science and engineering with many applications. Therefore a satisfactory discrete implementation is of considerable interest. Although there are methods that link the samples of the input signal to the samples of the linear canonical transformed output signal, no widely-accepted definition of the discrete LCT has been established. We introduce a new approach to defining the discrete linear canonical transform (DLCT) by employing operator theory. Operators are abstract entities that can have both continuous and discrete concrete manifestations. Generating the continuous and discrete manifestations of LCTs from the same abstract operator framework allows us to define the continuous and discrete transforms in a structurally analogous manner. By utilizing hyperdifferential operators, we obtain a DLCT matrix which is totally compatible with the theory of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its dual and circulant structure, which makes further analytical manipulations and progress possible. The proposed DLCT is to the continuous LCT, what the DFT is to the continuous Fourier transform (FT). The DLCT of the signal is obtained simply by multiplying the vector holding the samples of the input signal by the DLCT matrix.",2018-05-28T13:10:41Z,2019-02-13T13:38:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11416v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11416v2,eess.SP
Change Detection with Sparse Signals using Quantum Designs,"Aditi Jain, Pradeep Sarvepalli, Srikrishna Bhashyam, Arun Pachai Kannu","We consider the change detection problem where the pre-change observation vectors are purely noise and the post-change observation vectors are noise-corrupted compressive measurements of sparse signals with a common support, measured using a sensing matrix. In general, post-change distribution of the observations depends on parameters such as the support and variances of the sparse signal. When these parameters are unknown, we propose two approaches. In the first approach, we approximate the post-change pdf based on the known parameters such as mutual coherence of the sensing matrix and bounds on the signal variances. In the second approach, we parameterize the post-change pdf with an unknown parameter and try to adaptively estimate this parameter using a stochastic gradient descent method. In both these approaches, we employ CUSUM algorithm with various decision statistics such as the energy of the observations, correlation values with columns of the sensing matrix and the maximum value of such correlations. We study the performance of these approaches and offer insights on the relevance of different decision statistics in different SNR regimes. We also address the problem of designing sensing matrices with small coherence by using designs from quantum information theory. One such design, called SIC POVM, also has an additional structure which allows exact computation of the post-change pdfs of some decision statistics even when the support set of the sparse signal is unknown. We apply our detection algorithms with SIC POVM based sequences to a massive random access problem and show their superior performance over conventional Gold codes.",2019-01-24T11:16:34Z,2019-01-24T11:16:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08352v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08352v1,eess.SP
On Bandwidth Constrained Distributed Detection of a Deterministic Signal   in Correlated Noise,"Nahal Maleki, Azadeh Vosoughi","We consider a Neyman-Pearson (NP) distributed binary detection problem in a bandwidth constrained wireless sensor network, where the fusion center (FC) is responsible for fusing signals received from sensors and making a final decision about the presence or absence of a signal source in correlated Gaussian noises. Given this signal model, our goals are (i) to investigate whether or not randomized transmission can improve detection performance, under communication rate constraint, and (ii) to explore how the correlation among observation noises would impact performance. To achieve these goals, we propose two novel schemes that combine the concepts of censoring and randomized transmission (which we name CRT-I and CRT-II schemes) and compare them with the pure censoring scheme. In CRT (pure censoring) schemes, we map randomly (deterministically) a sensor's observation to a ternary transmit symbol $u_k \in \{-1,0,1\}$ where ``$0$'' corresponds to no transmission (sensor censors). Assuming sensors transmit $u_k$'s over orthogonal fading channels, we formulate and address two system-level constrained optimization problems: in the first problem we minimize the probability of miss detection at the FC, subject to constraints on the probabilities of transmission and false alarm at the FC; in the second (dual) problem we minimize the probability of transmission, subject to constraints on the probabilities of miss detection and false alarm at the FC. Based on the expressions of the objective functions and the constraints in each problem, we propose different optimization techniques to address these two problems. Through analysis and simulations, we explore and provide the conditions (in terms of communication channel signal-to-noise ratio, degree of correlation among sensor observation noises, and maximum allowed false alarm probability) under which CRT schemes outperform pure censoring scheme.",2019-06-14T21:21:43Z,2019-06-14T21:21:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06408v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06408v1,eess.SP
Distributed Detection of Sparse Stochastic Signals via Fusion of 1-bit   Local Likelihood Ratios,"Chengxi Li, You He, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, Pramod K. Varshney","In this letter, we consider the detection of sparse stochastic signals with sensor networks (SNs), where the fusion center (FC) collects 1-bit data from the local sensors and then performs global detection. For this problem, a newly developed 1-bit locally most powerful test (LMPT) detector requires 3.3Q sensors to asymptotically achieve the same detection performance as the centralized LMPT (cLMPT) detector with Q sensors. This 1-bit LMPT detector is based on 1-bit quantized observations without any additional processing at the local sensors. However, direct quantization of observations is not the most efficient processing strategy at the sensors since it incurs unnecessary information loss. In this letter, we propose an improved-1-bit LMPT (Im-1-bit LMPT) detector that fuses local 1-bit quantized likelihood ratios (LRs) instead of directly quantized local observations. In addition, we design the quantization thresholds at the local sensors to ensure asymptotically optimal detection performance of the proposed detector. It is shown theoretically and numerically that, with the designed quantization thresholds, the proposed Im-1-bit LMPT detector for the detection of sparse signals requires less number of sensor nodes to compensate for the performance loss caused by 1-bit quantization.",2019-08-26T13:01:45Z,2019-11-05T01:31:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09656v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.09656v2,eess.SP
Learning the Treatment Effects on FTIR Signals Subject to Multiple   Sources of Uncertainties,"Hongzhen Tian, Andi Wang, Jialei Chen, Xuzhou Jiang, Jianjun Shi, Chuck Zhang, Yajun Mei, Ben Wang","Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a versatile technique for characterizing the chemical composition of the various uncertainties, including baseline shift and multiplicative error. This study aims at analyzing the effect of certain treatment on the FTIR responses subject to these uncertainties. A two-step method is proposed to quantify the treatment effect on the FTIR signals. First, an optimization problem is solved to calculate the template signal by aligning the pre-treatment FTIR signals. Second, the effect of treatment is decomposed as the pattern of modification $\mathbf{g}$ that describes the overall treatment effect on the spectra and a vector of effect $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ that describes the degree of modification. $\mathbf g$ and $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ are solved by another optimization problem. They have explicit engineering interpretations and provide useful information on how the treatment effect change the surface chemical components. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first validated in a simulation. In a real case study, it's used to investigate how the plasma exposure applied at various heights affects the FTIR signal which indicates the change of the chemical composition on the composite material. The vector of effects indicates the range of effective plasma height, and the pattern of modification matches existing engineering knowledge well.",2019-08-29T00:59:02Z,2019-08-29T00:59:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11001v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11001v1,eess.SP
Principle-driven Fiber Transmission Model based on PINN Neural Network,"Yubin Zang, Zhenming Yu, Kun Xu, Xingzeng Lan, Minghua Chen, Sigang Yang, Hongwei Chen","In this paper, a novel principle-driven fiber transmission model based on physical induced neural network (PINN) is proposed. Unlike data-driven models which regard fiber transmission problem as data regression tasks, this model views it as an equation solving problem. Instead of adopting input signals and output signals which are calculated by SSFM algorithm in advance before training, this principle-driven PINN based fiber model adopts frames of time and distance as its inputs and the corresponding real and imaginary parts of NLSE solutions as its outputs. By taking into account of pulses and signals before transmission as initial conditions and fiber physical principles as NLSE in the design of loss functions, this model will progressively learn the transmission rules. Therefore, it can be effectively trained without the data labels, referred as the pre-calculated signals after transmission in data-driven models. Due to this advantage, SSFM algorithm is no longer needed before the training of principle-driven fiber model which can save considerable time consumption. Through numerical demonstration, the results show that this principle-driven PINN based fiber model can handle the prediction tasks of pulse evolution, signal transmission and fiber birefringence for different transmission parameters of fiber telecommunications.",2021-08-24T13:46:32Z,2021-08-24T13:46:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10734v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10734v1,eess.SP
Prior-Guided Deep Interference Mitigation for FMCW Radars,"Jianping Wang, Runlong Li, Yuan He, Yang Yang","A prior-guided deep learning (DL) based interference mitigation approach is proposed for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. In this paper, the interference mitigation problem is tackled as a regression problem. Considering the complex-valued nature of radar signals, the complex-valued convolutional neural network is utilized as an architecture for implementation, which is different from the conventional real-valued counterparts. Meanwhile, as the useful beat signals of FMCW radars and interferences exhibit different distributions in the time-frequency domain, this prior feature is exploited as a regularization term to avoid overfitting of the learned representation. The effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed complex-valued fully convolutional network (CV-FCN) based interference mitigation approach are verified and analyzed through both simulated and measured radar signals. Compared to the real-valued counterparts, the CV-FCN shows a better interference mitigation performance with a potential of half memory reduction in low Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) scenarios. Moreover, the CV-FCN trained using only simulated data can be directly utilized for interference mitigation in various measured radar signals and shows a superior generalization capability. Furthermore, by incorporating the prior feature, the CV-FCN trained on only 1/8 of the full data achieves comparable performance as that on the full dataset in low SINR scenarios, and the training procedure converges faster.",2021-08-30T07:26:20Z,2021-08-30T07:26:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13023v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13023v1,eess.SP
Bandlimited signal reconstruction from leaky integrate-and-fire encoding   using POCS,"Nguyen T. Thao, Dominik Rzepka, Marek Mi≈õkowicz","Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) encoding is a model of neuron transfer function in biology that has recently attracted the attention of the signal processing and neuromorphic computing communities as a technique of event-based sampling for data acquisition. While LIF enables the implementation of analog-circuit signal samplers of lower complexity and higher accuracy simultaneously, the core difficulty of this technique is the retrieval of an input from its LIF-encoded output. In this article, we study this problem in the context of bandlimited inputs, by extracting the most abstract features of an LIF encoder as a generalized nonuniform sampler. In this view, the LIF output is seen as the transformation of the input by a known linear operator. We show that the signal reconstruction method of projection onto convex sets (POCS) converges to a weighted pseudo-inverse of this operator. This allows perfect recovery under uniqueness of reconstruction, minimum-norm reconstruction under incomplete sampling, as well as a noise shaping of time quantization that outperforms standard pseudo-inversion. On the practical side, a single iteration of the POCS method can be used to improve any estimate whose LIF samples are not consistent with those of the input, and a rigorous discrete-time implementation of this iteration is proposed that does not require a Nyquist-rate representation of the signals.",2022-01-09T13:18:53Z,2022-07-27T14:53:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03006v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03006v2,eess.SP
Target Sensing with Intelligent Reflecting Surface: Architecture and   Performance,"Xiaodan Shao, Changsheng You, Wenyan Ma, Xiaoming Chen, Rui Zhang","Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology to reconfigure the radio propagation environment by dynamically controlling wireless signal's amplitude and/or phase via a large number of reflecting elements. In contrast to the vast literature on studying IRS's performance gains in wireless communications, we study in this paper a new application of IRS for sensing/localizing targets in wireless networks. Specifically, we propose a new self-sensing IRS architecture where the IRS controller is capable of transmitting probing signals that are not only directly reflected by the target (referred to as the direct echo link), but also consecutively reflected by the IRS and then the target (referred to as the IRS-reflected echo link). Moreover, dedicated sensors are installed at the IRS for receiving both the direct and IRS-reflected echo signals from the target, such that the IRS can sense the direction of its nearby target by applying a customized multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. However, since the angle estimation mean square error (MSE) by the MUSIC algorithm is intractable, we propose to optimize the IRS passive reflection for maximizing the average echo signals' total power at the IRS sensors and derive the resultant Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the angle estimation MSE. Last, numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed new IRS sensing architecture and algorithm, as compared to other benchmark sensing systems/algorithms.",2022-01-22T16:14:32Z,2022-05-25T00:08:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09091v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09091v2,eess.SP
Waveform Optimization with SINR Criteria for FDA Radar in the Presence   of Signal-Dependent Mainlobe Interference,"Wenkai Jia, Andreas Jakobsson, Wen-Qin Wang","In this paper, we focus on the design of the transmit waveforms of a frequency diverse array (FDA) in order to improve the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the presence of signal-dependent mainlobe interference. Since the classical multi-carrier matched filtering-based FDA receiver cannot effectively utilize the waveform diversity of FDA, a novel FDA receiver framework based on multi-channel mixing and low-pass filtering is developed to keep the separation of the transmit waveform at the receiver side, while preserving the FDA range-controllable degrees of freedom. Furthermore, a range-angle minimum variance distortionless response beamforming technique is introduced to synthesize receiver filter weights with the ability to suppress a possible signal-dependent mainlobe interference. The resulting FDA transmit waveform design problem is initially formulated as an optimization problem consisting of a non-convex objective function and multiple non-convex constraints. To efficiently slove this, we introduce two algorithms, one based on a signal relaxation technique, and the other based on the majorization minimization technique. The preferable performance of the proposed multi-channel low-pass filtering receiver and the optimized transmit waveforms is illustrated using numerical simulations, indicating that the resulting FDA system is not only able to effectively suppress mainlobe interference, but also to yield estimates with a higher SINR than the FDA system without waveform optimization.",2022-04-14T22:05:36Z,2022-12-20T14:43:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07248v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07248v2,eess.SP
Resampling Images to a Regular Grid from a Non-Regular Subset of Pixel   Positions Using Frequency Selective Reconstruction,"J√ºrgen Seiler, Markus Jonscher, Michael Sch√∂berl, Andr√© Kaup","Even though image signals are typically defined on a regular two-dimensional grid, there also exist many scenarios where this is not the case and the amplitude of the image signal only is available for a non-regular subset of pixel positions. In such a case, a resampling of the image to a regular grid has to be carried out. This is necessary since almost all algorithms and technologies for processing, transmitting or displaying image signals rely on the samples being available on a regular grid. Thus, it is of great importance to reconstruct the image on this regular grid so that the reconstruction comes closest to the case that the signal has been originally acquired on the regular grid. In this paper, Frequency Selective Reconstruction is introduced for solving this challenging task. This algorithm reconstructs image signals by exploiting the property that small areas of images can be represented sparsely in the Fourier domain. By further taking into account the basic properties of the Optical Transfer Function of imaging systems, a sparse model of the signal is iteratively generated. In doing so, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve a very high reconstruction quality, in terms of PSNR and SSIM as well as in terms of visual quality. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms and gains of more than 1 dB PSNR are possible.",2022-04-27T12:11:52Z,2022-04-27T12:11:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12873v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12873v1,eess.IV
Variation of a Signal in Schwarzschild Spacetime,"Huan Liu, Xiang-Gen Xia, Ran Tao","In this paper, the variation of a signal in Schwarzschild spacetime is studied and a general equation for frequency shift parameter (FSP) is presented. It shows that FSP depends on the gravitationally-modified Doppler effects and the gravitational effects of observers. In addition, rates of time of a transmitter and a receiver may be different. When FSP is a function of the time of a receiver, FSP contributed by gravitational effect (GFSP) or gravitationally-modified Doppler effect (GMDFSP) may lead a bandlimited signal to a non-bandlimited signal. Based on the equation, FSP as a function of the time of a receiver is calculated for three scenarios: a) a spaceship moves away from a star with a constant velocity communicating with a transmitter at a fixed position; b) a spaceship moves around a star with different conic trajectories communicating with a transmitter at a fixed position; c) a signal is transmitted at a fixed position in a star system to a receiver moving with an elliptical trajectory in another star system.

Deep Learning Network Based Spectrum Sensing Methods for OFDM Systems,"Qingqing Cheng, Zhenguo Shi, Diep N. Nguyen, Eryk Dutkiewicz","Spectrum sensing plays a critical role in dynamic spectrum sharing, a promising technology to address the radio spectrum shortage. In particular, sensing of Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, a widely accepted multi-carrier transmission paradigm, has received paramount interest. Despite various efforts, most conventional OFDM sensing methods suffer from noise uncertainty, timing delay and carrier frequency offset (CFO) that significantly degrade the sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, this work develops two novel OFDM sensing frameworks drawing support from deep learning networks. Specifically, we first propose a stacked autoencoder based spectrum sensing method (SAE-SS), in which a stacked autoencoder network is designed to extract the inherent features of OFDM signals. Using these features to classify the OFDM user's activities, SAE-SS is much more robust to noise uncertainty, timing delay, and CFO than the conventional OFDM sensing methods. Moreover, SAE-SS doesn't require any prior information of signals (e.g., signal structure, pilot tones, cyclic prefix) which are essential for the conventional feature-based OFDM sensing methods. To further improve the sensing accuracy of SAE-SS, especially under low SNR conditions, we propose a stacked autoencoder based spectrum sensing method using time-frequency domain signals (SAE-TF). SAE-TF achieves higher sensing accuracy than SAW-SS at the cost of higher computational complexity. Extensive simulation results show that both SAE-SS and SAE-TF can achieve significantly higher sensing accuracy, compared with state of the art approaches that suffer from noise uncertainty, timing delay and CFO.",2018-07-25T01:59:59Z,2019-01-01T13:59:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09414v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09414v4,eess.SP

Connected Vehicle Supported Adaptive Traffic Control for Near-congested   Condition in a Mixed Traffic Stream,"Sakib Mahmud Khan, Mashrur Chowdhury","Connected Vehicles (CVs) have the potential to significantly increase the safety, mobility, and environmental benefits of transportation applications. In this research, we have developed a real time adaptive traffic signal control algorithm that utilizes only CV data to compute the signal timing parameters for an urban arterial in the near congested condition. We have used a machine learning based short term traffic forecasting model to predict the overall traffic counts in CV based platoons. Using a multi objective optimization technique, we compute the green interval time for each intersection using CV based platoons. Later, we dynamically adjust intersection offsets in real time, so the vehicles in the major street can experience improved operational conditions compared to loop detector based actuated coordinated signal control. Using a 3 mile long simulated corridor of US 29 in Greenville, SC, we have evaluated the performance of our CV based adaptive signal control. For the next time interval, using only 5% CV data, the Root Mean Square Error of the machine learning based prediction is 10 vehicles. Our analysis reveals that the CV based adaptive signal control improves operational conditions in the major street compared to the actuated coordinated scenario. Also, using only CV data, the operational performance improves even for a low CV penetration (5% CV), and the benefit increases with increasing CV penetration. We can provide operational benefits to both CVs and non CVs with the limited data from 5% CVs, with 5.6% average speed increase, and 66.7% and 32.4% reduction in average maximum queue length and stopped delay, respectively, in major street coordinated direction compared to the actuated coordinated scenario in the same direction.",2019-07-14T06:26:05Z,2019-07-14T06:26:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07243v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07243v1,eess.SP

The attenuation is estimated by reverse-engineering the effects of the various propagation phenomena affecting the received signal, among which, in first place, the perturbations factors affecting geostationary orbits, such as the gravitational attraction from the moon and the sun and the inhomogeneity in Earth mass distribution and, secondly, the small-scale irregularities in the atmospheric refractive index, causing rapid fluctuations in signal amplitude. The latter impairments, in particular, even if periodically counteracted by correction maneuvers, may give rise to significant departures of the actual satellite position from the nominal orbit. A further problem to deal with is the daily and seasonal random fluctuation of the rain height and altitude/size of the associated melting layer. All of the above issues lead to non-negligible random deviations from the dry nominal downlink attenuation, that can be misinterpreted as rain events. In this paper we show how to counteract these issues by employing two differentially-configured Kalman filters designed to track slow and fast changes of the received signal-to-noise ratio, so that the rain events can be reliably detected and the relevant rainfall rate estimated.",2019-07-24T14:14:33Z,2019-07-24T14:14:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10462v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10462v1,eess.SP
WiEps: Measurement of Dielectric Property with Commodity WiFi Device --   An application to Ethanol/Water Mixture,"Hang Song, Bo Wei, Qun Yu, Xia Xiao, Takamaro Kikkawa","WiFi signal has become accessible everywhere, providing high-speed data transmission experience. Besides the communication service, channel state information (CSI) of the WiFi signals is widely employed for numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Recently, most of these applications are based on analysis of the microwave reflections caused by physical movement of the objective. In this paper, a novel contactless wireless sensing technique named WiEps is developed to measure the dielectric properties of the material, exploiting the transmission characteristics of the WiFi signals. In WiEps, the material under test is placed between the transmitter antenna and receiver antenna. A theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively describe the relationship between CSI data and dielectric properties of the material. During the experiment, the phase and amplitude of the transmitted WiFi signals are extracted from the measured CSI data. The parameters of the theoretical model are calculated using measured data from the known materials. Then, WiEps is utilized to estimate the dielectric properties of unknown materials. The proposed technique is first applied to the ethanol/water mixtures. Then, additional liquids are measured for further verification. The estimated permittivities and conductivities show good agreement with the actual values, with the average error of 4.0% and 8.9%, respectively, indicating the efficacy of WiEps. By measuring the dielectric property, this technique is promising to be applied to new IoT applications using ubiquitous WiFi signals, such as food engineering, material manufacturing process monitoring, and security check.",2020-03-03T16:24:26Z,2020-06-05T16:25:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01622v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01622v2,eess.SP
"Informed trading, limit order book and implementation shortfall:   equilibrium and asymptotics","Umut √áetin, Henri Waelbroeck","We propose a static equilibrium model for limit order book where profit-maximizing investors receive an information signal regarding the liquidation value of the asset and execute via a competitive dealer with random initial inventory, who trades against a competitive limit order book populated by liquidity suppliers. We show that an equilibrium exists for bounded signal distributions, obtain closed form solutions for Bernoulli-type signals and propose a straightforward iterative algorithm to compute the equilibrium order book for the general case. We obtain the exact analytic asymptotics for the market impact of large trades and show that the functional form depends on the tail distribution of the private signal of the insiders. In particular, the impact follows a power law if the signal has fat tails while the law is logarithmic in case of lighter tails. Moreover, the tail distribution of the trade volume in equilibrium obeys a power law in our model. We find that the liquidity suppliers charge a minimum bid-ask spread that is independent of the amount of `noise' trading but increasing in the degree of informational advantage of insiders in equilibrium. The model also predicts that the order book flattens as the amount of noise trading increases converging to a model with proportional transactions costs.. Competition among the insiders leads to aggressive trading causing the aggregate profit to vanish in the limiting case $N\to\infty$. The numerical results also show that the spread increases with the number of insiders keeping the other parameters fixed. Finally, an equilibrium may not exist if the liquidation value is unbounded. We conjecture that existence of equilibrium requires a sufficient amount of competition among insiders if the signal distribution exhibit fat tails.",2020-03-09T21:49:14Z,2020-03-09T21:49:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04425v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04425v1,"q-fin.TR, q-fin.MF"
Optimization of Transmitter-Side Signal Rotations in the Presence of   Laser Phase Noise,"Arni F. Alfredsson, Erik Agrell, Magnus Karlsson, Henk Wymeersch","The effects of transmitter-side multidimensional signal rotations on the performance of multichannel optical transmission are studied in the presence of laser phase noise. In particular, the laser phase noise is assumed to be uncorrelated between channels. To carry out this study, a simple multichannel laser-phase-noise model that has been experimentally validated for weakly-coupled multicore-fiber transmission is considered. As the considered rotation scheme is intended to work in conjunction with receiver-side carrier phase estimation (CPE), the model is modified to further assume that imperfect CPE has taken place, leaving residual phase noise in the processed signal. Based on this model, two receiver structures are derived and used to numerically optimize transmitter-side signal rotations through Monte Carlo simulations. For reasonable amounts of residual phase noise, rotations based on Hadamard matrices are found to be near-optimal for transmission of four-dimensional signals. Furthermore, Hadamard rotations can be performed for any dimension that is a power of two. By exploiting this property, an increase of up to 0.25 bit per complex symbol in an achievable information rate is observed for transmission of higher-order constellations.",2020-03-12T15:48:27Z,2020-03-12T15:48:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05858v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05858v1,eess.SP
Pulsed Waveforms and Intermittently Nonlinear Filtering in Synthesis of   Low-SNR and Covert Communications,"Alexei V. Nikitin, Ruslan L. Davidchack","In traditional spread-spectrum techniques, a wideband transmit signal is obtained by modulating a wideband carrier by a narrowband signal containing a relatively low-rate message. In the receiver, the respective demodulation/despreading restores the information-carrying narrowband signal. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach, where the low-rate information is encoded directly into a wideband waveform of a given bandwidth, without physical ""spreading"" of the carrier's frequency. The main advantages of this approach lie in extended options for encoding the information, and in retaining a reversible control over the temporal and amplitude structures of the modulating wideband waveforms. Significant ""excess bandwidth"" (over that needed to carry the information) enables us to use allpass filters to manage statistical properties and time-domain appearances of these waveforms without changing their spectral composition. For example, a mixture of transmitted waveforms can be shaped as a low-crest-factor signal (e.g. to reduce the burden on the power amplifier), and/or made statistically indistinguishable from Gaussian noise (e.g. for covert transmissions and physical layer steganography), while the selected components of the received waveform can be transformed into high-crest-factor pulse trains suitable for multiplexing and/or low-SNR communications. Further, control over the temporal and amplitude structures of wideband waveforms carrying low-rate information enables effective use of nonlinear filtering techniques. Such techniques can be employed for robust real-time asynchronous extraction of the information, as well as for separation of wideband signal components with identical spectral content from each other. This can facilitate development of a large variety of low-SNR and covert communication configurations.",2020-08-13T15:14:17Z,2020-08-13T15:14:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06390v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06390v1,eess.SP
Foveated Model Observers for Visual Search in 3D Medical Images,"Miguel A. Lago, Craig K. Abbey, Miguel P. Eckstein","Model observers have a long history of success in predicting human observer performance in clinically-relevant detection tasks. New 3D image modalities provide more signal information but vastly increase the search space to be scrutinized. Here, we compared standard linear model observers (ideal observers, non-pre-whitening matched filter with eye filter, and various versions of Channelized Hotelling models) to human performance searching in 3D 1/f$^{2.8}$ filtered noise images and assessed its relationship to the more traditional location known exactly detection tasks and 2D search. We investigated two different signal types that vary in their detectability away from the point of fixation (visual periphery). We show that the influence of 3D search on human performance interacts with the signal's detectability in the visual periphery. Detection performance for signals difficult to detect in the visual periphery deteriorates greatly in 3D search but not in 3D location known exactly and 2D search. Standard model observers do not predict the interaction between 3D search and signal type. A proposed extension of the Channelized Hotelling model (foveated search model) that processes the image with reduced spatial detail away from the point of fixation, explores the image through eye movements, and scrolls across slices can successfully predict the interaction observed in humans and also the types of errors in 3D search. Together, the findings highlight the need for foveated model observers for image quality evaluation with 3D search.",2020-11-03T01:15:37Z,2020-11-03T01:15:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01405v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01405v1,eess.SP
Flight Sensor Data and Beamforming based Integrated UAV Tracking with   Channel Estimation using Gaussian Process Regression,"Ha-Lim Song, Young-Chai Ko","With explosively increasing demands for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, reliable link acquisition for serving UAVs is required. Considering the dynamic characteristics of UAV, it is hugely challenging to persist a reliable link without beam misalignment. In this paper, we propose a flight sensor data and beamforming signal based integrated UAV tracking scheme to deal with this problem. The proposed scheme provides a compatible integrated system considering the practical specification of the flight sensor data and the beamforming pilot signal. The UAV position tracking is comprised of two steps: 1) UAV position prediction by the flight sensor data and 2) position update with the beamforming signal using Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, which is a nonparametric machine learning. The flight sensor data can assist ground station (GS) or UAV nodes in designing the precoding and the receive beamforming matrix with drastically reduced overheads. The beamforming signal can accomplish high beamforming gain to be maintained even when the flight sensor data is absent. Therefore, the proposed scheme can support the moving target continuously by utilizing these two signals. The simulation results are provided to confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms other conventional beam tracking schemes. We also derive 3-dimensional (3D) beamforming gain and spectral efficiency (SE) from the mean absolute error (MAE) of the angular value estimation, which can be used as beamforming performance metrics of the data transmission link in advance.",2020-11-20T02:30:39Z,2020-11-20T02:30:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10177v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10177v1,eess.SP
Filters for ISI Suppression in Molecular Communication via Diffusion,"Ruifeng Zheng, Lin Lin, Hao Yan","Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is considered as one of the most feasible communication paradigms for nanonetworks, especially for bio-nanonetworks which are usually in water-rich biological environments. Two effects that deteriorates the signal in MCvD are noise and inter-symbol interference (ISI). The expected channel impulse response of MCvD has a long and slow attenuating tail due to molecular diffusion which causes ISI and further limits the slow data rate of MCvD. The extent that ISI and noise are suppressed in an MCvD system determines its effectiveness, especially at a high data rate. Although ISI-suppression approaches have been investigated, most of them are addressed as non-essential parts in other topics, such as signal detection or modulation. Furthermore, most of the state-of-the-art ISI-suppression approaches are performed by subtracting the estimated ISI from the total signal. In this work, we investigate ISI-suppression from a new perspective of filters to filter ISI out without any ISI estimation. The principles for a good design of ISI-suppression filters in MCvD are investigated. Based on the principles, an ISI-suppression filter with good anti-noise capability and an associated signal detection scheme is proposed for MCvD scenarios with both ISI and noise. We compare the proposed scheme with the state-of-the-art ISI-suppression approaches. The result manifests that the proposed ISI-suppression scheme could recover signals deteriorated severely by both ISI and noise, which could not be effectively detected by the state-of-the-art ISI-suppression approaches.",2021-04-29T07:58:00Z,2022-04-13T14:02:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14174v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14174v3,eess.SP
A New Signal Representation Using Complex Conjugate Pair Sums,"Shaik Basheeruddin Shah, Vijay Kumar Chakka, Arikatla Satyanarayana Reddy","This letter introduces a real valued summation known as Complex Conjugate Pair Sum (CCPS). The space spanned by CCPS and its one circular downshift is called {\em Complex Conjugate Subspace (CCS)}. For a given positive integer $N\geq3$, there exists $\frac{\varphi(N)}{2}$ CCPSs forming $\frac{\varphi(N)}{2}$ CCSs, where $\varphi(N)$ is the Euler's totient function. We prove that these CCSs are mutually orthogonal and their direct sum form a $\varphi(N)$ dimensional subspace $s_N$ of $\mathbb{C}^N$. We propose that any signal of finite length $N$ is represented as a linear combination of elements from a special basis of $s_d$, for each divisor $d$ of $N$. This defines a new transform named as Complex Conjugate Periodic Transform (CCPT). Later, we compared CCPT with DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and RPT (Ramanujan Periodic Transform). It is shown that, using CCPT we can estimate the period, hidden periods and frequency information of a signal. Whereas, RPT does not provide the frequency information. For a complex valued input signal, CCPT offers computational benefit over DFT. A CCPT dictionary based method is proposed to extract non-divisor period information.",2021-06-20T15:14:55Z,2021-06-20T15:14:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10710v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10710v1,eess.SP
A Preliminary Study on Automatic Motion Artifacts Detection in   Electrodermal Activity Data Using Machine Learning,"Md Billal Hossain, Hugo Fernando Posada-Quintero, Youngsun Kong, Riley McNaboe, Ki Chon","The electrodermal activity (EDA) signal is a sensitive and non-invasive surrogate measure of sympathetic function. Use of EDA has increased in popularity in recent years for such applications as emotion and stress recognition; assessment of pain, fatigue, and sleepiness; diagnosis of depression and epilepsy; and other uses. Recently, there have been several studies using ambulatory EDA recordings, which are often quite useful for analysis of many physiological conditions. Because ambulatory monitoring uses wearable devices, EDA signals are often affected by noise and motion artifacts. An automated noise and motion artifact detection algorithm is therefore of utmost importance for accurate analysis and evaluation of EDA signals. In this paper, we present machine learning-based algorithms for motion artifact detection in EDA signals. With ten subjects, we collected two simultaneous EDA signals from the right and left hands, while instructing the subjects to move only the right hand. Using these data, we proposed a cross-correlation-based approach for non-biased labeling of EDA data segments. A set of statistical, spectral and model-based features were calculated which were then subjected to a feature selection algorithm. Finally, we trained and validated several machine learning methods using a leave-one-subject-out approach. The classification accuracy of the developed model was 83.85% with a standard deviation of 4.91%, which was better than a recent standard method that we considered for comparison to our algorithm.",2021-07-16T00:18:48Z,2021-07-16T00:18:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07650v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07650v1,eess.SP
Three-dimensional instantaneous orbit map for rotor-bearing system based   on a novel multivariate complex variational mode decomposition algorithm,"Xiaolong Cui, Jie Huang, Chaoshun Li, Yujie Zhao","Full spectrum and holospectrum are homogenous information fusion technology developed for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, which is extensively exploited in the analysis of the orbits of rotor-bearing systems. However, they are not adapted for non-stationary signals, nor can they be used for fusion analysis of vibrations of multiple bearing sections. By drawing inspiration from the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and the complex-valued signal decomposition, we propose a method called multivariate complex variational mode decomposition (MCVMD). It can simultaneously extract the forward and backward components of multiple bearing sections and realize non-stationary complex signal decomposition of multiple bearing sections of the rotor. To achieve the visualization goal of condition monitoring, we propose the three-dimensional instantaneous orbit map (3D-IOM). It enables more features of shaft vibration of a rotor system to be displayed and offers a new way for the fusion analysis of vibration signals of multiple bearing sections of rotating machinery. Furthermore, making the most of the joint information, we also provide a high-resolution time-full spectrum (Time-FS) to display the forward and backward frequency components of multiple bearing sections. The effectiveness of the proposed method through both the simulated experiment and the real-life complex-valued signals is demonstrated in this paper.",2021-07-29T04:26:44Z,2022-04-25T02:37:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13740v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13740v2,eess.SP
Detailed analysis and comparison of different activity metrics,"B√°lint Macz√°k, Gergely Vadai, Andr√°s D√©r, Istv√°n Szendi, Zolt√°n Gingl","Actigraphic measurements are an important part of research in different disciplines, yet the procedure of determining activity values is unexpectedly not standardized in the literature. Although the measured raw acceleration signal can be diversely processed, and then the activity values can be calculated by different activity calculation methods, the documentations of them are generally incomplete or vary by manufacturer. These numerous activity metrics may require different types of preprocessing of the acceleration signal. For example, digital filtering of the acceleration signals can have various parameters; moreover, both the filter and the activity metrics can also be applied per axis or on the magnitudes of the acceleration vector. Level crossing-based activity metrics also depend on unclearly determined threshold level values. Due to the serious inconsistency of determining activity values, we created a detailed and comprehensive comparison of the different available activity calculation procedures because, up to the present, it was lacking in the literature. We assessed the different methods by analysing the triaxial acceleration signals measured during a 10-day movement of 42 subjects. We calculated 148 different activity signals for each subject's movement using the combinations of various types of preprocessing and 7 different activity metrics applied on both axial and magnitude data. We determined the linear relationship between the metrics by correlation analysis, while we also examined the effects of the preprocessing steps. Moreover, we established that the standard deviation of the data series can be used as an appropriate, adaptive and generalized threshold level for the level intersection-based metrics. On the basis of these results, our work also serves as a general guide on how to proceed if one wants to determine activity from the raw acceleration data.",2021-09-03T12:07:36Z,2021-09-03T12:07:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01468v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01468v1,eess.SP
Integrating Low-Complexity and Flexible Sensing into Communication   Systems,"Kai Wu, J. Andrew Zhang, Xiaojing Huang, Y. Jay Guo","Integrating sensing into standardized communication systems can potentially benefit many consumer applications that require both radio frequency functions. However, without an effective sensing method, such integration may not achieve the expected gains of cost and energy efficiency. Existing sensing methods, which use communication payload signals, either have limited sensing performance or suffer from high complexity. In this paper, we develop a novel and flexible sensing framework which has a complexity only dominated by a Fourier transform and also provides the flexibility in adapting for different sensing needs. We propose to segment a whole block of echo signal evenly into sub-blocks; adjacent ones are allowed to overlap. We design a virtual cyclic prefix (VCP) for each sub-block that allows us to employ two common ways of removing communication data symbols and generate two types of range-Doppler maps (RDMs) for sensing. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the signal components in the RDMs, proving that their interference-plus-noise (IN) terms are approximately Gaussian distributed. The statistical properties of the distributions are derived, which leads to the analytical comparisons between the two RDMs as well as between the prior and our sensing methods. Moreover, the impact of the lengths of sub-block, VCP and overlapping signal on sensing performance is analyzed. Criteria for designing these lengths for better sensing performance are also provided. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of the proposed sensing framework over prior methods in terms of signal-to-IN ratios in RDMs, detecting performance and flexibility.",2021-09-09T09:02:54Z,2021-09-09T09:02:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04109v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04109v1,eess.SP
Feasibility of Modeling Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing   Communication Signals with Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Networks,"Jack Sklar, Adam Wunderlich","High-quality recordings of radio frequency (RF) emissions from commercial communication hardware in realistic environments are often needed to develop and assess spectrum-sharing technologies and practices, e.g., for training and testing spectrum sensing algorithms and for interference testing. Unfortunately, the time-consuming, expensive nature of such data collections together with data-sharing restrictions pose significant challenges that limit data set availability. Furthermore, developing accurate models of real-world RF emissions from first principles is often very difficult because system parameters and implementation details are at best only partially known, and complex system dynamics are difficult to characterize. Hence, there is a need for flexible, data-driven methods that can leverage existing data sets to synthesize additional similar waveforms. One promising machine-learning approach is unsupervised deep generative modeling with generative adversarial networks (GANs). To date, GANs for RF communication signals have not been studied thoroughly. In this paper, we present the first in-depth investigation of generated signal fidelity for GANs trained with baseband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, where each subcarrier is digitally modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Building on prior GAN methods, we developed two novel GAN models and evaluated their performance using simulated data sets with known ground truth. Specifically, we investigated model performance with respect to increasing data set complexity over a range of OFDM parameters and conditions, including fading channels. The findings presented here inform the feasibility of use cases and provide a foundation for further investigations into deep generative models for RF communication signals.",2021-09-10T21:07:16Z,2022-02-18T00:31:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05107v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05107v2,eess.SP
An Analog Signal Processing EIC-PIC Solution for Coherent Data Center   Interconnects,"Shivangi Chugh, Rakesh Ashok, Punit Jain, Sana Naaz, Aboobackkar Sidhique, Shalabh Gupta","Data center interconnects (DCIs) will have to support throughputs of 400 Gbps or more per wavelength in the near future. To achieve such high data rates, coherent modulation and detection is used, which conventionally requires high-speed data conversion and signal processing in the digital domain. Alternatively, high-speed signal conditioning and processing could be carried out in co-designed photonic and electronic integrated circuits, in the optical and electrical analog domains, respectively, to achieve reduced power consumption, latency, form factor, and cost. A few demonstrations of analog domain processing electronic integrated circuits (EICs), including those of equalizer and carrier phase recovery (CPR) modules showcase progress in this direction in the literature. In this brief, for the first time, we present integration of a silicon photonic integrated coherent receiver (ICR) module with a CPR module, as a part of a complete coherent receiver solution. A phase shifter in the ICR (fabricated in a 220 nm silicon-on-insulator technology) receives feedback from a CPR EIC, and the combination compensates for the time varying phase offset between the modulated signal and the unmodulated carrier in the closed loop configuration. In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we present experimental results obtained from the stand-alone silicon photonic ICR along with its system level integration with CPR chip, for QPSK signals. The technique can be extended to a higher-order modulation format, such as 16-QAM, for data rate scaling. The proposed scheme is suitable for homodyne systems, such as polarization multiplexed carrier based self-homodyne links.",2022-02-18T06:18:19Z,2022-02-18T06:18:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09040v1,eess.SP
Multiband Delay Estimation for Localization Using a Two-Stage Global   Estimation Scheme,"Yubo Wan, An Liu, Qiyu Hu, Mianyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai","The time of arrival (TOA)-based localization techniques, which need to estimate the delay of the line-of-sight (LoS) path, have been widely employed in location-aware networks. To achieve a high-accuracy delay estimation, a number of multiband-based algorithms have been proposed recently, which exploit the channel state information (CSI) measurements over multiple non-contiguous frequency bands. However, to the best of our knowledge, there still lacks an efficient scheme that fully exploits the multiband gains when the phase distortion factors caused by hardware imperfections are considered, due to that the associated multi-parameter estimation problem contains many local optimums and the existing algorithms can easily get stuck in a ""bad"" local optimum. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage global estimation (TSGE) scheme for multiband delay estimation. In the coarse stage, we exploit the group sparsity structure of the multiband channel and propose a Turbo Bayesian inference (Turbo-BI) algorithm to achieve a good initial delay estimation based on a coarse signal model, which is transformed from the original multiband signal model by absorbing the carrier frequency terms. The estimation problem derived from the coarse signal model contains less local optimums and thus a more stable estimation can be achieved than directly using the original signal model. Then in the refined stage, with the help of coarse estimation results to narrow down the search range, we perform a global delay estimation using a particle swarm optimization-least square (PSO-LS) algorithm based on a refined multiband signal model to exploit the multiband gains to further improve the estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed TSGE significantly outperforms the benchmarks with comparative computational complexity.",2022-06-20T12:59:21Z,2022-06-20T12:59:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09751v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09751v1,eess.SP
Event-based sampled ECG morphology reconstruction through   self-similarity,"Silvio Zanoli, Tomas Teijeiro, Giovanni Ansaloni, David Atienza","Background and Objective: Event-based analog-to-digital converters allow for sparse bio-signal acquisition, enabling local sub-Nyquist sampling frequency. However, aggressive event selection can cause the loss of important bio-markers, not recoverable with standard interpolation techniques. In this work, we leverage the self-similarity of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to recover missing features in event-based sampled ECG signals, dynamically selecting patient-representative templates together with a novel dynamic time warping algorithm to infer the morphology of event-based sampled heartbeats.   Methods: We acquire a set of uniformly sampled heartbeats and use a graph-based clustering algorithm to define representative templates for the patient. Then, for each event-based sampled heartbeat, we select the morphologically nearest template, and we then reconstruct the heartbeat with piece-wise linear deformations of the selected template, according to a novel dynamic time warping algorithm that matches events to template segments.   Results: Synthetic tests on a standard normal sinus rhythm dataset, composed of approximately 1.8 million normal heartbeats, show a big leap in performance with respect to standard resampling techniques. In particular (when compared to classic linear resampling), we show an improvement in P-wave detection of up to 10 times, an improvement in T-wave detection of up to three times, and a 30\% improvement in the dynamic time warping morphological distance.   Conclusion: In this work, we have developed an event-based processing pipeline that leverages signal self-similarity to reconstruct event-based sampled ECG signals.

Regularity-Constrained Fast Sine Transforms,"Taizo Suzuki, Seisuke Kyochi, Yuichi Tanaka","This letter proposes a fast implementation of the regularity-constrained discrete sine transform (R-DST). The original DST \textit{leaks} the lowest frequency (DC: direct current) components of signals into high frequency (AC: alternating current) subbands. This property is not desired in many applications, particularly image processing, since most of the frequency components in natural images concentrate in DC subband. The characteristic of filter banks whereby they do not leak DC components into the AC subbands is called \textit{regularity}. While an R-DST has been proposed, it has no fast implementation because of the singular value decomposition (SVD) in its internal algorithm. In contrast, the proposed regularity-constrained fast sine transform (R-FST) is obtained by just appending a regularity constraint matrix as a postprocessing of the original DST. When the DST size is $M\times M$ ($M=2^\ell$, $\ell\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}$), the regularity constraint matrix is constructed from only $M/2-1$ rotation matrices with the angles derived from the output of the DST for the constant-valued signal (i.e., the DC signal). Since it does not require SVD, the computation is simpler and faster than the R-DST while keeping all of its beneficial properties. An image processing example shows that the R-FST has fine frequency selectivity with no DC leakage and higher coding gain than the original DST. Also, in the case of $M=8$, the R-FST saved approximately $0.126$ seconds in a 2-D transformation of $512\times 512$ signals compared with the R-DST because of fewer extra operations.",2022-07-27T05:13:28Z,2023-09-20T02:30:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13301v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13301v2,"eess.SP, eess.IV"
A Unified Algorithmic Framework for Distributed Adaptive Signal and   Feature Fusion Problems -- Part I: Algorithm Derivation,"Cem Ates Musluoglu, Alexander Bertrand","In this paper, we describe a general algorithmic framework for solving linear signal or feature fusion optimization problems in a distributed setting, for example in a wireless sensor network (WSN). These problems require linearly combining the observed signals (or features thereof) collected at the various sensor nodes to satisfy a pre-defined optimization criterion. The framework covers several classical spatial filtering problems, including minimum variance beamformers, multi-channel Wiener filters, principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, (generalized) eigenvalue problems, etc. The proposed distributed adaptive signal fusion (DASF) algorithm is an iterative method that solves these types of problems by allowing each node to share a linearly compressed version of the local sensor signal observations with its neighbors to reduce the energy and bandwidth requirements of the network. We first discuss the case of fully-connected networks and then extend the analysis to more general network topologies. The general DASF algorithm is shown to have several existing distributed algorithms from the literature as a special case, while at the same time allowing to solve new distributed problems as well with guaranteed convergence and optimality. This paper focuses on the algorithm derivation of the DASF framework along with simulations demonstrating its performance. A technical analysis along with convergence conditions and proofs are provided in a companion paper.",2022-08-18T14:45:12Z,2023-05-11T12:46:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08867v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08867v2,eess.SP
Model Order Estimation in the Presence of multipath Interference using   Residual Convolutional Neural Networks,"Jianyuan Yu, William W. Howard, Yue Xu, R. Michael Buehrer","Model order estimation (MOE) is often a pre-requisite for Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation. Due to limits imposed by array geometry, it is typically not possible to estimate spatial parameters for an arbitrary number of sources; an estimate of the signal model is usually required. MOE is the process of selecting the most likely signal model from several candidates. While classic methods fail at MOE in the presence of coherent multipath interference, data-driven supervised learning models can solve this problem. Instead of the classic MLP (Multiple Layer Perceptions) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) architectures, we propose the application of Residual Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), with grouped symmetric kernel filters to deliver state-of-art estimation accuracy of up to 95.2\% in the presence of coherent multipath, and a weighted loss function to eliminate underestimation error of the model order. We show the benefit of the approach by demonstrating its impact on an overall signal processing flow that determines the number of total signals received by the array, the number of independent sources, and the association of each of the paths with those sources . Moreover, we show that the proposed estimator provides accurate performance over a variety of array types, can identify the overloaded scenario, and ultimately provides strong DoA estimation and signal association performance.",2022-09-01T21:05:51Z,2022-09-01T21:05:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00728v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00728v1,eess.SP
A Combined Model for Noise Reduction of Lung Sound Signals Based on   Empirical Mode Decomposition and Artificial Neural Network,"Mozhde Firoozi Pouyani, Mansour Vali, Mohammad Amin Ghasemi","Computer analysis of Lung Sound (LS) signals has been proposed in recent years as a tool to analyze the lungs' status but there have always been main challenges, including the contamination of LS with environmental noises, which come from different sources of unlike intensities. One of the common methods in noise reduction of LS signals is based on thresholding on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficients or Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) of the signal, however, in these methods, it is necessary to calculate the SNR value to determine the appropriate threshold for noise removal. To solve this problem, a combined model based on EMD and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained with different SNRs (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20dB) is proposed in this research. The model can denoise white and pink noises in the range of -2 to 20dB without thresholding or even estimating SNR, and at the same time, keep the main content of the LS signal well. The proposed method is also compared with the EMD-custom method, and the results obtained from the SNR, and fit criteria indicate the absolute superiority of the proposed method. For example, at SNR = 0dB, the combined method can improve the SNR by 9.41 and 8.23dB for white and pink noises, respectively, while the corresponding values are respectively 5.89 and 4.31dB for the EMD-Custom method.",2022-09-20T07:04:23Z,2022-09-20T07:04:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09512v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09512v1,"eess.AS, eess.SP"
Robust Graph Filter Identification and Graph Denoising from Signal   Observations,"Samuel Rey, Victor M. Tenorio, Antonio G. Marques","When facing graph signal processing tasks, the workhorse assumption is that the graph describing the support of the signals is known. However, in many relevant applications the available graph suffers from observation errors and perturbations. As a result, any method relying on the graph topology may yield suboptimal results if those imperfections are ignored. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for handling perturbations on the links of the graph and apply it to the problem of robust graph filter (GF) identification from input-output observations. Different from existing works, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem that operates in the vertex domain and jointly performs GF identification and graph denoising. As a result, on top of learning the desired GF, an estimate of the graph is obtained as a byproduct. To handle the resulting bi-convex problem, we design an algorithm that blends techniques from alternating optimization and majorization minimization, showing its convergence to a stationary point. The second part of the paper i) generalizes the design to a robust setup where several GFs are jointly estimated, and ii) introduces an alternative algorithmic implementation that reduces the computational complexity. Finally, the detrimental influence of the perturbations and the benefits resulting from the robust approach are numerically analyzed over synthetic and real-world datasets, comparing them with other state-of-the-art alternatives.",2022-10-16T08:50:25Z,2022-10-16T08:50:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08488v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08488v1,eess.SP

We show that all $d$-dimensional quaternion signals can be reconstructed up to a global right quaternion phase factor from $O(d)$ phaseless measurements. We also develop the scalable algorithm quaternion Wirtinger flow (QWF) for solving QPR, and establish its linear convergence guarantee. Compared with the analysis of complex Wirtinger flow, a series of different treatments are employed to overcome the difficulties of the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Moreover, we develop a variant of QWF that can effectively utilize a pure quaternion priori (e.g., for color images) by incorporating a quaternion phase factor estimate into QWF iterations. The estimate can be computed efficiently as it amounts to finding a singular vector of a $4\times 4$ real matrix. Motivated by the variants of Wirtinger flow in prior work, we further propose quaternion truncated Wirtinger flow (QTWF), quaternion truncated amplitude flow (QTAF) and their pure quaternion versions. Experimental results on synthetic data and color images are presented to validate our theoretical results. In particular, for pure quaternion signal recovery, our quaternion method often succeeds with measurements notably fewer than real methods based on monochromatic model or concatenation model.",2022-10-25T17:03:32Z,2023-07-23T06:04:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14170v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14170v3,eess.SP
Definition and Quantification of Shock/Impact/Transient Vibrations,"Pontus Johannisson, Hans Lindell","Vibration injury in the hand-arm system from hand-held machines is one of the most common occupational health injuries and causes severe and often chronic nerve and vascular injury to the operator. Machines emitting shock vibrations, e.g., impact wrenches have since long been identified as a special risk factor. In legislative and standard texts the terms shock, impact, and transient vibration are frequently used to underline the special risk associated with these kinds of vibrations. In spite of this, there is no mathematically stringent definition what a shock vibration is or how the amplitude of the shock is defined. This lack of definitions is the subject of this article. This document discusses a number of candidate definitions for a vibration shock index (VSI) that quantifies different vibration signals in terms of how localized they are in the time domain. The VSI is intended to be used to classify and compare different vibration sources. The VSI is independent of the vibration level, i.e., it is unchanged if the vibration signal is rescaled. The traditional root mean square method to determine the vibration level will not produce a value representative for the shocks occurring in a signal with high VSI. Thus, there is a need for a complementing quantification method for the localized signal parts. Possible definitions for such a vibration shock level (VSL) are suggested. A problem formulation is first stated together with a description of the approach used for designing the VSI and the VSL. After this, model signals are defined, which are used to discuss and evaluate the different candidate definitions. Then, a number of candidate definitions are discussed, leading up to a conclusion on which candidate definitions that are promising for experimental evaluation.",2022-11-16T15:54:52Z,2022-11-16T15:54:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08999v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08999v1,eess.SP
Communication under Mixed Gaussian-Impulsive Channel: An End-to-End   Framework,"Chengjie Zhao, Jun Wang, Wei Huang, Xiaonan Chen, Tianfu Qi","In many communication scenarios, the communication signals simultaneously suffer from white Gaussian noise (WGN) and non-Gaussian impulsive noise (IN), i.e., mixed Gaussian-impulsive noise (MGIN). Under MGIN channel, classical communication signal schemes and corresponding detection methods usually can not achieve desirable performance as they are optimized with respect to WGN. Moreover, as the widely adopted IN model has no analytical and general closed-form expression of probability density function (PDF), it is extremely hard to obtain optimal communication signal and corresponding detection schemes based on classical stochastic signal processing theory. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a data-driven end-to-end framework to address the communication signal design and detection under MGIN channel in this paper. In this proposed framework, a channel noise simulator (CNS) is elaborately designed based on an improved generative adversarial net (GAN) to simulate the MGIN without requirement of any analytical PDF. Meanwhile, a multi-level wavelet convolutional neural network (MWCNN) based preprocessing network is used to mitigate the negative effect of outliers due to the IN. Compared with conventional approaches and existing end-to-end systems, extensive simulation results verify that our proposed novel end-to-end communication system can achieve better performance in terms of bit-error rate (BER) under MGIN environments.",2023-01-19T07:27:36Z,2023-01-19T07:27:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07925v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07925v1,eess.SP
Index analysis: an approach to understand signal transduction with   application to the EGFR signalling pathway,"Jane Kn√∂chel, Charlotte Kloft, Wilhelm Huisinga","In systems biology and pharmacology, large-scale kinetic models are used to study the dynamic response of a system to a specific input or stimulus. While in many applications, a deeper understanding of the input-response behaviour is highly desirable, it is often hindered by the large number of molecular species and the complexity of the interactions. An approach that identifies key molecular species for a given input-response relationship and characterises dynamic properties of states is therefore highly desirable. We introduce the concept of index analysis; it is based on different time- and state-dependent quantities (indices) to identify important dynamic characteristics of molecular species. All indices are defined for a specific pair of input and response variables as well as for a specific magnitude of the input. In application to a large-scale kinetic model of the EGFR signalling cascade, we identified different phases of signal transduction, the peculiar role of Phosphatase3 during signal activation and Ras recycling during signal onset. In addition, we discuss the challenges and pitfalls of interpreting the relevance of molecular species based on knock-out simulation studies, and provide an alternative view on conflicting results on the importance of parallel EGFR downstream pathways. We envision that index analysis will be beneficial in comparing different model scenarios (e.g., healthy and diseased conditions), in designing more informed model reduction approaches, and in translating large-scale systems biology models from early to late phase in drug discovery and development.",2023-02-17T11:19:02Z,2023-02-17T11:19:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08815v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08815v1,q-bio.QM
Comparison of different versions of SignalP and TargetP for diatom   plastid protein predictions with ASAFind,"Ansgar Gruber, Cedar McKay, Gabrielle Rocap, Miroslav Oborn√≠k","Plastid targeted proteins of diatoms and related algae can be predicted with high sensitivity and specificity using the ASAFind method published in 2015. ASAFind predictions rely on SignalP predictions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting signal peptides. Recently (in 2019), a new version of SignalP was released, SignalP 5.0. We tested the ability of SignalP 5.0 to recognize signal peptides of nucleus-encoded, plastid-targeted diatom pre-proteins, and to identify the signal peptide cleavage site. The results were compared to manual predictions of the characteristic cleavage site motif, and to previous versions of SignalP. SignalP 5.0 is less sensitive than the previous versions of SignalP in this specific task, and also in the detection of signal peptides of non-plastid proteins in diatoms. However, in combination with ASAFind, the resulting prediction performance for plastid proteins is high. In addition, we tested the multi-location prediction tool TargetP for its suitability to provide signal peptide information to ASAFind. The newest version, TargetP 2.0, had the highest prediction performances for diatom signal peptides and mitochondrial transit peptides compared to other versions of SignalP and TargetP, thus it provides a good basis for ASAFind predictions.",2023-03-04T21:37:55Z,2023-03-04T21:37:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02509v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02509v1,q-bio.SC
In-Situ Calibration of Antenna Arrays for Positioning With 5G Networks,"Mengguan Pan, Shengheng Liu, Peng Liu, Wangdong Qi, Yongming Huang, Wang Zheng, Qihui Wu, Markus Gardill","Owing to the ubiquity of cellular communication signals, positioning with the fifth generation (5G) signal has emerged as a promising solution in global navigation satellite system-denied areas. Unfortunately, although the widely employed antenna arrays in 5G remote radio units (RRUs) facilitate the measurement of the direction of arrival (DOA), DOA-based positioning performance is severely degraded by array errors. This paper proposes an in-situ calibration framework with a user terminal transmitting 5G reference signals at several known positions in the actual operating environment and the accessible RRUs estimating their array errors from these reference signals. Further, since sub-6GHz small-cell RRUs deployed for indoor coverage generally have small-aperture antenna arrays, while 5G signals have plentiful bandwidth resources, this work segregates the multipath components via super-resolution delay estimation based on the maximum likelihood criteria. This differs significantly from existing in-situ calibration works which resolve multipaths in the spatial domain. The superiority of the proposed method is first verified by numerical simulations. We then demonstrate via field test with commercial 5G equipment that, a reduction of 46.7% for 1-${\sigma}$ DOA estimation error can be achieved by in-situ calibration using the proposed method.",2023-03-08T09:42:33Z,2023-03-08T09:42:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04470v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04470v1,eess.SP
Mathematical Characterization of Signal Semantics and Rethinking of the   Mathematical Theory of Information,"Guangming Shi, Dahua Gao, Shuai Ma, Minxi Yang, Yong Xiao, Xuemei Xie","Shannon information theory is established based on probability and bits, and the communication technology based on this theory realizes the information age. The original goal of Shannon's information theory is to describe and transmit information content. However, due to information is related to cognition, and cognition is considered to be subjective, Shannon information theory is to describe and transmit information-bearing signals. With the development of the information age to the intelligent age, the traditional signal-oriented processing needs to be upgraded to content-oriented processing. For example, chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) has initially realized the content processing capability based on massive data. For many years, researchers have been searching for the answer to what the information content in the signal is, because only when the information content is mathematically and accurately described can information-based machines be truly intelligent. This paper starts from rethinking the essence of the basic concepts of the information, such as semantics, meaning, information and knowledge, presents the mathematical characterization of the information content, investigate the relationship between them, studies the transformation from Shannon's signal information theory to semantic information theory, and therefore proposes a content-oriented semantic communication framework. Furthermore, we propose semantic decomposition and composition scheme to achieve conversion between complex and simple semantics. Finally, we verify the proposed characterization of information-related concepts by implementing evolvable knowledge-based semantic recognition.",2023-03-26T12:08:27Z,2023-03-26T12:08:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14701v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14701v1,eess.SP
YOLO: An Efficient Terahertz Band Integrated Sensing and Communications   Scheme with Beam Squint,"Hongliang Luo, Feifei Gao, Hai Lin, Shaodan Ma, H. Vincent Poor","Using communications signals for dynamic target sensing is an important component of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). In this paper, we propose to utilize the beam squint effect to realize fast non-cooperative dynamic target sensing in massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) Terahertz band communications systems. Specifically, we construct a wideband channel model of the echo signals, and design a beamforming strategy that controls the range of beam squint by adjusting the values of phase shifters and true time delay lines. With this design, beams at different subcarriers can be aligned along different directions in a planned way. Then the received echo signals at different subcarriers will carry target information in different directions, based on which the targets' angles can be estimated through sophisticatedly designed algorithm. Moreover, we propose a supporting method based on extended array signal estimation, which utilizes the phase changes of different frequency subcarriers within different OFDM symbols to estimate the distance and velocity of dynamic targets. Interestingly, the proposed sensing scheme only needs to transmit and receive the signals once, which can be termed as You Only Listen Once (YOLO). Compared with the traditional ISAC method that requires time consuming beam sweeping, the proposed one greatly reduces the sensing overhead. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",2023-05-20T02:53:55Z,2024-02-06T03:54:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12064v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12064v3,eess.SP
Frequency Estimation Using Complex-Valued Shifted Window Transformer,"Josiah W. Smith, Murat Torlak","Estimating closely spaced frequency components of a signal is a fundamental problem in statistical signal processing. In this letter, we introduce 1-D real-valued and complex-valued shifted window (Swin) transformers, referred to as SwinFreq and CVSwinFreq, respectively, for line-spectra frequency estimation on 1-D complex-valued signals. Whereas 2-D Swin transformer-based models have gained traction for optical image super-resolution, we introduce for the first time a complex-valued Swin module designed to leverage the complex-valued nature of signals for a wide array of applications. The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of the classical algorithms such as the periodogram, MUSIC, and OMP in addition to state-of-the-art deep learning approach cResFreq. SwinFreq and CVSwinFreq boast superior performance at low signal-to-noise ratio SNR and improved resolution capability while requiring fewer model parameters than cResFreq, thus deeming it more suitable for edge and mobile applications. We find that the real-valued Swin-Freq outperforms its complex-valued counterpart CVSwinFreq for several tasks while touting a smaller model size. Finally, we apply the proposed techniques for radar range profile super-resolution using real data. The results from both synthetic and real experimentation validate the numerical and empirical superiority of SwinFreq and CVSwinFreq to the state-of-the-art deep learning-based techniques and traditional frequency estimation algorithms.

Soft Demodulator for Symbol-Level Precoding in Coded Multiuser MISO   Systems,"Yafei Wang, Hongwei Hou, Wenjin Wang, Xinping Yi, Shi Jin","In this paper, we consider symbol-level precoding (SLP) in channel-coded multiuser multi-input single-output (MISO) systems. It is observed that the received SLP signals do not always follow Gaussian distribution, rendering the conventional soft demodulation with the Gaussian assumption unsuitable for the coded SLP systems. It, therefore, calls for novel soft demodulator designs for non-Gaussian distributed SLP signals with accurate log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation. To this end, we first investigate the non-Gaussian characteristics of both phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) received signals with existing SLP schemes and categorize the signals into two distinct types. The first type exhibits an approximate-Gaussian distribution with the outliers extending along the constructive interference region (CIR). In contrast, the second type follows some distribution that significantly deviates from the Gaussian distribution. To obtain accurate LLR, we propose the modified Gaussian soft demodulator and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) soft demodulators to deal with two types of signals respectively. Subsequently, to further reduce the computational complexity and pilot overhead, we put forward a novel neural soft demodulator, named pilot feature extraction network (PFEN), leveraging the transformer mechanism in deep learning. Simulation results show that the proposed soft demodulators dramatically improve the throughput of existing SLPs for both PSK and QAM transmission in coded systems.",2023-10-16T11:32:05Z,2023-10-16T11:32:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10296v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10296v1,eess.SP

In light of this imperative, we propose an innovative fusion algorithm based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), which aims to deal with the difficulty in applying deep learning (DL) algorithms due to the instantaneous nature of jamming signals in practical communication systems. Compared with previous methods, our algorithm embeds jamming category labels to constrain the range of generated signals in the frequency domain by using the CGAN model, which simultaneously captures potential label information while learning the distribution of signal data thus achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy even when working with a few-sample dataset. Real-world satellite communication scenarios are simulated by adopting hardware platform, and we validate our algorithm by using the resulting time-domain waveform data. The experimental results indicate that our algorithm still performs extremely well, which demonstrates significant potential for practical application in real-world communication scenarios.",2023-11-09T11:03:26Z,2024-06-26T07:43:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05273v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05273v3,eess.SP
Robust Multidimensional Graph Neural Networks for Signal Processing in   Wireless Communications with Edge-Graph Information Bottleneck,"Ziheng Liu, Jiayi Zhang, Yiyang Zhu, Enyu Shi, Bo Ai","Signal processing is crucial for satisfying the high data rate requirements of future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, the rapid growth of wireless networks has brought about massive data traffic, which hinders the application of traditional optimization theory-based algorithms. Meanwhile, traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) focus on compressing inputs onto vertices to update representations, which often leads to their inability to effectively distinguish input features and severely weakens performance. In this context, designing efficient signal processing frameworks becomes imperative. Moreover, actual scenarios are susceptible to multipath interference and noise, resulting in specific differences between the received and actual information. To address these challenges, this paper incorporates multidimensional graph neural networks (MDGNNs) with edge-graph information bottleneck (EGIB) to design a robust framework for signal processing. Specifically, MDGNNs utilize hyper-edges instead of vertices to update representations to avoid indistinguishable features and reduce information loss, while EGIB encourages providing minimal sufficient information about outputs to avoid aggregation of irrelevant information. We numerically demonstrate that compared with existing frameworks, the proposed frameworks achieve excellent performance in terms of spectrum efficiency (SE) and network overhead under multiple signal processing tasks. Remarkably, as the interference noise increases, the SE performance of the proposed frameworks gradually stabilizes. This reveals the proposed frameworks have excellent robustness in interference prone environments, especially in wireless policies related to channel matrices.",2025-02-15T17:56:30Z,2025-02-15T17:56:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10869v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10869v1,eess.SP
Model-Based Learning for DOA Estimation with One-Bit Single-Snapshot   Sparse Arrays,"Yunqiao Hu, Shunqiao Sun, Yimin D. Zhang","We address the challenging problem of estimating the directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple off-grid signals using a single snapshot of one-bit quantized measurements. Conventional DOA estimation methods face difficulties in tackling this problem effectively. This paper introduces a domain-knowledge-guided learning framework to achieve high-resolution DOA estimation in such a scenario, thus drastically reducing hardware complexity without compromising performance. We first reformulate DOA estimation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, unifying on-grid and off-grid scenarios under a Laplacian-type sparsity prior to effectively enforce sparsity for both uniform and sparse linear arrays. For off-grid signals, a first-order approximation grid model is embedded into the one-bit signal model. We then reinterpret one-bit sensing as a binary classification task, employing a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic link function to enhance stability and estimation accuracy. To resolve the non-convexity inherent in the MAP formulation, we develop augmented algorithmic frameworks based on majorization-minimization principles. Further, we design model-based inference neural networks by deep unrolling these frameworks, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving the estimation precision. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework across a wide range of input signal-to-noise ratio values and off-grid deviations. By integrating the unified model-based priors with data-driven learning, this work bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility in one-bit single-snapshot DOA estimation, offering a scalable, hardware-efficient solution for next-generation radar and communication systems.",2025-02-15T16:24:10Z,2025-02-15T16:24:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17473v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17473v1,eess.SP

Rawsamble: Overlapping and Assembling Raw Nanopore Signals using a   Hash-based Seeding Mechanism,"Can Firtina, Maximilian Mordig, Harun Mustafa, Sayan Goswami, Nika Mansouri Ghiasi, Stefano Mercogliano, Furkan Eris, Jo√´l Lindegger, Andre Kahles, Onur Mutlu","Raw nanopore signal analysis is a common approach in genomics to provide fast and resource-efficient analysis without translating the signals to bases (i.e., without basecalling). However, existing solutions cannot interpret raw signals directly if a reference genome is unknown due to a lack of accurate mechanisms to handle increased noise in pairwise raw signal comparison. Our goal is to enable the direct analysis of raw signals without a reference genome. To this end, we propose Rawsamble, the first mechanism that can 1) identify regions of similarity between all raw signal pairs, known as all-vs-all overlapping, using a hash-based search mechanism and 2) use these to construct genomes from scratch, called de novo assembly.   Our extensive evaluations across multiple genomes of varying sizes show that Rawsamble provides a significant speedup (on average by 16.36x and up to 41.59x) and reduces peak memory usage (on average by 11.73x and up to by 41.99x) compared to a conventional genome assembly pipeline using the state-of-the-art tools for basecalling (Dorado's fastest mode) and overlapping (minimap2) on a CPU. We find that 36.57% of overlapping pairs generated by Rawsamble are identical to those generated by minimap2. Using the overlaps from Rawsamble, we construct the first de novo assemblies directly from raw signals without basecalling. We show that we can construct contiguous assembly segments (unitigs) up to 2.7 million bases in length (half the genome length of E. coli). We identify previously unexplored directions that can be enabled by finding overlaps and constructing de novo assemblies. Rawsamble is available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash.

Coarse-Grained Model of Entropic Allostery,"Rhoda J. Hawkins, Thomas C. B.

An alternative entropic mechanism of ``allostery'' suggests that the inducer ligand changes the intramolecular vibrational entropy not just the static structure. We present a quantitative, coarse-grained model of entropic allostery that suggests design rules for internal cohesive potentials in proteins employing this effect. It also addresses the issue of how the signal information to bind or unbind is transmitted through the protein.

Dynamic receptor team formation can explain the high signal transduction   gain in E. coli,"Reka Albert, Yu-wen Chiu, Hans G.

The response frequently involves alteration in the pattern of movement, such as the chemokinesis of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which swims by rotating its flagella. When rotated counterclockwise (CCW) the flagella coalesce into a propulsive bundle, producing a relatively straight ``run'', and when rotated clockwise (CW) they fly apart, resulting in a ``tumble'' which reorients the cell with little translocation. A stochastic process generates the runs and tumbles, and in a chemoeffector gradient runs that carry the cell in a favorable direction are extended.

"Topological basis of signal integration in the   transcriptional-regulatory network of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Illes J. Farkas, Chuang Wu, Chakra Chennubhotla, Ivet Bahar, Zoltan N.

Signal recognition and information processing is a fundamental cellular function, which in part involves comprehensive transcriptional regulatory (TR) mechanisms carried out in response to complex environmental signals in the context of the cell's own internal state. However, the network topological basis of developing such integrated responses remains poorly understood.   RESULTS. By studying the TR network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we show that an intermediate layer of transcription factors naturally segregates into distinct subnetworks. In these topological units transcription factors are densely interlinked in a largely hierarchical manner and respond to external signals by utilizing a fraction of these subnets.   CONCLUSIONS. As transcriptional regulation represents the ""slow"" component of overall information processing, the identified topology suggests a model in which successive waves of transcriptional regulation originating from distinct fractions of the TR network control robust integrated responses to complex stimuli.",2006-10-30T09:19:53Z,2006-10-30T09:19:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0610055v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0610055v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.GN"
Enzyme localization can drastically affect signal amplification in   signal transduction pathways,"Siebe B. van Albada, Pieter Rein ten Wolde","Push-pull networks are ubiquitous in signal transduction pathways in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. They allow cells to strongly amplify signals via the mechanism of zero-order ultrasensitivity. In a push-pull network, two antagonistic enzymes control the activity of a protein by covalent modification. These enzymes are often uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. They can, however, also be colocalized in space, for instance, near the pole of the cell. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that these enzymes can also be spatially separated, leading to gradients of the active form of the messenger protein. Here, we investigate the consequences of the spatial distributions of the enzymes for the amplification properties of push-pull networks. Our calculations reveal that enzyme localization by itself can have a dramatic effect on the gain. The gain is maximized when the two enzymes are either uniformly distributed or colocalized in one region in the cell. Depending on the diffusion constants, however, the sharpness of the response can be strongly reduced when the enzymes are spatially separated. We discuss how our predictions could be tested experimentally.",2007-08-27T14:40:17Z,2007-08-27T14:40:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3599v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.3599v1,q-bio.MN
A mechanistic model for +1 frameshifts in eubacteria,"Lalit Ponnala, Donald Bitzer, Anne Stomp, Mladen Vouk",This work applies the methods of signal processing and the concepts of control system design to model the maintenance and modulation of reading frame in the process of protein synthesis. The model shows how translational speed can modulate translational accuracy to accomplish programmed +1 frameshifts and could have implications for the regulation of translational efficiency. A series of free energy estimates were calculated from the ribosome's interaction with mRNA sequences during the process of translation elongation in eubacteria. A sinusoidal pattern of roughly constant phase was detected in these free energy signals. Signal phase was identified as a useful parameter for locating programmed +1 frameshifts encoded in bacterial genes for release factor 2. A displacement model was developed that captures the mechanism of frameshift based on the information content of the signal parameters and the relative abundance of tRNA in the bacterial cell. Results are presented using experimentally verified frameshift genes across eubacteria.,2007-12-13T01:02:37Z,2007-12-13T01:02:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2068v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.2068v1,q-bio.GN
The Goldbeter-Koshland switch in the first-order region and its response   to dynamic disorder,"Jianhua Xing, Jing Chen","In their classical work (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1981, 78:6840-6844), Goldbeter and Koshland mathematically analyzed a reversible covalent modification system which is highly sensitive to the concentration of effectors. Its signal-response curve appears sigmoidal, constituting a biochemical switch. However, the switch behavior only emerges in the ""zero-order region"", i.e. when the signal molecule concentration is much lower than that of the substrate it modifies. In this work we showed that the switching behavior can also occur under comparable concentrations of signals and substrates, provided that the signal molecules catalyze the modification reaction in cooperation. We also studied the effect of dynamic disorders on the proposed biochemical switch, in which the enzymatic reaction rates, instead of constant, appear as stochastic functions of time. We showed that the system is robust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder is quasi-static, large fluctuations of the switch response behavior may be observed at low concentrations. Such fluctuation is relevant to many biological functions. It can be reduced by either increasing the conformation interconversion rate of the protein, or correlating the enzymatic reaction rates in the network.",2008-04-15T18:24:15Z,2008-04-15T18:24:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2449v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.2449v1,q-bio.MN
Simulating Tissue Morphogenesis and Signaling,"Dagmar Iber, Simon Tanaka, Patrick Fried, Philipp Germann, Denis Menshykau","During embryonic development tissue morphogenesis and signaling are tightly coupled. It is therefore important to simulate both tissue morphogenesis and signaling simultaneously in in silico models of developmental processes. The resolution of the processes depends on the questions of interest. As part of this chapter we will introduce different descriptions of tissue morphogenesis. In the most simple approximation tissue is a continuous domain and tissue expansion is described according to a pre-defined function of time (and possibly space). In a slightly more advanced version the expansion speed and direction of the tissue may depend on a signaling variable that evolves on the domain. Both versions will be referred to as 'prescribed growth'. Alternatively tissue can be regarded as incompressible fluid and can be described with Navier-Stokes equations. Local cell expansion, proliferation, and death are then incorporated by a source term. In other applications the cell boundaries may be important and cell-based models must be introduced. Finally, cells may move within the tissue, a process best described by agent-based models.",2013-05-25T13:56:37Z,2013-05-25T13:56:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5922v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5922v1,"q-bio.TO, q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM"

Nonetheless, the continuous increase in computational power and the development of new data processing algorithms in the recent years have put into reach the possibility of analysing raw EEG signals. Bearing that motivation, the authors propose a new approach using raw data EEG signals and deep learning neural networks, for the classification of motor activities (executed and imagery). The hypothesis to be presented here is: each instantaneous measurement of the raw signal of all EEG channels (superchord) is unique per motor activity regardless the moment of measurement.

Recently, the blockade of negative regulatory molecules (i.e. immune checkpoint signals) demonstrates therapeutic effects in treatment of human cancer, but only in a fraction of cancer patients. Since this therapy is aimed to enhance T cell responses to cancers, here we devised a conceptual model by integrating both positive and negative signals in addition to antigen stimulation. A digital range of adjustment of each signal is formulated in our model for prediction of a final T cell response. This model allows us to evaluate strategies in order to enhance antitumor T cell responses. Our model provides a rational combination strategy for maximizing the therapeutic effects of cancer immunotherapy.",2015-10-28T16:36:04Z,2017-09-16T16:10:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08372v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08372v3,q-bio.CB
Spatial Dispersal of Bacterial Colonies Induces a Dynamical Transition   From Local to Global Quorum Sensing,"Tahir I. Yusufaly, James Q. Boedicker","Bacteria communicate using external chemical signals called autoinducers (AI) in a process known as quorum sensing (QS). QS efficiency is reduced by both limitations of AI diffusion and potential interference from neighboring strains. There is thus a need for predictive theories of how spatial community structure shapes information processing in complex microbial ecosystems. As a step in this direction, we apply a reaction-diffusion model to study autoinducer signaling dynamics in a single-species community as a function of the spatial distribution of colonies in the system. We predict a dynamical transition between a local quorum sensing (LQS) regime, with the AI signaling dynamics primarily controlled by the local population densities of individual colonies, and a global quorum sensing (GQS) regime, with the dynamics being dependent on collective inter-colony diffusive interactions. The crossover between LQS to GQS is intimately connected to a tradeoff between the signaling network's latency, or speed of activation, and its throughput, or the total spatial range over which all the components of the system communicate.",2016-03-22T21:18:24Z,2016-12-02T20:34:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06986v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06986v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.CB"
Electrostatic Forces Mediate Fast Association of Calmodulin and the   Intrinsically Disordered Regulatory Domain of Calcineurin,"Erik C. Cook, Bin Sun, Peter M. Kekenes-Huskey, Trevor P Creamer","Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) govern a daunting number of physiological processes. For such proteins, molecular mechanisms governing their interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways remain unclear. Using the folded, calcium-loaded calmodulin (CaM) interaction with the calcineurin regulatory IDP as a prototype for IDP-mediated signal transduction events, we uncover the interplay of IDP structure and electrostatic interactions in determining the kinetics of protein-protein association. Using an array of biophysical approaches including stopped-flow and computational simulation, we quantify the relative contributions of electrostatic interactions and conformational ensemble characteristics in determining association kinetics of calmodulin (CaM) and the calcineurin regulatory domain (CaN RD). Our chief findings are that CaM/CN RD association rates are strongly dependent on ionic strength and that observed rates are largely determined by the electrostatically-driven interaction strength between CaM and the narrow CaN RD calmodulin recognition domain. These studies highlight a molecular mechanism of controlling signal transduction kinetics that may be utilized in wide-ranging signaling cascades that involve IDPs.",2016-11-13T04:22:42Z,2016-11-13T04:22:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04080v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04080v1,q-bio.BM
Functional Alignment with Anatomical Networks is Associated with   Cognitive Flexibility,"John D. Medaglia, Weiyu Huang, Elisabeth A. Karuza, Sharon L. Thompson-Schill, Alejandro Ribeiro, Danielle S. Bassett","Cognitive flexibility describes the human ability to switch between modes of mental function to achieve goals. Mental switching is accompanied by transient changes in brain activity, which must occur atop an anatomical architecture that bridges disparate cortical and subcortical regions by underlying white matter tracts. However, an integrated perspective regarding how white matter networks might constrain brain dynamics during cognitive processes requiring flexibility has remained elusive. To address this challenge, we applied emerging tools from graph signal processing to decompose BOLD signals based on diffusion imaging tractography in 28 individuals performing a perceptual task that probed cognitive flexibility. We found that the alignment between functional signals and the architecture of the underlying white matter network was associated with greater cognitive flexibility across subjects. Signals with behaviorally-relevant alignment were concentrated in the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with cortico-striatal mechanisms of cognitive flexibility. Importantly, these findings are not accessible to unimodal analyses of functional or anatomical neuroimaging alone. Instead, by taking a generalizable and concise reduction of multimodal neuroimaging data, we uncover an integrated structure-function driver of human behavior.",2016-11-26T22:24:29Z,2016-11-26T22:24:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08751v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08751v1,q-bio.NC
Understanding the Impacts of Dark Pools on Price Discovery,Linlin Ye,"This paper investigates the impact of dark pools on price discovery (the efficiency of prices on stock exchanges to aggregate information). Assets are traded in either an exchange or a dark pool, with the dark pool offering better prices but lower execution rates. Informed traders receive noisy and heterogeneous signals about an asset's fundamental. We find that informed traders use dark pools to mitigate their information risk and there is a sorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges, traders with moderate signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak signals do not trade. As a result, dark pools have an amplification effect on price discovery. That is, when information precision is high (information risk is low), the majority of informed traders trade in the exchange hence adding a dark pool enhances price discovery, whereas when information precision is low (information risk is high), the majority of the informed traders trade in the dark pool hence adding a dark pool impairs price discovery. The paper reconciles the conflicting empirical evidence and produces novel empirical predictions. The paper also provides regulatory suggestions with dark pools on current equity markets and in emerging markets.",2016-12-27T03:26:29Z,2016-12-27T03:26:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08486v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08486v1,"q-fin.GN, q-fin.TR"
Seeds Cleansing CNMF for Spatiotemporal Neural Signals Extraction of   Miniscope Imaging Data,"Jinghao Lu, Chunyuan Li, Fan Wang","Miniscope calcium imaging is increasingly being used to monitor large populations of neuronal activities in freely behaving animals.

Here we describe a highly accurate framework for automatically identifying activated neurons and extracting calcium signals from the miniscope imaging data, seeds cleansing Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (sc-CNMF). This sc-CNMF extends the conventional CNMF with two new modules: i) a neural enhancing module to overcome miniscope-specific limitations, and ii) a seeds cleansing module combining LSTM to rigorously select and cleanse the set of seeds for detecting regions-of-interest.

The algorithm utilizes the characteristics of energy centralization of chirp signals in the FRFT domain, together with the time and phase shift properties of the FRFT. Chirp signals are used to construct a training sequence (TS), and fractional cross-correlation is employed to define a detection metric for the TS, from which a set of equations can be obtained. Estimates of both the timing offset and carrier frequency offset (CFO) are obtained by solving these equations. This TS is later employed in a phase-dependent decision-directed least-mean square algorithm for adaptive equalization.

Emergence of collective oscillations in adaptive cells,"Shou-Wen Wang, Lei-Han Tang","Collective oscillation of cells in a population has been reported under diverse biological contexts and with vastly different molecular constructs. Could there be common principles similar to those that govern spontaneous oscillation in mechanical or electrical systems? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative by categorising the response of individual cells against a time-varying signal. A positive intracellular signal relay of sufficient gain from participating cells is required to sustain the oscillations, together with phase matching. The two conditions yield quantitative predictions for the onset cell density and frequency in terms of measured single-cell and signal response functions. Through mathematical constructions, we show that cells that adapt to a constant stimulus fulfil the phase requirement by developing a leading phase in an ""active"" frequency window that enables cell-to-signal energy flow. Analysis of dynamical quorum sensing in several cellular systems with increasing biological complexity reaffirms the pivotal role of adaptation in powering oscillations in an otherwise dissipative cell-to-cell communication channel.

Effective high compression of ECG signals at low level distortion,Laura Rebollo-Neira,"An effective method for compression of ECG signals, which falls within the transform lossy compression category, is proposed. The transformation is realized by a fast wavelet transform. The effectiveness of the approach, in relation to the simplicity and speed of its implementation, is a consequence of the efficient storage of the outputs of the algorithm which is realized in compressed Hierarchical Data Format. The compression performance is tested on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database producing compression results which largely improve upon recently reported benchmarks on the same database. For a distortion corresponding to a percentage root-mean-square difference PRD of 0.53, in mean value, the achieved average compression ratio is 23.17 with quality score of 43.93. For a mean value of PRD up to 1.71 the compression ratio increases up to 62.5. The compression of a 30 min record is realized in an average time of 0.14 s.

Sampling Free TDOA Localization in Millimeter Wave Networks,"Shree Prasad M., Trilochan Panigrahi, Mahbub Hassan, Ming Ding","Time difference of arrival (TDOA) is a widely used technique for localizing a radio transmitter from the difference in signal arrival times at multiple receivers. For TDOA to work, the individual receivers must estimate the respective signal arrival times precisely, which requires sampling the signal at least double the rate of its highest frequency content, commonly known as the Nyquist rate. Such sampling is less practical for the millimeter wave band comprising of frequencies in 30-300 GHz range. In this paper, we propose an energy detection architecture for accurately estimating the time of arrival from a single picosecond Gaussian pulse, which enables TDOA localization without sampling at the receiver. We derive the closed form expression of the estimated time of arrival and validate it via simulation. We demonstrate that the proposed sampling-free TDOA can localize millimeter wave transmitters as accurately as the conventional sampling-based TDOA.",2019-02-05T12:13:26Z,2019-02-05T12:13:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01655v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01655v1,eess.SP
Generalized Design of Sampling Kernels for 2-D FRI Signals,"Saurav Kumaraswami Shastri, Sunil Rudresh, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula","One of the interesting problems in the finite-rate-of-innovation signal sampling framework is the design of compactly supported sampling kernels.

The design is carried out in the frequency domain, where a set of alias cancellation conditions are imposed on the kernel's frequency response. The Paley-Wiener theorem for 2-D signals is invoked to arrive at admissible kernels with a compact support. As a specific case, we show that a certain separable extension of the 1-D design framework results in 2-D sum-of-modulated-spline (SMS) kernels. Similar to their 1-D counterparts, the 2-D SMS kernels have the attractive feature of reproducing a class of 2-D polynomial-modulated exponentials of a desired order. Also, the support of the kernels is independent of the order. The design framework is generic and also allows one to design nonseparable sampling kernels.

We recently reported the existence of electrical signalling in a much simpler organism, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In dense bacterial communities known as biofilms, nutrient-deprived B. subtilis cells in the interior of the colony use electrical communication to transmit stress signals to the periphery, which interfere with the growth of peripheral cells and reduce nutrient consumption, thereby relieving stress from the interior. Here we explicitly address the interplay between metabolism and electrophysiology in bacterial biofilms, by introducing a spatially-extended mathematical model that combines the metabolic and electrical components of the phenomenon in a discretised reaction-diffusion scheme. The model is experimentally validated by environmental and genetic perturbations, and confirms that metabolic stress is transmitted through the bacterial population via a potassium wave. Interestingly, this behaviour is reminiscent of cortical spreading depression in the brain, characterised by a wave of electrical activity mediated by potassium diffusion that has been linked to various neurological disorders, calling for future studies on the evolutionary link between the two phenomena.",2019-02-17T23:47:34Z,2019-02-17T23:47:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06352v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06352v1,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.CB"

However, in frequency selective channels, these features are severely distorted resulting in a poor classification performance. We propose to use constant modulus algorithm (CMA) to mitigate the impact of the frequency selective channel on the signal feature. Simulation and analytical results show that the proposed CMA-rcK technique outperforms state-of-the-art cumulant-based technique as well as blind equalizer-based technique that uses Alphabet Matched Algorithm.",2019-03-18T18:32:11Z,2019-03-18T18:32:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07657v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07657v1,eess.SP
Design of robust radar detectors through random perturbation of the   target signature,"Angelo Coluccia, Giuseppe Ricci, Olivier Besson","The paper addresses the problem of designing radar detectors more robust than Kelly's detector to possible mismatches of the assumed target signature, but with no performance degradation under matched conditions. The idea is to model the received signal under the signal-plus-noise hypothesis by adding a random component, parameterized via a design covariance matrix, that makes the hypothesis more plausible in presence of mismatches. Moreover, an unknown power of such component, to be estimated from the observables, can lead to no performance loss. Derivation of the (one-step) GLRT is provided for two choices of the design matrix, obtaining detectors with different complexity and behavior. A third parametric detector is also obtained by an ad-hoc generalization of one of such GLRTs. The analysis shows that the proposed approach can cover a range of different robustness levels that is not achievable by state-of-the-art with the same performance of Kelly's detector under matched conditions.",2019-03-20T12:16:48Z,2019-10-01T09:08:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08468v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08468v2,eess.SP
A novel approach to robust radar detection of range-spread targets,"Angelo Coluccia, Alessio Fascista, Giuseppe Ricci","This paper proposes a novel approach to robust radar detection of range-spread targets embedded in Gaussian noise with unknown covariance matrix.

Moreover, an unknown power of the random components, to be estimated from the observables, is inserted to optimize the performance when the mismatch is absent. The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for the problem at hand is considered. In addition, a new parametric detector that encompasses the GLRT as a special case is also introduced and assessed.

Vegetation High-Impedance Faults' High-Frequency Signatures via Sparse   Coding,"Douglas P. S. Gomes, Cagil Ozansoy, Anwaar Ulhaq","The behavior of High-Impedance Faults (HIFs) in power distribution systems depends on multiple factors, making it a challenging disturbance to model. If enough data from real staged faults is provided, signal processing techniques can help reveal patterns from a specific type of fault. Such a task is implemented herein by employing the Shift-Invariant Sparse Coding (SISC) technique on a data set of staged vegetation high-impedance faults. The technique facilitates the uncoupling of shifted and convoluted patterns present in the recorded signals from fault tests. The deconvolution of these patterns was then individually studied to identify the possible repeating fault signatures. The work is primarily focused on the investigation of the under-discussed high-frequency faults signals, especially regarding voltage disturbances created by the fault currents. Therefore, the main contribution from this paper is the resulted evidence of consistent behavior from real vegetation HIFs at higher frequencies.

However, radio-based positioning suffers from multipath signals generated by different types of objects in the physical environment. Multipath can be turned into a benefit, by building up a radio map (comprising the number of objects, object type, and object state) and using this map to exploit all available signal paths for positioning.

A standard sleep stage determination requires Electroencephalography (EEG) signals during the expensive and labor-intensive Polysomnography (PSG) test. To overcome this inconvenience, cardiorespiratory signals are proposed for the same purpose because of the easy and comfortable acquisition by simplified devices. In this paper, we leverage our low-cost wearable multi-sensor system to acquire the cardiorespiratory signals from subjects. Three novel features are designed during the feature extraction.

Impact of 3D UWB Antenna Radiation Pattern on Air-to-Ground Drone   Connectivity,"Jianlin Chen, Devin Raye, Wahab Khawaja, Priyanka Sinha, Ismail Guvenc","Three dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of an antenna mounted at a drone can significantly influence the air-to-ground (A2G) link quality. Even when a drone transmitter is very close to a ground receiver, if the antenna orientations are not aligned properly, a significant degradation can be observed in the received signal power at the receiver. To characterize such effects for a doughnut-shaped antenna radiation pattern, using an ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter at the drone and a UWB receiver at the ground, we carry out A2G channel measurements to capture the link quality at the ground receiver for various link distances, drone heights, and antenna orientations. We develop a simple analytical model to approximate the influence of 3D antenna patterns on the received signal strength (RSS), which show reasonable agreement with measurements despite the simplicity of the model and the complicated 3D radiation from the UWB antennas. We also explore how the signal strength can be improved when multiple antennas with different orientations are utilized at transmitter/receiver.",2018-10-02T18:22:38Z,2018-12-17T03:51:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01442v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01442v2,eess.SP
High-performance Power Allocation Strategies for Secure Spatial   Modulation,"Feng Shu, Xiaoyu Liu, Guiyang Xia, Tingzhen Xu, Jun Li, Jiangzhou Wang","Optimal power allocation (PA) strategies can make a significant rate improvement in secure spatial modulation (SM). Due to the lack of secrecy rate (SR) closed-form expression in secure SM networks, it is hard to optimize the PA factor. In this paper, two PA strategies are proposed: gradient descent, and maximum product of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and artificial-noise-to-signal-plus-noise ratio (ANSNR)(Max-P-SINR-ANSNR). The former is an iterative method and the latter is a closed-form solution. Compared to the former, the latter is of low-complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed two PA methods can approximately achieve the same SR performance as exhaustive search method and perform far better than three fixed PA ones.

In this work, we perform arrhythmia detection with an optimized neural network having piecewise linear approximation based activation function to alleviate the complex computations in the traditional activation functions. Further, we propose a self-learning method for arrhythmia detection by learning and analyzing the characteristics (period) of the ECG signal.

Omnidirectional Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coded Massive MIMO   Systems,"Can Liu, Xiang-Gen Xia, Yongzhao Li, Xiqi Gao, Hailin Zhang","Common signals in public channels of cellular systems are usually transmitted omnidirectionally from the base station (BS). In recent years, both discrete and consecutive omnidirectional space-time block codings (STBC) have been proposed for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a uniform linear array (ULA) configuration to ensure cell-wide coverage. In these systems, constant received signal power at discrete angles, or constant received signal sum power in a few consecutive time slots at any angle is achieved. In addition, equal-power transmission per antenna and full spatial diversity can be achieved as well. In this letter, by utilizing the property of orthogonal complementary codes (OCCs), a new consecutive omnidirectional quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) design is proposed, in which constant received sum power at any angle can be realized with equal-power transmission per antenna through one STBC transmission, and a higher diversity order of 4 can be achieved.

Tracking Sparse mmWave Channel under Time Varying Multipath Scatterers,"Veljko Boljanovic, Han Yan, Danijela Cabric","Due to severe signal attenuation at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies large antenna arrays are required at both base station and user equipment to achieve necessary beamfoming gain and compensate for the signal power loss. The initial access and beamforming algorithms are typically designed assuming sparsity of mmWave channels, resulting from a very few significant multipath clusters, and considering fixed locations of terminals and scatterers. Channel tracking algorithms have been proposed to account for channel variations due to user mobility. Existing works did not consider mobility of the scatterers, which adds new challenges and opportunities into a channel tracking problem. In this work, we consider a more realistic assumption of mobile scatterers and their impact on channel tracking algorithms. We propose a novel channel tracking algorithm that takes into account the dynamics of cluster evolution, and adaptively tracks channel parameters with the objective to reduce training overhead. We also propose a simple implementation of aperiodic tracking to accommodate tracking to different channel variations. We analyze the performance of the proposed tracking algorithm under highly dynamic channels, and compare it to existing channel tracking algorithms with respect to tracking accuracy, achievable rate, and required training overhead, when aperiodic and periodic trackings are used.",2018-12-03T22:45:37Z,2018-12-03T22:45:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01116v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01116v1,eess.SP

In contrast to current state-of-the art solutions that assume a dedicated DPD per power amplifier, which is unfeasible in the context of large antenna arrays, the proposed solution only requires a single DPD in order to linearize an arbitrary number of power amplifiers. To this end, the proposed DPD predistorts the signal at the input of the digital precoder based on minimizing the nonlinear distortion of the combined signal at the intended receiver direction. This is a desirable feature, since the resulting emissions in other directions get partially diluted due to less coherent superposition. With this approach, only a single DPD is required, yielding great complexity and energy savings.",2018-12-04T08:36:38Z,2018-12-04T08:36:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01274v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01274v1,eess.SP
Covert Transmission with Antenna Selection and Using an External Jammer,"Morteza Sarkheil, Paeiz Azmi, Moslem Forouzesh, Ali Kuhestani","This paper adopts the antenna selection technique to enhance the covert rate in a wireless communication network comprised of a source, a destination , an external jammer and an eavesdropper. In the covert communication, the level of transmit power is low and hence a source with multiple antennas can be adopted to send the information toward the single antenna destination while concurrently, the jammer transmits an artificial noise signal. For this system model, we consider a scenario where the source is forced to select one or several of its antennas to transmit its confidential information due to its limited RF chains. Furthermore, we consider two different jamming scenarios to support our covert communication: 1) The destination is unable to cancel the jamming signal, 2) The destination can subtract the jamming signal. For such a communication network, our aim is to maximize the covert rate subject to power constraint and covert communication requirement. In the first scenario, the optimization problem is non-convex, and hence, it can be solved through using Difference of Convex function (DC) method while the optimization problem of the second scenario is intrinsically convex. Our numerical results show that the higher the number of selected antennas at the transmitter, the higher the covert rate will be achieved.",2018-12-26T13:43:51Z,2018-12-26T13:43:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10312v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10312v1,eess.SP
A Block Alternating Optimization Method for Direction-of-Arrival   Estimation with Nested Array,"Yunmei Shi, Xing-Peng Mao, Chunlei Zhao, Yong-Tan Liu","In this paper, direction-of-arrival estimation using nested array is studied in the framework of sparse signal representation. With the vectorization operator, a new real-valued nonnegative sparse signal recovery model which has a wider virtual array aperture is built. To leverage celebrated compressive sensing algorithms, the continuous parameter space has to be discretized to a number of fixed grid points, which inevitably incurs modeling error caused by off-grid gap. To remedy this issue, a block alternating optimization method is put forth that jointly estimates the sparse signal and refines the locations of grid points. Specifically, inspired by the majorization minimization, the proposed method iteratively minimizes a surrogate function majorizing the given objective function, where only a single block of variables are updated per iteration while the remaining ones are kept fixed.

The proposed deep channel estimator can outperform LS estimation with nearly the same complexity, and approach MMSE estimation performance to within 1 dB without knowing the second order statistics. The only complexity increase with respect to LS estimator lies in fitting the parameters of a deep neural network (DNN) periodically on the order of the channel coherence time. We empirically show that the main benefit of this method accrues from the ability of this specially designed DNN to exploit correlations in the time-frequency grid. The proposed estimator can also reduce the number of pilot tones needed in an OFDM time-frequency grid, e.g. in an LTE scenario by 98% (68%) when the channel coherence time interval is 73ms (4.5ms).",2019-04-19T21:18:04Z,2019-04-19T21:18:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09346v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09346v1,eess.SP

The indoor environment with background obstacles (furniture) appears as a set of patterns in the time domain when the transmitted optical signals are reflected from objects in LiDAL systems.

Improved Blind Channel Estimation Performance by Nearby Channel   Estimation,"Jia-Chyi Wu, Zhen-Wei Kao","To obtain channel information for further data transmission, the blind channel estimation needs no pilot signal in advance is a considerable algorithm. To improve performance of the blind channel estimation schemes, we have employed the channel estimation with pilot signals by adjacent users; the acquired estimation channel information of the adjacent channel is applied as an initial state to the blind channel estimation of the target user. We have considered the subspace blind channel estimation scheme in this study. The estimated adjacent channel information is supported as an initial state of the auto-correlation matrix in the subspace estimation method, thereby providing information to reduce the channel estimation error. From our simulation study, we have found that, when the correlation between two nearby channels is high, the forgetting factor in the subspace estimation method can be increased, so that the weight of the initial state of the matrix is increased, and a more accurate channel state is estimated. If the correlation coefficient is lowered in two adjacent channels, the forgetting factor can be appropriately adjusted to rise the weight of the direct received signal from the objective channel to avoid errors increased.",2019-10-31T03:29:59Z,2019-10-31T03:29:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14236v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14236v1,eess.SP

Neural network interpretation using descrambler groups,"Jake L. Amey, Jake Keeley, Tajwar Choudhury, Ilya Kuprov","The lack of interpretability and trust is a much-criticised feature of deep neural networks. In fully connected nets, the signalling between inner layers is scrambled because backpropagation training does not require perceptrons to be arranged in any particular order. The result is a black box; this problem is particularly severe in scientific computing and digital signal processing (DSP), where neutral nets perform abstract mathematical transformations that do not reduce to features or concepts.   We present here a group-theoretical procedure that attempts to bring inner layer signalling into a human-readable form, the assumption being that this form exists and has identifiable and quantifiable features - for example, smoothness or locality. We applied the proposed method to DEERNet (a DSP network used in electron spin resonance) and managed to descramble it. We found considerable internal sophistication: the network spontaneously invents a bandpass filter, a notch filter, a frequency axis rectifier, frequency division multiplexing, group embedding, spectral filtering regularisation, and a Fourier-like transform that maps harmonic functions into Chebyshev polynomials - in ten minutes of unattended training from a random initial guess.",2019-12-02T13:32:44Z,2020-08-10T08:28:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01498v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01498v3,eess.SP
Spectrum Prediction and Interference Detection for Satellite   Communications,"Lissy Pellaco, Nirankar Singh, Joakim Jald√©n","Spectrum monitoring and interference detection are crucial for the satellite service performance and the revenue of SatCom operators. Interference is one of the major causes of service degradation and deficient operational efficiency. Moreover, the satellite spectrum is becoming more crowded, as more satellites are being launched for different applications. This increases the risk of interference, which causes anomalies in the received signal, and mandates the adoption of techniques that can enable the automatic and real-time detection of such anomalies as a first step towards interference mitigation and suppression. In this paper, we present a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach able to guarantee a real-time and automatic detection of both short-term and long-term interference in the spectrum of the received signal at the base station. The proposed approach can localize the interference both in time and in frequency and is universally applicable across a discrete set of different signal spectra. We present experimental results obtained by applying our method to real spectrum data from the Swedish Space Corporation. We also compare our ML-based approach to a model-based approach applied to the same spectrum data and used as a realistic baseline. Experimental results show that our method is a more reliable interference detector.",2019-12-10T14:42:22Z,2019-12-10T14:42:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04716v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04716v1,eess.SP
Food Waste Estimation Using Received Signal Strength Indicator,"Daniel Koohmarey, Nitish Nagesh","Food loss and waste is a problem with rising global recognition. Attempts to combat food waste at institutional levels such as college campus dining halls require insight into food waste statistics to evaluate efforts to reduce food waste. Gathering such data is currently costly, requiring manual sorting and weighing of trash bin contents. We propose an alternate method of estimating the food waste in trash bins using a radio frequency (RF) transceiver received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to estimate the attenuation caused by the trash contents. We propose food attenuates the radio frequency signal at greater rates than the paper and plastic trash present, allowing us to correlate and estimate the amount (weight) of food waste present with the observed RSSI values. We witness promising results while testing this approach.",2019-12-20T19:33:11Z,2019-12-20T19:33:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10072v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10072v1,eess.SP
Signal Acquisition with Photon-Counting Detector Arrays in Free-Space   Optical Communications,"Muhammad Salman Bashir, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","Pointing and acquisition are an important aspect of free-space optical communications because of the narrow beamwidth associated with the optical signal. In this paper, we have analyzed the pointing and acquisition problem in free-space optical communications for photon-counting detector arrays and Gaussian beams. In this regard, we have considered the maximum likelihood detection for detecting the location of the array, and analyzed the one-shot probabilities of missed detection and false alarm using the scaled Poisson approximation. Moreover, the upper/lower bounds on the probabilities of missed detection and false alarm for one complete scan are also derived, and these probabilities are compared with Monte Carlo approximations for a few cases. Additionally, the upper bounds on the acquisition time and the mean acquisition time are also derived. The upper bound on mean acquisition time is minimized numerically with respect to the beam radius for a constant signal-to-noise ratio scenario. Finally, the complementary distribution function of an upper bound on acquisition time is also calculated in a closed form. Our study concludes that an array of smaller detectors gives a better acquisition performance (in terms of acquisition time) as compared to one large detector of similar dimensions as the array.",2019-12-23T02:15:09Z,2019-12-23T02:15:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10586v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10586v1,eess.SP

Existing algorithms strongly reduce the computational complexity of the sparse decomposition of signals in discrete factorizable dictionaries. On another flavour, existing greedy algorithms use interpolation strategies from a discretization of continuous dictionaries to perform off-the-grid decomposition. Our algorithm aims to combine the factorization and the interpolation concepts to enable low complexity computation of continuous sparse representation of signals.

Crossterm-Free Time-Frequency Representation Exploiting Deep   Convolutional Neural Network,"Shuimei Zhang, Yimin D. Zhang","Bilinear time-frequency representations (TFRs) provide high-resolution time-varying frequency characteristics of nonstationary signals. However, they suffer from crossterms due to the bilinear nature. Existing crossterm-reduced TFRs focus on optimized kernel design which amounts to low-pass weighting or masking in the ambiguity function domain. Optimization of fixed and adaptive kernels are difficult, particularly for complicated signals whose autoterms and crossterms overlap in the ambiguity function. In this letter, we develop a new method to offer high-resolution TFRs of nonstationary signals with crossterms effectively suppressed. The proposed method exploits a deep convolutional neural network which is trained to construct crossterm-free TFRs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results which clearly show desirable autoterm preservation and crossterm mitigation capabilities. The proposed technique significantly outperforms state-of-the-art time-frequency analysis algorithms based on adaptive kernels and compressive sensing techniques.",2020-07-07T15:46:20Z,2020-07-07T15:46:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03570v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03570v1,eess.SP
Predicting Bit Error Rate from Meta Information using Random Forests,"Jianyuan Yu, Yue Xu, Hussein Metwaly Saad, R.

One such problem of practical interest is choosing a proper interference mitigation method based on the meta information of the received signal. Since heuristic table-based methods suffer from limited prediction capability for unseen cases, we propose a recommendation system based on the use of Random Forests (RF). Specifically, RF used to predict the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of all mitigation approaches so as to determine the approach with the best performance. We found RF can predict BER with high accuracy, and its importance factor demonstrates which input attributes matter most. These BER prediction results can also benefit other functions such as adaptive modulation, channel sensing, beaming selection, etc.",2020-07-10T17:29:22Z,2020-07-10T17:29:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05503v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05503v1,eess.SP
Third-Order Statistics Reconstruction from Compressive Measurements,"Yanbo Wang, Zhi Tian","Estimation of third-order statistics relies on the availability of a huge amount of data records, which can pose severe challenges on the data collecting hardware in terms of considerable storage costs, overwhelming energy consumption, and unaffordably high sampling rate especially when dealing with high-dimensional data such as wideband signals. To overcome these challenges, this paper focuses on the reconstruction of the third-order cumulants under the compressive sensing framework. Specifically, this paper derives a transformed linear system that directly connects the cross-cumulants of compressive measurements to the desired third-order statistics. We provide sufficient conditions for lossless third-order statistics reconstruction via solving simple least-squares, along with the strongest achievable compression ratio. To reduce the computational burden, we also propose an approach to recover diagonal cumulant slices directly from compressive measurements, which is useful when the cumulant slices are sufficient for the inference task at hand. All the proposed techniques are tested via extensive simulations. The developed joint sampling and reconstruction approach to third-order statistics estimation is able to reduce the required sampling rates significantly by exploiting the cumulant structure resulting from signal stationarity, even in the absence of any sparsity constraints on the signal or cumulants.",2020-07-30T03:08:49Z,2021-05-13T12:23:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15202v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15202v2,eess.SP
Absolute quantification of real-time PCR data with stage signal   difference analysis,"Chuanbo Liu, Jin Wang","Real-time PCR, or Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is an effective approach to quantify nucleic acid samples. Given the complicated reaction system along with thermal cycles, there has been long-term confusion on accurately calculating the initial nucleic acid amounts from the fluorescence signals. Although many improved algorithms had been proposed, the classical threshold method is still the primary choice in the routine application. In this study, we will first illustrate the origin of the linear relationship between the threshold value and logarithm of the initial nucleic acid amount by reconstructing the PCR reaction process with stochastic simulations. We then develop a new method for the absolute quantification of nucleic acid samples with qPCR. By monitoring the fluorescence signal changes in every stage of the thermal cycle, we are able to calculate a representation of the step-wise efficiency change. This is the first work calculated PCR efficiency change directly from the fluorescence signal, without fitting or sophisticated analysis. Our results revealed that the efficiency change during the PCR process is complicated and can not be modeled simply by monotone function model. Based on the calculated efficiency, we illustrate a new absolute qPCR analysis method for accurately determining nucleic acid amount.

Hybrid Interference Mitigation Using Analog Prewhitening,"Wei Zhang, Yi Jiang, Bin Zhou, Die Hu","This paper proposes a novel scheme for mitigating strong interferences, which is applicable to various wireless scenarios, including full-duplex wireless communications and uncoordinated heterogenous networks. As strong interferences can saturate the receiver's analog-to-digital converters (ADC), they need to be mitigated both before and after the ADCs, i.e., via hybrid processing. The key idea of the proposed scheme, namely the Hybrid Interference Mitigation using Analog Prewhitening (HIMAP), is to insert an M-input M-output analog phase shifter network (PSN) between the receive antennas and the ADCs to spatially prewhiten the interferences, which requires no signal information but only an estimate of the covariance matrix. After interference mitigation by the PSN prewhitener, the preamble can be synchronized, the signal channel response can be estimated, and thus a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamformer can be applied in the digital domain to further mitigate the residual interferences. The simulation results verify that the HIMAP scheme can suppress interferences 80dB stronger than the signal by using off-the-shelf phase shifters (PS) of 6-bit resolution.",2021-03-04T02:26:08Z,2021-03-04T02:26:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02791v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02791v1,eess.SP
An Adaptive Receiver for Underwater Acoustic Full-Duplex Communication   with Joint Tracking of the Remote and Self-Interference Channels,"Mohammad Towliat, Zheng Guo, Leonard J. Cimini, Xiang-Gen Xia, Aijun Song","Full-duplex (FD) communication is a promising candidate to address the data rate limitations in underwater acoustic (UWA) channels. Because of transmission at the same time and on the same frequency band, the signal from the local transmitter creates self-interference (SI) that contaminates the signal from the remote transmitter. At the local receiver, channel state information for both the SI and remote channels is required to remove the SI and equalize the SI-free signal, respectively. However, because of the rapid time-variations of the UWA environment, real-time tracking of the channels is necessary. In this paper, we propose a receiver for UWA-FD communication in which the variations of the SI and remote channels are jointly tracked by using a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm fed by feedback from the previously detected data symbols. Because of the joint channel estimation, SI cancellation is more successful compared to UWA-FD receivers with separate channel estimators. In addition, due to providing a real-time channel tracking without the need for frequent training sequences, the bandwidth efficiency is preserved in the proposed receiver.",2021-03-11T23:22:46Z,2021-03-11T23:22:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07002v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07002v1,eess.SP

While sophisticated modifications to instrumentation may reduce noise, a simpler approach that can benefit all sensor platforms is the application of signal processing to minimize the deleterious effects of noise. In this work, we show that applying complex Morlet wavelet convolution to Fabry-P\'erot interference fringes characteristic of thin film reflectometric biosensors effectively filters out white noise and low frequency reflectance variations. Subsequent calculation of an average difference in phase between the filtered analyte and reference signals enables a significant reduction in the limit of detection (LOD) enabling closer competition with current state-of-the-art techniques. This method is applied on experimental data sets of thin film porous silicon sensors (PSi) in buffered solution and complex media obtained from two different laboratories.

By defining a graph structure between agents in a swarm, we can treat the agents' properties as a graph signal and use tools from the field of graph signal processing to understand local and global swarm properties.

Continuous-Domain Formulation of Inverse Problems for Composite   Sparse-Plus-Smooth Signals,"Thomas Debarre, Shayan Aziznejad, Michael Unser","We present a novel framework for the reconstruction of 1D composite signals assumed to be a mixture of two additive components, one sparse and the other smooth, given a finite number of linear measurements. We formulate the reconstruction problem as a continuous-domain regularized inverse problem with multiple penalties. We prove that these penalties induce reconstructed signals that indeed take the desired form of the sum of a sparse and a smooth component. We then discretize this problem using Riesz bases, which yields a discrete problem that can be solved by standard algorithms. Our discretization is exact in the sense that we are solving the continuous-domain problem over the search space specified by our bases without any discretization error. We propose a complete algorithmic pipeline and demonstrate its feasibility on simulated data.",2021-03-24T17:54:02Z,2021-03-24T17:54:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13380v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13380v1,eess.SP
Low-dimensional Denoising Embedding Transformer for ECG Classification,"Jian Guan, Wenbo Wang, Pengming Feng, Xinxin Wang, Wenwu Wang","The transformer based model (e.g., FusingTF) has been employed recently for Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification. However, the high-dimensional embedding obtained via 1-D convolution and positional encoding can lead to the loss of the signal's own temporal information and a large amount of training parameters. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG classification, called low-dimensional denoising embedding transformer (LDTF), which contains two components, i.e., low-dimensional denoising embedding (LDE) and transformer learning. In the LDE component, a low-dimensional representation of the signal is obtained in the time-frequency domain while preserving its own temporal information. And with the low dimensional embedding, the transformer learning is then used to obtain a deeper and narrower structure with fewer training parameters than that of the FusingTF. Experiments conducted on the MIT-BIH dataset demonstrates the effectiveness and the superior performance of our proposed method, as compared with state-of-the-art methods.",2021-03-31T14:14:59Z,2021-03-31T14:14:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17099v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.17099v1,eess.SP

A path-signal can be viewed as the trajectory of a moving agent on a graph in several consecutive time points. Combining dynamic programming and graph partitioning, we propose a path-localization algorithm with significantly reduced computational complexity. We analyze the localization error for the proposed approach both in the Hamming distance and the destination's distance between the path estimate and the true path using numerical bounds. Unlike usual theoretical bounds that only apply to restricted graph models, the obtained numerical bounds apply to all graphs and all non-overlapping graph-partitioning schemes. In random geometric graphs, we are able to derive a closed-form expression for the localization error bound, and a tradeoff between localization error and the computational complexity. Finally, we compare the proposed technique with the maximum likelihood estimate under the path constraint in terms of computational complexity and localization error, and show significant speedup (100 times) with comparable localization error (4 times) on a graph from real data. Variants of the proposed technique can be applied to tracking, road congestion monitoring, and brain signal processing.",2017-11-03T20:51:34Z,2017-11-03T20:51:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01329v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01329v1,eess.SP

In particular, the need for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) for many internet of things (IoT) users is greatly emphasized. In this paper, we present a novel spread spectrum waveform design that we propose for transmission of control signals to establish URLLC communications. These control signals are transmitted over the spectral resources that belong to the MBB communications in the network, but at a level that minimally affects these data channels. The proposed waveform, although a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique, is designed to take advantage of symbol synchronization available to the OFDM broad band communications in the network.

The second technique is based on an iterative approach, which finds the filter coefficients by iteratively minimizing the true error (instead of the modified error) between the modeled and the desired frequency response. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and compared with finite impulse response (FIR) graph filters, on both synthetic and real data.

A Novel Matrix Representation of Discrete Biomedical Signals,"Aditya Ramesh, Anagh Pathak, Kaushik Majumdar","In this work we propose a novel symmetric square matrix representation of one or more digital signals of finite equal length. For appropriate window length and sliding paradigm this matrix contains useful information about the signals in a two dimensional image form. Then this representation can be treated either as an algebraic matrix or as a geometric image. We have shown applications of both on human multichannel intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). In the first application we have shown that for certain patients the highest eigenvalue of the matrix obtained from the epileptic focal channels goes up during a seizure. The focus of this paper is on an application of the second concept, by which we have come up with an automatic seizure detection algorithm on a publicly available benchmark data. Except for delay in detection in all other aspects the new algorithm outperformed the detection performance based on a support vector machine based algorithm. We have also indicated how this sparse random matrix representation of brain electrical signals can encode the activities of the brain.",2016-01-13T14:18:33Z,2016-01-13T14:18:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03255v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.03255v1,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.NC"

Exploiting WiFi Channel State Information for Residential Healthcare   Informatics,"Bo Tan, Qingchao Chen, Kevin Chetty, Karl Woodbridge, Wenda Li, Robert Piechocki","Detection and interpretation of human activities have emerged as a challenging healthcare problem in areas such as assisted living and remote monitoring. Besides traditional approaches that rely on wearable devices and camera systems, WiFi based technologies are evolving as a promising solution for indoor monitoring and activity recognition. This is, in part, due to the pervasive nature of WiFi in residential settings such as homes and care facilities, and unobtrusive nature of WiFi based sensing. Advanced signal processing techniques can accurately extract WiFi channel status information (CSI) using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices or bespoke hardware. This includes phase variations, frequency shifts and signal levels. In this paper, we describe the healthcare application of Doppler shifts in the WiFi CSI, caused by human activities which take place in the signal coverage area. The technique is shown to recognize different types of human activities and behaviour and be very suitable for applications in healthcare. Three experimental case studies are presented to illustrate the capabilities of WiFi CSI Doppler sensing in assisted living and residential care environments.

Blind Estimation Algorithms for I/Q Imbalance in Direct Down-conversion   Receivers,"Peiyang Song, Fengkui Gong, Hang Zhang, Guo Li","As known, receivers with in-phase and quadrature phase (I/Q) down conversion, especially direct-conversion architectures, always suffer from I/Q imbalance. I/Q imbalance is caused by amplitude and phase mismatch between I/Q paths. The performance degradation resulting from I/Q imbalance can not be mitigated with simply higher signal to noise ratio (SNR). Thus, I/Q imbalance compensation in the digital domain is critical. There are two main contributions in this paper. Firstly, we proposed a blind estimation algorithm for I/Q imbalance parameters based on joint first and second order statistics (FSS) which has lower complexity than conventional Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation (GMLE). This can be used for further processing such as equalization in the presence of receiver IQ imbalance. In addition, we find out the reason of the error floor in conventional I/Q imbalance compensation method based on the conjugate signal model (CSM). The proposed joint first order statistics and conjugate signal model (FSCSM) compensation algorithm can reach the ideal bit error rate (BER) performance.",2017-12-16T14:57:11Z,2019-04-04T07:35:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05970v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05970v2,eess.SP
A Learnable Distortion Correction Module for Modulation Recognition,"Kumar Yashashwi, Amit Sethi, Prasanna Chaporkar","Modulation recognition is a challenging task while performing spectrum sensing in a cognitive radio setup. Recently, the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for modulation recognition \cite{survey}. However, a wireless channel distorts the signal and CNNs are not explicitly designed to undo these artifacts. To improve the performance of CNN-based recognition schemes we propose a signal distortion correction module (CM) and show that this CM+CNN scheme achieves accuracy better than the existing schemes. The proposed CM is also based on a neural network that estimates the random carrier frequency and phase offset introduced by the channel and feeds it to a part that undoes this distortion right before CNN-based modulation recognition. Its output is differentiable with respect to its weights, which allows it to be trained end-to-end with the modulation recognition CNN based on the received signal. For supervision, only the modulation scheme label is used and the knowledge of true frequency or phase offset is not required.",2018-03-04T08:41:48Z,2018-03-04T08:41:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01319v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01319v1,eess.SP
Spectral Analysis of GFDM Modulated Signal under Nonlinear Behavior of   Power Amplifier,"Amirhossein Mohammadian, Abbas Mohammadi, Abdolali Abdipour, Mina Baghani","General frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is a flexible non-orthogonal waveform candidate for 5G which can offer some advantages such as low out-of-band (OOB) emission and high spectral efficiency. In this paper, the effects of nonlinear behavior of practical PAs on GFDM signal are studied. In the first step, a closed form expression for power spectral density (PSD) of GFDM signal is extracted. Then, the PSD at the output of PA as a function of input power and the coefficients of nonlinear polynomial PA model is derived. In addition, the adjacent channel power (ACP) and ACP ratio, as two important performance metrics, are evaluated. The simulation results confirm the accuracy of derived analytical expressions. Moreover, to validate the performance of GFDM modulation after nonlinear PA, it is compared with OFDM modulation.",2018-03-06T06:02:21Z,2018-03-06T06:02:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02026v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02026v1,eess.SP
A CNN and LSTM-Based Approach to Classifying Transient Radio Frequency   Interference,"Daniel Czech, Amit Mishra, Michael Inggs","Transient radio frequency interference (RFI) is detrimental to radio astronomy. It is particularly difficult to identify the sources of transient RFI, which is broadband and intermittent. Such RFI is often generated by devices like mechanical relays, fluorescent lighting or AC machines, which may be present in the surrounding infrastructure of a radio telescope array. One mitigating approach is to deploy independent RFI monitoring stations at radio telescope arrays. Once the sources of RFI signals are identified, they may be removed or replaced where possible. For the first time in the open literature, we demonstrate an approach to classifying the sources of transient RFI (in time domain data) that makes use of deep learning techniques including CNNs and LSTMs. Applied to a previously obtained dataset of experimentally recorded transient RFI signals, our proposed approach offers good results. It shows potential for development into a tool for identifying the sources of transient RFI signals recorded by independent RFI monitoring stations.",2018-03-07T14:45:26Z,2018-03-07T14:45:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02684v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02684v1,eess.SP

Decoding movement execution (ME) from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have shown high performance in previous works, however movement imagination (MI) paradigm-based intention decoding has so far failed to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this study, we focused on a robust MI decoding method with transfer learning for the ME and MI paradigm. We acquired EEG data related to arm reaching for 3D directions. We proposed a BCI-transfer learning method based on a Relation network (BTRN) architecture. Decoding performances showed the highest performance compared to conventional works.

Automatic Extraction and Sign Determination of Respiratory Signal in   Real-time Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging,"Chong Chen, Yingmin Liu, Orlando P. Simonetti, Rizwan Ahmad","In real-time (RT) cardiac cine imaging, a stack of 2D slices is collected sequentially under free-breathing conditions. A complete heartbeat from each slice is then used for cardiac function quantification. The inter-slice respiratory mismatch can compromise accurate quantification of cardiac function. Methods based on principal components analysis (PCA) have been proposed to extract the respiratory signal from RT cardiac cine, but these methods cannot resolve the inter-slice sign ambiguity of the respiratory signal. In this work, we propose a fully automatic sign correction procedure based on the similarity of neighboring slices and correlation to the center-of-mass curve. The proposed method is evaluated in eleven volunteers, with ten slices per volunteer. The motion in a manually selected region-of-interest (ROI) is used as a reference. The results show that the extracted respiratory signal has a high, positive correlation with the reference in all cases. The qualitative assessment of images also shows that the proposed approach can accurately identify heartbeats, one from each slice, belonging to the same respiratory phase. This approach can improve cardiac function quantification for RT cine without manual intervention.",2020-02-08T18:54:35Z,2020-02-08T18:54:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03216v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03216v1,eess.IV
Sampling Policy Design for Tracking Time-Varying Graph Signals with   Adaptive Budget Allocation,"Xuan Xie, Hui Feng, Bo Hu","There have been many works that focus on the sampling set design for a static graph signal, but few for time-varying graph signals (GS). In this paper, we concentrate on how to select vertices to sample and how to allocate the sampling budget for a time-varying GS to achieve a minimal tracking error for the long-term. In the Kalman Filter (KF) framework, the problem of sampling policy design and budget allocation is formulated as an infinite horizon sequential decision process, in which the optimal sampling policy is obtained by Dynamic Programming (DP). Since the optimal policy is intractable, an approximate algorithm is proposed by truncating the infinite horizon. By introducing a new tool for analyzing the convexity or concavity of composite functions, we prove that the truncated problem is convex. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach through numerical experiments.",2020-02-14T07:43:03Z,2020-10-23T02:46:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05901v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05901v2,eess.SP

The distributions of the test statistic of detectors for known and unknown noise power are given in theory, and the detection probability is determined. The performance of the detector decreases by 4 dB when the noise power is evaluated with maximum likelihood estimates. Simulations show the effectiveness of the detector under a forward scattering detection configuration with a low signal-to-direct blast ratio.

Such scenarios appear in many practical applications such as radar, optics, and seismic imaging in which the signal of interest can be modeled as the sum of a spectrally sparse and a blocksparse signal known as outlier. Our aim is to demix the two components and for that, we design a convex problem whose objective function promotes both of the structures. Using positive trigonometric polynomials (PTP) theory, we reformulate the dual problem as a semi-definite program (SDP). Our theoretical results states that for a fixed number of measurements N and constant number of outliers, up to O(N) spectral lines can be recovered using our SDP problem as long as a minimum frequency separation condition is satisfied. Our simulation results also show that increasing the number of samples per measurement vectors, reduces the minimum required frequency separation for successful recovery.",2020-04-01T07:20:33Z,2022-09-23T15:39:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00259v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00259v2,eess.SP
Team Channel-SLAM: A Cooperative Mapping Approach to Vehicle   Localization,"Xinghe Chu, Zhaoming Lu, Luhan Wang, Xiangming Wen, David Gesbert","Vehicle positioning is considered a key element in autonomous driving systems. While conventional positioning requires the use of GPS and/or beacon signals from network infrastructure for triangulation, they are sensitive to multi-path and signal obstruction. However, recent proposals like the Channel-SLAM method showed it was possible in principle to in fact leverage multi-path to improve positioning of a single vehicle. In this paper, we derive a cooperative Channel-SLAM framework, which is referred as Team Channel-SLAM. Different from the previous work, Team Channel-SLAM not only exploits the stationary nature of reflecting objects around the receiver to characterize the location of a single vehicle through multi-path signals, but also capitalizes on the multi-vehicle aspects of road traffic to further improve positioning.Specifically, Team Channel-SLAM exploits the correlation between reflectors around multiple neighboring vehicles to achieve high precision multiple vehicle positioning. Our method uses affinity propagation clustering and cooperative particle filter.

Theoretical Analysis of Multi Integrating RX Front-Ends for Lossy   Broad-Band Channels,"Antroy Roy Chowdhury, Shovan Maity, Shreyas Sen","In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of different integrating front-ends employed in broad-band communications through \textit{lossy} channels. Time-domain receivers for broad-band communication typically deal with large integrated noise due to its high bandwidth of operation. However, unlike traditional wireline systems that are typically not noise-limited, channels with high channel-loss render the input signal swing to be very small imposing several challenges in RX design as the circuits operate in the noise-limited regime. This simultaneous high integrated noise and low signal-swing limits the maximum achievable data-rate for a target bit-error-rate (BER) and deteriorates the energy-efficiency of the RX. In this work, transient, noise and gain performance of different standard signaling blocks have been obtained with closed-form expressions and are validated through spice-simulations. Multi-integrator cascade has been proposed which provides significant gain with relatively lower power consumption than the standard gain elements. Also, maximum achievable data-rate and optimum energy efficiency for different channel losses have been obtained theoretically for different architectures revealing their advantages and limitations.

TDOA-based localization with NLOS mitigation via robust model   transformation and neurodynamic optimization,"Wenxin Xiong, Christian Schindelhauer, Hing Cheung So, Joan Bordoy, Andrea Gabbrielli, Junli Liang","This paper revisits the problem of locating a signal-emitting source from time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Many currently fashionable methods for NLOS mitigation in TDOA-based localization tend to solve their optimization problems by means of convex relaxation and, thus, are computationally inefficient. Besides, previous studies show that manipulating directly on the TDOA metric usually gives rise to intricate estimators. Aiming at bypassing these challenges, we turn to retrieve the underlying time-of-arrival framework by treating the unknown source onset time as an optimization variable and imposing certain inequality constraints on it, mitigate the NLOS errors through the $\ell_1$-norm robustification, and finally apply a hardware realizable neurodynamic model based on the redefined augmented Lagrangian and projection theorem to solve the resultant nonconvex optimization problem with inequality constraints.

We also demonstrate how the apparent spectral and temporal properties of transmitted additional, higher-power cover signals (including those using the existing communication protocols) can be made to match those of the low-power stego payload and the Gaussian noise, providing extra layers of obfuscation for both the cover and the stego messages. We further illustrate how a specific combination of linear and nonlinear filtering can be used for effective separation of the cover, payload, and/or ""friendly jamming"" signals even when all transmissions have essentially the same spectral characteristics as well as temporal and amplitude structures, and when there are no explicit differences in the spectral and/or temporal allocations for the cover and the stego messages.",2020-04-28T15:44:31Z,2020-04-28T15:44:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13610v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13610v1,eess.SP

As such, the theory of impropriety has vast applications in medicine, geology, acoustics, optics, image and pattern recognition, computer vision, and other numerous research fields with our main focus on the communication systems. The journey begins from the design of improper Gaussian signaling in the interference-limited communications and leads to a more elaborate and practically feasible asymmetric discrete modulation design. Such asymmetric shaping bridges the gap between theoretically and practically achievable limits with sophisticated transceiver and detection schemes in both coded/uncoded wireless/optical communication systems. Interestingly, introducing asymmetry and adjusting the transmission parameters according to some design criterion render optimal performance without affecting the bandwidth or power requirements of the systems.

A Novel Received Signal Strength Assisted Perspective-three-Point   Algorithm for Indoor Visible Light Positioning,"Lin Bai, Yang Yang, Chunyan Feng, Caili Guo","In this paper, a received signal strength assisted Perspective-three-Point positioning algorithm (R-P3P) is proposed for visible light positioning (VLP) systems. The basic idea of R-P3P is to joint visual and strength information to estimate the receiver position using 3 LEDs regardless of the LEDs' orientations. R-P3P first utilizes visual information captured by the camera to estimate the incidence angles of visible lights. Then, R-P3P calculates the candidate distances between the LEDs and the receiver based on the law of cosines and the Wu-Ritt's zero decomposition method. Based on the incidence angles, the candidate distances and the physical characteristics of the LEDs, R-P3P can select the exact distances from all the candidate distances. Finally, the linear least square (LLS) method is employed to estimate the position of the receiver. Due to the combination of visual and strength information of visible light signals, R-P3P can achieve high accuracy using 3 LEDs regardless of the LEDs' orientations. Simulation results show that R-P3P can achieve positioning accuracy within 10 cm over 70% indoor area with low complexity regardless of LEDs orientations.",2020-05-21T13:57:41Z,2020-05-21T13:57:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11162v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11162v1,eess.SP

Learning Illumination Patterns for Coded Diffraction Phase Retrieval,"Zikui Cai, Rakib Hyder, M.

In this paper, we present a framework to optimize the sensing parameters to improve the quality of the signal recovered by the given iterative method. In particular, we learn illumination patterns to recover signals from coded diffraction patterns using a fixed-cost alternating minimization-based phase retrieval method. Coded diffraction phase retrieval is a physically realistic system in which the signal is first modulated by a sequence of codes before the sensor records its Fourier amplitude. We represent the phase retrieval method as an unrolled network with a fixed number of layers and minimize the recovery error by optimizing over the measurement parameters. Since the number of iterations/layers are fixed, the recovery incurs a fixed cost.

Specifically, by assuming one-bit transmitted signals at the base station (BS), which arises from the use of low-resolution DACs in the regime of massive transmit antennas, a joint design of one-bit SLP at the BS and the phase shifts at the IRS is proposed with a goal of minimizing the worst-case symbol error probability (SEP) of the users under the PSK modulation. This joint design problem is essentially a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). To tackle it, we alternately optimize the one-bit signal and the phase shifts. For the former, a dual of the relaxed one-bit SLP problem is solved by the mirror descent (MD) method with the maximum block improvement (MBI) heuristics. For the latter, the accelerated projected gradient (APG) method is employed to optimize the phases.

Monitoring the smart grid involves analyzing continuous data-stream from various measurement devices deployed throughout the system, which are topologically distributed and structurally interrelated. In this paper, graph signal processing (GSP) has been used to represent and analyze the power grid measurement data. It is shown that GSP can enable various analyses for the power grid's structured data and dynamics of its interconnected components. Particularly, the effects of various cyber and physical stresses in the power grid are evaluated and discussed both in the vertex and the graph-frequency domains of the signals. Several techniques for detecting and locating cyber and physical stresses based on GSP techniques have been presented and their performances have been evaluated and compared. The presented study shows that GSP can be a promising approach for analyzing the power grid's data.",2020-06-10T22:37:47Z,2020-06-10T22:37:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06095v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06095v1,eess.SP
Channel covariance estimation in multiuser massive MIMO systems with an   approach based on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces,"Renato Luis Garrido Cavalcante, Slawomir Stanczak","We propose a novel algorithm to estimate the channel covariance matrix of a desired user in multiuser massive MIMO systems. The algorithm uses only knowledge of the array response and rough knowledge of the angular support of the incoming signals, which are assumed to be separated in a well-defined sense. To derive the algorithm, we study interference patterns with realistic models that treat signals as continuous functions in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. By doing so, we can avoid common and unnatural simplifications such as the presence of discrete signals, ideal isotropic antennas, and infinitely large antenna arrays. An additional advantage of the proposed algorithm is its computational simplicity: it only requires a single matrix-vector multiplication. In some scenarios, simulations show that the estimates obtained with the proposed algorithm are close to those obtained with standard estimation techniques operating in interference-free and noiseless systems.",2020-06-12T08:55:12Z,2020-06-12T08:55:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07007v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07007v1,eess.SP

However, hardware deviations in a parallel processing system (PPS) severely degrade system performance and pose an urgent challenge. We propose a hardware-irrelevant PPS of which the performance is unaffected by hardware deviations. In this system, an embedded convolutional recurrent autoencoder (CRAE), which learns inherent system patterns as well as acquires and removes adverse effects brought by hardware deviations, is adopted. We implement a hardware-irrelevant PPS into a parallel photonic sampling system to accomplish a high-performance analog-to-digital conversion for microwave signals with high frequency and broad bandwidth. Under one system state, a category of signals with two different mismatch degrees is utilized to train the CRAE, which can then compensate for mismatches in various categories of signals with multiple mismatch degrees under random system states.

UWB Radar for through Foliage Imaging using Cyclic Prefix-based OFDM,"G. Ba khadher, A.

The foliage introduces phase and amplitude fluctuation which cause the sidelobes to increase and affects the final image of the obscured targets. The wideband CP-based OFDM SAR inherently eliminates the sidelobes that arise from the interference between targets on the same range line. The integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of the CP-based OFDM signal along the range direction is lower than that of the random noise signal by 2 dB for foliage penetration application, while the peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR) are almost the same of both of the two signals.",2021-08-16T08:42:34Z,2021-08-16T08:42:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06969v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06969v1,"eess.SP, eess.IV"
Blind Modulo Analog-to-Digital Conversion,"Amir Weiss, Everest Huang, Or Ordentlich, Gregory W. Wornell","In a growing number of applications, there is a need to digitize signals whose spectral characteristics are challenging for traditional Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Examples, among others, include systems where the ADC must acquire at once a very wide but sparsely and dynamically occupied bandwidth supporting diverse services, as well as systems where the signal of interest is subject to strong narrowband co-channel interference. In such scenarios, the resolution requirements can be prohibitively high. As an alternative, the recently proposed modulo-ADC architecture can in principle require dramatically fewer bits in the conversation to obtain the target fidelity, but requires that information about the spectrum be known and explicitly taken into account by the analog and digital processing in the converter, which is frequently impractical. To address this limitation, we develop a blind version of the architecture that requires no such knowledge in the converter, without sacrificing performance. In particular, it features an automatic modulo-level adjustment and a fully adaptive modulo unwrapping mechanism, allowing it to asymptotically match the characteristics of the unknown input signal. In addition to detailed analysis, simulations demonstrate the attractive performance characteristics in representative settings.",2021-08-19T22:44:07Z,2021-08-19T22:44:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08937v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08937v1,eess.SP
Graph Signal Processing over a Probability Space of Shift Operators,"Feng Ji, Wee Peng Tay, Antonio Ortega","Graph signal processing (GSP) uses a shift operator to define a Fourier basis for the set of graph signals. The shift operator is often chosen to capture the graph topology. However, in many applications, the graph topology may be unknown a priori, its structure uncertain, or generated randomly from a predefined set for each observation. Each graph topology gives rise to a different shift operator. In this paper, we develop a GSP framework over a probability space of shift operators. We develop the corresponding notions of Fourier transform, MFC filters, and band-pass filters, which subsumes classical GSP theory as the special case where the probability space consists of a single shift operator. We show that an MFC filter under this framework is the expectation of random convolution filters in classical GSP, while the notion of bandlimitedness requires additional wiggle room from being simply a fixed point of a band-pass filter. We develop a mechanism that facilitates mapping from one space of shift operators to another, which allows our framework to be applied to a rich set of scenarios. We demonstrate how the theory can be applied by using both synthetic and real datasets.",2021-08-20T14:21:43Z,2023-03-29T03:37:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09192v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09192v3,eess.SP
RAIL: Robust Acoustic Indoor Localization for Drones,"Alireza Famili, Angelos Stavrou, Haining Wang, Jung-Min, Park","Navigating in environments where the GPS signal is unavailable, weak, purposefully blocked, or spoofed has become crucial for a wide range of applications. A prime example is autonomous navigation for drones in indoor environments: to fly fully or partially autonomously, drones demand accurate and frequent updates of their locations. This paper proposes a Robust Acoustic Indoor Localization (RAIL) scheme for drones designed explicitly for GPS-denied environments. Instead of depending on GPS, RAIL leverages ultrasonic acoustic signals to achieve precise localization using a novel hybrid Frequency Hopping Code Division Multiple Access (FH-CDMA) technique. Contrary to previous approaches, RAIL is able to both overcome the multi-path fading effect and provide precise signal separation in the receiver. Comprehensive simulations and experiments using a prototype implementation demonstrate that RAIL provides high-accuracy three-dimensional localization with an average error of less than $1.5$~cm.",2021-11-06T00:30:36Z,2021-11-06T00:30:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03764v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03764v1,eess.SP
Out-of-Zone Signal Leakage Sensing in Radio Dynamic Zones,"Sung Joon Maeng, ƒ∞smail G√ºven√ß, Mihail L.

In order to operate an RDZ, use of a real-time spectrum monitoring system carries critical importance. Such a monitoring system should detect out-of-zone (OoZ) signal leakage outside of the RDZ, and if the interference to nearby receivers is intolerable, the monitoring system should be capable of mitigating such interference. This can e.g. be achieved by stopping operations inside the RDZ or switching to other bands for RDZ operation. In this paper, we introduce a spectrum monitoring concept for OoZ signal leakage detection at RDZs, where sensor nodes (SNs) are installed at the boundary of an RDZ and monitor the power leakage from multiple transmitters within the RDZ. We propose a prediction algorithm that estimates the received interference at OoZ geographical locations outside of the RDZ, using the measurements obtained at sparsely located SNs at the RDZ boundary.

By the analysis of the properties of the IF equation, we prove that a good IF equation can unify the well-known IF and group delay estimators and provides an effective way to characterize the mixture of time-varying and frequency-varying signals. By discussing the post-processing techniques based on the IF equation, we can prove that many popular TF post-processing methods, such as the synchroextracting transform, the multi-synchrosqueezing transform, and the time extracting transform, fall into the IF equation-based category.

Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification for Security in Low-Cost IoT   Devices,"Guanxiong Shen, Junqing Zhang, Alan Marshall, Mikko Valkama, Joseph Cavallaro","Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) can uniquely classify wireless devices by analyzing the received signal distortions caused by the intrinsic hardware impairments.

However, deep learning-based RFFI requires input data of a fixed size. In addition, many IoT devices work in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios but the low SNR RFFI is rarely investigated. In this paper, the state-of-the-art transformer model is used as the classifier, which can process signals of variable length. Data augmentation is adopted to improve low SNR RFFI performance. A multi-packet inference approach is further proposed to improve the classification accuracy in low SNR scenarios. We take LoRa as a case study and evaluate the system by classifying 10 commercial-off-the-shelf LoRa devices in various SNR conditions.

However, due to the fundamental limited spatial resolution of WiFi signals, it is still very difficult to achieve accurate localization with existing commodity WiFi devices. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose to exploit the degree of freedom provided by the Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), which is composed of a large number of controllable reflective elements, to modulate the spatial distribution of WiFi signals and thus break down the spatial resolution limitation of WiFi signals to achieve accurate localization. Specifically, in the single-person scenario, we derive the closed-form solution to optimally control the phase shift of the IRS elements. In the multi-person scenario, we propose a Side-lobe Cancellation Algorithm to eliminate the near-far effect to achieve accurate localization of multiple persons in an iterative manner.

Underwater Node Localization using Optoacoustic Signals,"Muntasir Mahmud, Mohamed Younis, Gary Carter, Fow-Sen Choa","Localization of underwater networks is important in many military and civil applications. Because GPS receivers do not work below the water surface, traditional localization methods form a relative topology of underwater nodes (UWNs) and utilize either anchor nodes or floating gateways with dual transceivers in order to determine global coordinates. However, these methods introduce logistical complications and security risks in deploying the anchor and/or surface gateways. This paper tackles such an issue by proposing new localization techniques which can remotely localize UWNs using optoacoustic signals. In our approach, GPS coordinates are transmitted from air to the UWN via creating an underwater temporary isotropic acoustic transmitter with the optoacoustic process. We analyze the process of controlling the shape and size of the plasma to create the isotropic acoustic transmitter and experimentally validate the generation of isotropic acoustic signals. Then two methods of localization are proposed for static and dynamic UWNs. Finally, the simulation results with experimental values show the effectiveness of our approach.

iDROP: Robust Localization for Indoor Navigation of Drones with   Optimized Beacon Placement,"Alireza Famili, Angelos Stavrou, Haining Wang, Jung-Min, Park","Drones in many applications need the ability to fly fully or partially autonomously to accomplish their mission. To allow these fully/partially autonomous flights, first, the drone needs to be able to locate itself constantly. Then the navigation command signal would be generated and passed on to the controller unit of the drone. In this paper, we propose a localization scheme for drones called iDROP (Robust Localization for Indoor Navigation of Drones with Optimized Beacon Placement) that is specifically devised for GPS-denied environments (e.g., indoor spaces). Instead of GPS signals, iDROP relies on speaker-generated ultrasonic acoustic signals to enable a drone to estimate its location. In general, localization error is due to two factors: the ranging error and the error induced by relative geometry between the transmitters and the receiver. iDROP mitigates these two types of errors and provides a high-precision three-dimensional localization scheme for drones. iDROP employs a waveform that is robust against multi-path fading. Moreover, by placing beacons in optimal locations, it reduces the localization error induced by the relative geometry between the transmitters and the receiver.",2022-01-26T01:23:28Z,2022-01-26T01:23:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10698v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10698v1,eess.SP

However, these assumptions are often violated due to source motion. In this paper, we propose a signal model that captures the linear variations in DOA within a block. We applied conventional beamforming (CBF) algorithm to this model to estimate linear DOA trajectories.

Multi-user Beam-Alignment for Millimeter-Wave Networks,"Rana A.

Nevertheless, communication at these frequencies requires narrow beams via massive MIMO and beamforming to overcome the strong signal attenuation, and thus precise beam-alignment between transmitter and receiver is needed. The resulting signaling overhead may become a severe impairment, especially in mobile networks with high users density. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize the beam-alignment protocol to minimize the signaling overhead. In this paper, the design of energy efficient joint beam-alignment protocols for two users is addressed, with the goal to minimize the power consumption during data transmission, subject to rate constraints for both users, under analog beamforming constraints. It is proved that a bisection search algorithm is optimal. Additionally, the optimal scheduling strategy of the two users in the data communication phase is optimized based on the outcome of beam-alignment, according to a time division multiplexing scheme.

Design of graph filters depends on the shift matrix eigendecomposition. Consequently, random graphs present a challenge as this information is often difficult to obtain.

Recent works based on compression models have shown that these approaches are suitable to ECG biometric identification. However, the best results are usually achieved by the methods that, at least, rely on one point of interest of the ECG.   In this work, we propose a compression-based non-fiducial method, that uses a measure of similarity, called the Normalized Relative Compression -- a measure related to the Kolmogorov complexity of strings. Our method uses extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCMs) on the quantized first-order derivative of the signal, instead of using directly the original signal, as other methods do.   We were able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a database collected at the University of Aveiro, which was used on previous works, making it a good preliminary benchmark for the method.",2018-03-15T13:52:09Z,2018-03-15T13:52:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00959v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00959v1,eess.SP
Visual detection of time-varying signals: opposing biases and their   timescales,"Urit Gordon, Shimon Marom, Naama Brenner","Human visual perception is a complex, dynamic and fluctuating process. In addition to the incoming visual stimulus, it is affected by many other factors including temporal context, both external and internal to the observer. In this study we investigate the dynamic properties of psychophysical responses to a continuous stream of visual near-threshold detection tasks. We manipulate the incoming signals to have temporal structures with various characteristic timescales. Responses of human observers to these signals are analyzed using tools that highlight their dynamical features as well.   We find that two opposing biases shape perception, and operate over distinct timescales. Positive recency appears over short times, e.g. consecutive trials. Adaptation, entailing an increased probability of changed response, reflects trends over longer times. Analysis of psychometric curves conditioned on various temporal events reveals that the balance between the two biases can shift depending on their interplay with the temporal properties of the input signal. A simple mathematical model reproduces the experimental data in all stimulus regimes. Taken together, our results support the view that visual response fluctuations reflect complex internal dynamics, possibly related to higher cognitive processes.",2018-04-09T09:46:36Z,2018-04-09T09:46:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02885v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02885v1,q-bio.NC
Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform A New Variant to Fractional   Signal Processing Definition and Properties,Sanjay Kumar,"In this paper, a new variant to fractional signal processing is proposed known as the Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform. Various properties satisfied by its transformation kernel is derived. The properties associated with the proposed Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform like shift, modulation, time-frequency shift property are also derived and it is shown mathematically that when the rotation angle of Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform approaches 90 degrees, the proposed Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform reduces to the conventional Fourier transform. Also, the Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform of various kinds of signals is also derived and it is shown that the obtained analytical expressions of different Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform are a reduced form of the conventional fractional Fourier transform. It is also shown that proposed definition of Fractional Fourier Transform is easier to be handled analytically. Finally, the convolution theorem associated with the proposed Reduced Order Fractional Fourier Transform is derived with its various properties like shift convolution, modulation convolution, and time-frequency shift modulation properties. It has been shown that with this proposed new definition of fractional Fourier transform, the convolution theorem has been reduced to multiplication in the fractional frequency domain.",2018-04-17T09:38:45Z,2018-04-17T09:38:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06131v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06131v1,eess.SP

This paper presents a broadband HBC transceiver implemented in 65nm CMOS that achieves 6.3pJ/b energy efficiency at 30Mbps with -30dB interference-tolerance. Capacitive termination at the receiver end is used to achieve a wideband HBC channel, and Time Domain Signal-Interference Separation (TD-SIS) using Integrating DDR (I-DDR) receiver allows a tolerance of -30 dB Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) with a BER <10-3. The transceiver achieves 18X improvement in energy-efficiency compared to the State-of-the-Art HBC transceivers while being simultaneously broadband (carrier-less, low-energy) and interference-robust. Such order-of-magnitude improvement in energy-efficiency and private communication through the human body may enable applications like closed-loop neuromodulation, health-monitoring, secure authentication among many others.",2018-04-17T13:51:45Z,2018-04-17T13:51:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06743v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06743v1,eess.SP
Generalized Approximate Message Passing for Unlimited Sampling of Sparse   Signals,"Osman Musa, Peter Jung, Norbert Goertz","In this paper we consider the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm for recovering a sparse signal from modulo samples of randomized projections of the unknown signal. The modulo samples are obtained by a self-reset (SR) analog to digital converter (ADC). Additionally, in contrast to previous work on SR ADC, we consider a scenario where the compressed sensing (CS) measurements (i.e., randomized projections) are sent through a communication channel, namely an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel before being quantized by a SR ADC. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations for both noiseless and noisy case. The results show strong ability of the proposed algorithm to fight the nonlinearity of the SR ADC, as well as the possible additional distortion introduced by the AWGN channel.",2018-07-09T14:13:27Z,2018-07-09T14:13:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03182v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03182v1,eess.SP
Cross-layer Interference Modeling for 5G MmWave Networks in the Presence   of Blockage,"Solmaz Niknam, Reza Barazideh, Balasubramaniam Natarajan","Fifth generation (5G) wireless technology is expected to utilize highly directive antennas at millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum to offer higher data rates. However, given the high directivity of antennas and adverse propagation characteristics at mmWave frequencies, these signals are very susceptible to obstacles. One of the important factors that are highly impacted is interference behavior. In fact, signals received from other terminals can be easily blocked or attenuated at the receiver. In addition, higher number of terminals can transmit signals without introducing much interference and hence the traffic behavior, maintained by medium access control (MAC) layer, may change. In this paper, we provide an interference model to evaluate the interference power received at the physical layer of the receiving terminal, considering antenna directivity, effect of obstacles and MAC layer constraints that control the number of terminals transmitting simultaneously. We first develop a blockage model and then derive the Laplace transform of the interference power received at a typical receiving node. Subsequently, using the derived Laplace transform, we evaluate the network error performance using average bit-error-rate (BER). Analytical results are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.",2018-07-11T15:49:43Z,2018-07-11T15:49:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04206v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04206v1,eess.SP
Network-Assisted Resource Allocation with Quality and Conflict   Constraints for V2V Communications,"Luis F. Abanto-Leon, Arie Koppelaar, Sonia Heemstra de Groot","The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has recently established in Rel. 14 a network-assisted resource allocation scheme for vehicular broadcast communications. Such novel paradigm is known as vehicle--to--vehicle (V2V) \textit{mode-3} and consists in eNodeBs engaging only in the distribution of sidelink subchannels among vehicles in coverage. Thereupon, without further intervention of the former, vehicles will broadcast their respective signals directly to their counterparts. Because the allotment of subchannels takes place intermittently to reduce signaling, it must primarily be conflict-free in order not to jeopardize the reception of signals. We have identified four pivotal types of allocation requirements that must be guaranteed: one quality of service (QoS) requirement and three conflict conditions which must be precluded in order to preserve reception reliability. The underlying problem is formulated as a maximization of the system sum-capacity with four types of constraints that must be enforced. In addition, we propose a three-stage suboptimal approach that is cast as multiple independent knapsack problems (MIKPs). We compare the two approaches through simulations and show that the latter formulation can attain acceptable performance at lesser complexity.",2018-07-12T21:24:13Z,2018-07-12T21:24:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04829v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04829v1,eess.SP
Generalized Graph Connections for Dataflow Modeling of DSP Applications,"Yanzhou Liu, Lee Barford, Shuvra S. Bhattacharyya","In dataflow representations for signal processing systems, applications are represented as directed graphs in which vertices represent computations and edges correspond to buffers that store data as it passes between computations. The buffers are single-input, single-output components that manage data in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) fashion. In this paper, we generalize the concept of dataflow buffers with a concept called ""passive blocks"". Like dataflow buffers, passive blocks are used to store data during the intervals between its generation by producing actors, and its use by consuming actors. However, passive blocks can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, and can incorporate operations on and rearrangements of the stored data subject to certain constraints. We define a form of flowgraph representation that is based on replacing dataflow edges with the proposed concept of passive blocks. We present a structured design methodology for utilizing this new form of signal processing flowgraph, and demonstrate its utility in improving memory management efficiency, and execution time performance.",2018-07-16T08:19:07Z,2018-07-16T08:19:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05721v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05721v1,eess.SP

Both techniques rely on the eigendecomposition of the cor- relation matrix estimated after embedding the signal into its delayed coordi- nates. In this work we show that the eigenvectors can be used to calculate the coefficients of a set of filters which form a filter bank. The properties of these filters are derived. In particular we show that their outputs can be grouped according to their frequency response. Furthermore, the fre- quency at the maximum of each frequency response and the corresponding eigenvalue can provide a power spectrum estimation of the time series. Two different applications illustrate how both characteristics can be applied to analyze wideband signals in order to achieve narrow-band signals or to infer their frequency occupation.",2018-07-27T15:19:23Z,2018-07-27T15:19:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10679v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10679v1,eess.SP

Emitter Identification Using CNN IQ Imbalance Estimators,"Lauren J. Wong, William C. Headley, Alan J. Michaels","Specific Emitter Identification is the association of a received signal to a unique emitter, and is made possible by the naturally occurring and unintentional characteristics an emitter imparts onto each transmission, known as its radio frequency fingerprint. This work presents an approach for identifying emitters using Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the IQ imbalance parameters of each emitter, using only raw IQ data as input. Because an emitter's IQ imbalance parameters will not change as it changes modulation schemes, the proposed approach has the ability to track emitters, even as they change modulation scheme. The performance of the developed approach is evaluated using simulated quadrature amplitude modulation and phase-shift keying signals, and the impact of signal-to-noise ratio, imbalance value, and modulation scheme are considered. Further, the developed approach is shown to outperform a comparable feature-based approach, while making fewer assumptions and using less data.",2018-08-07T13:51:27Z,2018-08-07T13:51:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02369v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02369v1,eess.SP
Advances in Distributed Graph Filtering,"Mario Coutino, Elvin Isufi, Geert Leus","Graph filters are one of the core tools in graph signal processing. A central aspect of them is their direct distributed implementation. However, the filtering performance is often traded with distributed communication and computational savings. To improve this tradeoff, this work generalizes state-of-the-art distributed graph filters to filters where every node weights the signal of its neighbors with different values while keeping the aggregation operation linear. This new implementation, labeled as edge-variant graph filter, yields a significant reduction in terms of communication rounds while preserving the approximation accuracy. In addition, we characterize the subset of shift-invariant graph filters that can be described with edge-variant recursions. By using a low-dimensional parametrization the proposed graph filters provide insights in approximating linear operators through the succession and composition of local operators, i.e., fixed support matrices, which span applications beyond the field of graph signal processing.

(o)HEAR attenuated PD artifacts by approx. 25 dB, and at the same time maintained a high SNR during PD artifact-free periods. For real-world EEG data, (o)HEAR reduced the fraction of outlier trials by half and maintained the waveform of a movement related cortical potential during a center-out reaching task.

Time encoding of bandlimited signals: reconstruction by pseudo-inversion   and time-varying multiplierless FIR filtering,"Nguyen T. Thao, Dominik Rzepka","We propose an entirely redesigned framework of bandlimited signal reconstruction for the time encoding machine (TEM) introduced by Lazar and T\'oth. As the encoding part of TEM consists in obtaining integral values of a bandlimited input over known time intervals, it theoretically amounts to applying a known linear operator on the input. We then approach the general question of signal reconstruction by pseudo-inversion of this operator. We perform this task numerically and iteratively using projections onto convex sets (POCS). The algorithm can be implemented exactly in discrete time with multiplications that are all reduced to scaling by signed powers of two, thanks to the use of relaxation coefficients. Meanwhile, the algorithm achieves a rate of convergence similar to that of Lazar and T\'oth. For real-time processing, we propose an approximate time-varying FIR implementation, which avoids the splitting of the input into blocks.

Evaluation of convolutional neural networks using a large multi-subject   P300 dataset,Lukas Vareka,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have been studied in various machine learning areas. For example, event-related potential (ERP) signal classification is a highly complex task potentially suitable for DNN as signal-to-noise ratio is low, and underlying spatial and temporal patterns display a large intra- and intersubject variability. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been compared with baseline traditional models, i.e. linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) for single trial classification using a large multi-subject publicly available P300 dataset of school-age children (138 males and 112 females). For single trial classification, classification accuracy stayed between 62% and 64% for all tested classification models. When applying the trained classification models to averaged trials, accuracy increased to 76-79% without significant differences among classification models.

A Bayesian Framework for Power System Components Identification,"Artem Mikhalev, Alexander Emchinov, Samuel Chevalier, Yury Maximov, Petr Vorobev","Having actual models for power system components (such as generators and loads or auxiliary equipment) is vital to correctly assess the power system operating state and to establish stability margins. However, power system operators often have limited information about the actual values for power system component parameters. Even when a model is available, its operating parameters and control settings are time-dependent and subject to real-time identification. Ideally, these parameters should be identified from measurement data, such as phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals. However, it is challenging to do this from the ambient measurements in the absence of transient dynamics since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for such signals is not necessarily large. In this paper, we design a Bayesian framework for on-line identification of power system component parameters based on ambient PMU data, which has reliable performance for SNR as low as five and for certain parameters can give good estimations even for unit SNR. We support the framework with a robust and time-efficient numerical method.

In this paper, a newly suboptimal method based on modified artificial bee colony (ABC-PTS) algorithm is proposed to search the better combination of phase factors. The ABC-PTS algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity for larger PTS subblocks and offers lower PAPR at the same time.

However, existing SST requires much processing time for large-scale data. In this paper, some fast implementation methods of SST based on downsampled short-time Fourier transform (STFT) are proposed. By controlling the downsampling factor both in time and frequency, combined with the proposed selective reassignment and frequency subdivision scheme, one can keep a balance between efficiency and accuracy according to practical needs. Moreover, the reconstruction property is available, accomplished by an approximate but direct inverse formula under downsampling. The effects of parameters on the concentration, computing efficiency, and reconstruction accuracy are also investigated quantitatively, followed by a mathematic model of reassignment behavior with decimate factors. Experimental results on an aero-engine and a spindle show that the fast implementation of SST can effectively characterize the non-stationary characteristics of the large-scale vibration signal to reveal the mechanism of mechanical systems.",2020-03-16T08:06:01Z,2020-03-16T08:06:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07065v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07065v1,eess.SP

Recently, graph signal processing has risen to prominence, and adaptive distributed solutions have also been proposed in the area. Both in the classical framework and in graph signal processing, sampling and censoring techniques have been topics of intense research, since the cost associated with measuring and/or transmitting data throughout the entire network may be prohibitive in certain applications. In this paper, we propose a low-cost adaptive mechanism for sampling and censoring over diffusion networks that uses information from more nodes when the error in the network is high and from less nodes otherwise. It presents fast convergence during transient and a significant reduction in computational cost and energy consumption in steady state. As a censoring technique, we show that it is able to noticeably outperform other solutions.

In addition, the GLRT is not necessarily optimal and its performance may degrade for non-asymptotic scenarios that are characterized by close hypotheses and small sample sizes. In this paper we propose a new detection method, named the generalized locally most powerful unbiased (GLMPU) test, which is a general method for local detection in the presence of nuisance parameters. A closed-form expression of the GLMPU test is developed for the detection of frequency deviation in the case where the complex amplitudes of the measured signals are unknown.

Unlike the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in most existing works that only forwards the signals in a reflective way, the IOS is capable to forward the received signals to the MU in either a reflective or a transmissive manner, thereby enhancing the wireless coverage. We formulate an IOS phase shift optimization problem to maximize the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) of the MU. The optimal phase shift of the IOS is analysed, and a branch-and-bound based algorithm is proposed to design the IOS phase shift in a finite set. Simulation results show that the IOS-assisted system can extend the coverage significantly when compared to the IRS-assisted system with only reflective signals.",2020-09-15T06:09:07Z,2020-09-15T06:09:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06878v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06878v1,eess.SP
A Preliminary Study of Machine-Learning-Based Ranging with LTE Channel   Impulse Response in Multipath Environment,"Halim Lee, Jiwon Seo","Alternative navigation technology to global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) is required for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in multipath environments (such as urban areas). In urban areas, long-term evolution (LTE) signals can be received ubiquitously at high power without any additional infrastructure. We present a machine learning approach to estimate the range between the LTE base station and UGV based on the LTE channel impulse response (CIR). The CIR, which includes information of signal attenuation from the channel, was extracted from the LTE physical layer using a software-defined radio (SDR). We designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates ranges with the CIR as input. The proposed method demonstrated better ranging performance than a received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based method during our field test.",2020-09-24T19:09:21Z,2020-09-24T19:09:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11910v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11910v1,eess.SP
Reference Signal-Aided Channel Estimation in Spatial Media-Based   Modulation Systems,"Akif Kabacƒ±, Mehmet Ba≈üaran, Hakan Ali √áƒ±rpan","In this letter, we study the reference signal-aided channel estimation concept which is a crucial requirement to address the realistic performance of spatial media-based modulation (SMBM) systems where the radio frequency mirrors are deployed along with the multiple transmit antennas. Accordingly, least squares and linear minimum mean square error-based channel estimation schemes are proposed for MBM-based systems for the first time in the literature where former studies mainly assume either perfect channel state information or an error model on channel coefficients. In addition, corresponding symbol detection performance is studied. To measure the efficiency of the proposed channel estimation approaches, the theoretical upper bounds on average bit error rate are derived and shown to be well overlapped with the computer simulations for the medium and high signal-to-noise ratio regions. This study is important due to the implementation of channel estimation as well as the theoretical derivation of detection bounds for MBM-based communication systems.",2020-09-28T11:55:21Z,2020-09-28T11:55:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13231v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13231v1,eess.SP
Clustering-based Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for   Grant-free NOMA,"Ayoob Salari, Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam, Muhammad Basit Shahab, Reza Arablouei, Sarah Johnson","We propose a joint channel estimation and signal detection technique for the uplink non-orthogonal multiple access using an unsupervised clustering approach. We apply the Gaussian mixture model to cluster received signals and accordingly optimize the decision regions to enhance the symbol error rate (SER). We show that when the received powers of the users are sufficiently different, the proposed clustering-based approach with no channel state information (CSI) at the receiver achieves an SER performance similar to that of the conventional maximum likelihood detector with full CSI. Since the accuracy of the utilized clustering algorithm depends on the number of the data points available at the receiver, the proposed technique delivers a tradeoff between the accuracy and block length.",2020-10-07T00:06:43Z,2020-10-07T00:06:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03091v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03091v1,eess.SP
Space-Time Adaptive Detection at Low Sample Support,"Benjamin D. Robinson, Robert Malinas, Alfred O. Hero III","An important problem in space-time adaptive detection is the estimation of the large p-by-p interference covariance matrix from training signals. When the number of training signals n is greater than 2p, existing estimators are generally considered to be adequate, as demonstrated by fixed-dimensional asymptotics. But in the low-sample-support regime (n < 2p or even n < p) fixed-dimensional asymptotics are no longer applicable. The remedy undertaken in this paper is to consider the ""large dimensional limit"" in which n and p go to infinity together. In this asymptotic regime, a new type of estimator is defined (Definition 2), shown to exist (Theorem 1), and shown to be detection-theoretically ideal (Theorem 2). Further, asymptotic conditional detection and false-alarm rates of filters formed from this type of estimator are characterized (Theorems 3 and 4) and shown to depend only on data that is given, even for non-Gaussian interference statistics. The paper concludes with several Monte Carlo simulations that compare the performance of the estimator in Theorem 1 to the predictions of Theorems 2-4, showing in particular higher detection probability than Steiner and Gerlach's Fast Maximum Likelihood estimator.",2020-10-07T13:02:59Z,2020-10-07T13:02:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03388v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03388v1,eess.SP
Displaced Sensor Automotive Radar Imaging,"Guohua Wang, Kumar Vijay Mishra","Displaced automotive sensor imaging exploits joint processing of the data acquired from multiple radar units, each of which may have limited individual resources, to enhance the localization accuracy. Prior works either consider perfect synchronization among the sensors, employ single antenna radars, entail high processing cost, or lack performance analyses. Contrary to these works, we develop a displaced multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signal model under coarse synchronization with only frame-level alignment. We derive Bayesian performance bounds for the common automotive radar processing modes such as point-cloud-based fusion as well as raw-signal-based non-coherent and coherent imaging. For the non-coherent mode, which offers a compromise between low computational load and improved localization, we exploit the block sparsity of range profiles for signal reconstruction to avoid direct computational imaging with massive data. For the high-resolution coherent imaging, we develop a method that automatically estimates the synchronization error and performs displaced radar imaging by exploiting sparsity-driven recovery models. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate these advantages. Our proposed non-coherent processing of displaced MIMO FMCW radars improves position estimation by an order over the conventional point-cloud fusion.",2020-10-06T04:58:46Z,2020-10-06T04:58:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04085v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04085v1,"eess.SP, eess.IV"
Riemannian geometry-based decoding of the directional focus of auditory   attention using EEG,"Simon Geirnaert, Tom Francart, Alexander Bertrand","Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms decode the auditory attention from electroencephalography (EEG) signals that capture the listener's neural activity. Such AAD methods are believed to be an important ingredient towards so-called neuro-steered assistive hearing devices. For example, traditional AAD decoders allow detecting to which of multiple speakers a listener is attending to by reconstructing the amplitude envelope of the attended speech signal from the EEG signals. Recently, an alternative paradigm to this stimulus reconstruction approach was proposed, in which the directional focus of auditory attention is determined instead, solely based on the EEG, using common spatial pattern filters (CSP). Here, we propose Riemannian geometry-based classification (RGC) as an alternative for this CSP approach, in which the covariance matrix of a new EEG segment is directly classified while taking its Riemannian structure into account. While the proposed RGC method performs similarly to the CSP method for short decision lengths (i.e., the amount of EEG samples used to make a decision), we show that it significantly outperforms it for longer decision window lengths.",2020-10-14T15:43:55Z,2021-02-01T14:34:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07171v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07171v2,eess.SP
Non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction using automatic speech   recognition derived measures,"Mahdie Karbasi, Stefan Bleeck, Dorothea Kolossa","The estimation of speech intelligibility is still far from being a solved problem. Especially one aspect is problematic: most of the standard models require a clean reference signal in order to estimate intelligibility. This is an issue of some significance, as a reference signal is often unavailable in practice. In this work, therefore a non-intrusive speech intelligibility estimation framework is presented. In it, human listeners' performance in keyword recognition tasks is predicted using intelligibility measures that are derived from models trained for automatic speech recognition (ASR). One such ASR-based and one signal-based measure are combined into a full framework, the proposed NO-Reference Intelligibility (Nori) estimator, which is evaluated in predicting the performance of both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in multiple noise conditions. It is shown that the Nori framework even outperforms the widely used reference-based (or intrusive) short-term objective intelligibility (STOI) measure in most considered scenarios, while being applicable in fully blind scenarios with no reference signal or transcription, creating perspectives for online and personalized optimization of speech enhancement systems.",2020-10-16T18:14:27Z,2021-10-28T17:25:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08574v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08574v2,eess.AS
Block Coordinate Descent Algorithms for Auxiliary-Function-Based   Independent Vector Extraction,"Rintaro Ikeshita, Tomohiro Nakatani, Shoko Araki","In this paper, we address the problem of extracting all super-Gaussian source signals from a linear mixture in which (i) the number of super-Gaussian sources $K$ is less than that of sensors $M$, and (ii) there are up to $M - K$ stationary Gaussian noises that do not need to be extracted. To solve this problem, independent vector extraction (IVE) using a majorization minimization and block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithms has been developed, attaining robust source extraction and low computational cost. We here improve the conventional BCDs for IVE by carefully exploiting the stationarity of the Gaussian noise components. We also newly develop a BCD for a semiblind IVE in which the transfer functions for several super-Gaussian sources are given a priori. Both algorithms consist of a closed-form formula and a generalized eigenvalue decomposition. In a numerical experiment of extracting speech signals from noisy mixtures, we show that when $K = 1$ in a blind case or at least $K - 1$ transfer functions are given in a semiblind case, the convergence of our proposed BCDs is significantly faster than those of the conventional ones.",2020-10-18T10:56:27Z,2021-05-04T02:36:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08959v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08959v2,"eess.SP, eess.AS"
Python (deep learning and machine learning) for EEG signal processing on   the example of recognizing the disease of alcoholism,Ildar Rakhmatulin,"Alcoholism is one of the most common diseases in the world. This type of substance abuse leads to mental and physical dependence on ethanol-containing drinks. Alcoholism is accompanied by progressive degradation of the personality and damage to the internal organs. Today still not exists a quick diagnosis method to detect this disease. This article presents the method for the quick and anonymous alcoholism diagnosis by neural networks. For this method, don't need any private information about the subject. For the implementation, we considered various algorithms of machine learning and deep neural networks. In detail analyzed the correlation of the signals from electrodes by neural networks.

Spectral folding and two-channel filter-banks on arbitrary graphs,"Eduardo Pavez, Benjamin Girault, Antonio Ortega, Philip A. Chou","In the past decade, several multi-resolution representation theories for graph signals have been proposed. Bipartite filter-banks stand out as the most natural extension of time domain filter-banks, in part because perfect reconstruction, orthogonality and bi-orthogonality conditions in the graph spectral domain resemble those for traditional filter-banks. Therefore, many of the well known orthogonal and bi-orthogonal designs can be easily adapted for graph signals. A major limitation is that this framework can only be applied to the normalized Laplacian of bipartite graphs. In this paper we extend this theory to arbitrary graphs and positive semi-definite variation operators. Our approach is based on a different definition of the graph Fourier transform (GFT), where orthogonality is defined with the respect to the Q inner product. We construct GFTs satisfying a spectral folding property, which allows us to easily construct orthogonal and bi-orthogonal perfect reconstruction filter-banks.

Distributed speech separation in spatially unconstrained microphone   arrays,"Nicolas Furnon, Romain Serizel, Irina Illina, Slim Essid","Speech separation with several speakers is a challenging task because of the non-stationarity of the speech and the strong signal similarity between interferent sources. Current state-of-the-art solutions can separate well the different sources using sophisticated deep neural networks which are very tedious to train. When several microphones are available, spatial information can be exploited to design much simpler algorithms to discriminate speakers. We propose a distributed algorithm that can process spatial information in a spatially unconstrained microphone array. The algorithm relies on a convolutional recurrent neural network that can exploit the signal diversity from the distributed nodes. In a typical case of a meeting room, this algorithm can capture an estimate of each source in a first step and propagate it over the microphone array in order to increase the separation performance in a second step. We show that this approach performs even better when the number of sources and nodes increases. We also study the influence of a mismatch in the number of sources between the training and testing conditions.",2020-11-02T13:59:04Z,2021-02-08T14:40:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00982v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00982v2,eess.SP
"Exploring the Synchrony Between Body Temperature and HR, RR, and Aortic   Blood Pressure in Viral/Bacterial Disease Onsets with Signal Dynamics",Camille Dunning,"Signal-based early detection of illnesses has been a key topic in research and hospital settings; it reduces technological costs and paves the way for quick and effective patient-care operations. Elementary machine learning and signal processing algorithms have proven to be sufficient in classifying the onset of viral and bacterial conditions before clinical symptoms are shown. Inspired by these recent developments, this project employs signal dynamics analysis to infer changes in vital signs (temperature, respiration, and heart rate). The results demonstrate that the trends of one vital function can be predicted from that of another. In particular, it is shown that heart rate and respiration typically change shortly after body temperature, and aortic blood pressure follows.

Direction of Arrival Estimation for Non-Coherent Sub-Arrays via Joint   Sparse and Low-Rank Signal Recovery,"Tom Tirer, Oded Bialer","Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of multiple sources from a single snapshot obtained by a coherent antenna array is a well-known problem, which can be addressed by sparse signal reconstruction methods, where the DOAs are estimated from the peaks of the recovered high-dimensional signal. In this paper, we consider a more challenging DOA estimation task where the array is composed of non-coherent sub-arrays (i.e., sub-arrays that observe different unknown phase shifts due to using low-cost unsynchronized local oscillators). We formulate this problem as the reconstruction of a joint sparse and low-rank matrix and solve its convex relaxation. While the DOAs can be estimated from the solution of the convex problem, we further show how an improvement is obtained if instead one estimates from this solution the phase shifts, creates ""phase-corrected"" observations and applies another final (plain, coherent) sparsity-based DOA estimation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms strategies that are based on non-coherent processing of the sub-arrays as well as other sparsity-based methods.",2020-11-04T00:48:15Z,2020-11-04T00:48:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02083v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02083v1,eess.SP

As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the algorithm's performance by reducing electromyogram noise in electroencephalograms with the usage of a custom, flexible, 3D-printed, compound electrode. With this setup, an average of 4dB and a maximum of 10dB improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG was achieved by removing wide band muscle noise. This concept has the potential to not only adaptively improve the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG but can be applied to a wide range of biological, industrial and consumer applications such as industrial sensing or noise cancelling headphones.",2020-11-06T16:41:05Z,2022-09-25T13:26:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03466v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03466v6,eess.SP

Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition of EEG for Mental State   Detection at Localized Brain Lobes,"Monira Islam, Tan Lee","In this study, the Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) approach is applied to extract features from multi-channel EEG signals for mental state classification. MEMD is a data-adaptive analysis approach which is suitable particularly for multi-dimensional non-linear signals like EEG. Applying MEMD results in a set of oscillatory modes called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). As the decomposition process is data-dependent, the IMFs vary in accordance with signal variation caused by functional brain activity. Among the extracted IMFs, it is found that those corresponding to high-oscillation modes are most useful for detecting different mental states. Non-linear features are computed from the IMFs that contribute most to mental state detection. These MEMD features show a significant performance gain over the conventional tempo-spectral features obtained by Fourier transform and Wavelet transform. The dominance of specific brain region is observed by analysing the MEMD features extracted from associated EEG channels. The frontal region is found to be most significant with a classification accuracy of 98.06%. This multi-dimensional decomposition approach upholds joint channel properties and produces most discriminative features for EEG based mental state detection.",2022-06-02T08:42:22Z,2022-06-02T08:42:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00926v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00926v1,eess.SP
Semi-supervised MIMO Detection Using Cycle-consistent Generative   Adversarial Network,"Hongzhi Zhu, Yongliang Guo, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You","In this paper, a new semi-supervised deep multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection approach using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is proposed for communication systems without any prior knowledge of underlying channel distributions. Specifically, we propose the CycleGAN detector by constructing a bidirectional loop of two modified least squares generative adversarial networks (LS-GAN). The forward LS-GAN learns to model the transmission process, while the backward LS-GAN learns to detect the received signals. By optimizing the cycle-consistency of the transmitted and received signals through this loop, the proposed method is trained online and semi-supervisedly using both the pilots and the received payload data. As such, the demand on labelled training dataset is considerably controlled, and thus the overhead is effectively reduced. Numerical results show that the proposed CycleGAN detector achieves better performance in terms of both bit error-rate (BER) and achievable rate than existing semi-blind deep learning (DL) detection methods as well as conventional linear detectors, especially when considering signal distortion due to the nonlinearity of power amplifiers (PA) at the transmitter.",2022-06-08T05:53:25Z,2023-04-21T08:03:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03686v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03686v4,eess.SP

For nonintersecting constraints, the method of simultaneous projections produces a minimum mean square error (MMSE) solution. In certain cases, a minimax solution is more desirable. Generating a minimax solution is possible using dilated POCS. The minimax solution uses morphological dilation of nonintersecting signal convex constraints. The sets are progressively dilated to the point where there is intersection at a minimax solution. Examples are given contrasting the MMSE and minimax solutions in problems of tomographic reconstruction of images. Dilated POCS adds a new imaging modality for image synthesis.

Generative Adversarial Networks for Pseudo-Radio-Signal Synthesis,"Haythem Chaker, Soumaya Hamouda, Nicola Michailow","For many wireless communication applications, traffic pattern modeling of radio signals combined with channel effects is much needed. While analytical models are used to capture these phenomena, real world non-linear effects (e.g. device responses, interferences, distortions, noise) and especially the combination of such effects can be difficult to capture by these models. This is simply due to their complexity and degrees of freedom which can be hard to explicitize in compact expressions. In this paper, we propose a more model-free approach to jointly approximate an end-to-end black-boxed wireless communication scenario using software-defined radio platforms and optimize for an efficient synthesis of subsequently similar 'pseudo-radio-signals'. More precisely, we implement a generative adversarial network based solution that automatically learns radio properties from recorded prototypes in specific scenarios. This allows for a high degree of expressive freedom.

Conversely, a signal processing perspective enables us to shed new light on the technique. In our previous work, we analyzed the spectra of historical Lippmann plates using our own mathematical model. In this paper, we provide the derivation of this model and validate it experimentally. We highlight new behaviors whose explanations were ignored by physicists to date. In particular, we show that the spectra generated by Lippmann plates are in fact distorted versions of the original spectra.

Multiple Selection Extrapolation for Improved Spatial Error Concealment,"J√ºrgen Seiler, Andr√© Kaup","This contribution introduces a novel signal extrapolation algorithm and its application to image error concealment. The signal extrapolation is carried out by iteratively generating a model of the signal suffering from distortion. Thereby, the model results from a weighted superposition of two-dimensional basis functions whereas in every iteration step a set of these is selected and the approximation residual is projected onto the subspace they span. The algorithm is an improvement to the Frequency Selective Extrapolation that has proven to be an effective method for concealing lost or distorted image regions. Compared to this algorithm, the novel algorithm is able to reduce the processing time by a factor larger than three, by still preserving the very high extrapolation quality.",2022-07-14T10:19:50Z,2022-07-14T10:19:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06795v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06795v1,eess.IV
Adaptive frequency prior for frequency selective reconstruction of   images from non-regular subsampling,"J√ºrgen Seiler, Andr√© Kaup","Image signals typically are defined on a rectangular two-dimensional grid. However, there exist scenarios where this is not fulfilled and where the image information only is available for a non-regular subset of pixel position. For processing, transmitting or displaying such an image signal, a re-sampling to a regular grid is required. Recently, Frequency Selective Reconstruction (FSR) has been proposed as a very effective sparsity-based algorithm for solving this under-determined problem. For this, FSR iteratively generates a model of the signal in the Fourier-domain. In this context, a fixed frequency prior inspired by the optical transfer function is used for favoring low-frequency content. However, this fixed prior is often too strict and may lead to a reduced reconstruction quality. To resolve this weakness, this paper proposes an adaptive frequency prior which takes the local density of the available samples into account. The proposed adaptive prior allows for a very high reconstruction quality, yielding gains of up to 0.6 dB PSNR over the fixed prior, independently of the density of the available samples. Compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, visually noticeable gains of several dB are possible.",2022-07-14T10:23:06Z,2022-07-14T10:23:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06797v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06797v1,eess.IV
Orthogonality Deficiency Compensation for Improved Frequency Selective   Image Extrapolation,"J√ºrgen Seiler, Katrin Meisinger, Andr√© Kaup","This paper describes a very efficient algorithm for image signal extrapolation. It can be used for various applications in image and video communication, e.g. the concealment of data corrupted by transmission errors or prediction in video coding. The extrapolation is performed on a limited number of known samples and extends the signal beyond these samples. Therefore the signal from the known samples is iteratively projected onto different basis functions in order to generate a model of the signal. As the basis functions are not orthogonal with respect to the area of the known samples we propose a new extension, the orthogonality deficiency compensation, to cope with the non-orthogonality. Using this extension, very good extrapolation results for structured as well as for smooth areas are achievable. This algorithm improves PSNR up to 2 dB and gives a better visual quality for concealment of block losses compared to extrapolation algorithms existent so far.",2022-07-20T08:05:07Z,2022-07-20T08:05:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09724v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09724v1,eess.IV

Neuromorphic implementation of ECG anomaly detection using delay chains,"Stefan Gerber, Marc Steiner, Maryada, Giacomo Indiveri, Elisa Donati","Real-time analysis and classification of bio-signals measured using wearable devices is computationally costly and requires dedicated low-power hardware. One promising approach is to use spiking neural networks implemented using in-memory computing architectures and neuromorphic electronic circuits. However, as these circuits process data in streaming mode without the possibility of storing it in external buffers, a major challenge lies in the processing of spatio-temporal signals that last longer than the time constants present in the network synapses and neurons. Here we propose to extend the memory capacity of a spiking neural network by using parallel delay chains. We show that it is possible to map temporal signals of multiple seconds into spiking activity distributed across multiple neurons which have time constants of few milliseconds. We validate this approach on an ECG anomaly detection task and present experimental results that demonstrate how temporal information is properly preserved in the network activity.",2022-09-02T20:38:46Z,2022-09-02T20:38:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01266v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01266v1,eess.SP
Periodic and non-periodic brainwaves emerging via random syncronization   of closed loops of firing neurons,"P. Mazzetti, A. Carbone","Periodic and nonperiodic components of electrophysiological signals are modelled in terms of syncronized sequences of closed loops of firing neurons correlated in Markov chains. Single closed loops of firing neurons reproduce fundamental and harmonic components, appearing as lines in the power spectra at frequencies ranging about from $0.5 Hz$ to $ 100 Hz$. Further interesting features of the brainwave signals emerge by considering multiple syncronized sequences of closed loops. In particular, we show that the fluctuations of the number of syncronized loops leads to the onset of broadband power spectral components.   By effect of the fluctuations of the number of synchronized loops and the emergence of the related broadband component, highly distorted waveform and nonstationarity of the signal are observed, consistently with empirical EEG and MEG signals. The analytical relationships of the periodic and aperiodic components are evaluated by using typical firing neuron pulse amplitudes and durations.",2022-08-30T09:14:44Z,2022-08-30T09:14:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08083v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08083v1,q-bio.NC

MMS-MSG: A Multi-purpose Multi-Speaker Mixture Signal Generator,"Tobias Cord-Landwehr, Thilo von Neumann, Christoph Boeddeker, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach","The scope of speech enhancement has changed from a monolithic view of single, independent tasks, to a joint processing of complex conversational speech recordings. Training and evaluation of these single tasks requires synthetic data with access to intermediate signals that is as close as possible to the evaluation scenario. As such data often is not available, many works instead use specialized databases for the training of each system component, e.g WSJ0-mix for source separation. We present a Multi-purpose Multi-Speaker Mixture Signal Generator (MMS-MSG) for generating a variety of speech mixture signals based on any speech corpus, ranging from classical anechoic mixtures (e.g., WSJ0-mix) over reverberant mixtures (e.g., SMS-WSJ) to meeting-style data. Its highly modular and flexible structure allows for the simulation of diverse environments and dynamic mixing, while simultaneously enabling an easy extension and modification to generate new scenarios and mixture types. These meetings can be used for prototyping, evaluation, or training purposes. We provide example evaluation data and baseline results for meetings based on the WSJ corpus. Further, we demonstrate the usefulness for realistic scenarios by using MMS-MSG to provide training data for the LibriCSS database.",2022-09-23T09:40:01Z,2022-09-23T09:40:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11494v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11494v1,eess.AS
Seventy Years of Radar and Communications: The Road from Separation to   Integration,"Fan Liu, Le Zheng, Yuanhao Cui, Christos Masouros, Athina P. Petropulu, Hugh Griffiths, Yonina C. Eldar","Radar and communications (R&C) as key utilities of electromagnetic (EM) waves have fundamentally shaped human society and triggered the modern information age. Although R&C have been historically progressing separately, in recent decades they have been converging towards integration, forming integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, giving rise to new, highly desirable capabilities in next-generation wireless networks and future radars. To better understand the essence of ISAC, this paper provides a systematic overview on the historical development of R&C from a signal processing (SP) perspective. We first interpret the duality between R&C as signals and systems, followed by an introduction of their fundamental principles. We then elaborate on the two main trends in their technological evolution, namely, the increase of frequencies and bandwidths, and the expansion of antenna arrays. We then show how the intertwined narratives of R&C evolved into ISAC, and discuss the resultant SP framework. Finally, we overview future research directions in this field.",2022-10-02T07:23:01Z,2023-04-30T13:09:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00446v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00446v2,eess.SP
URGLQ: An Efficient Covariance Matrix Reconstruction Method for Robust   Adaptive Beamforming,"Tao Luo, Peng Chen, Zhenxin Cao, Le Zheng, Zongxin Wang","The computational complexity of the conventional adaptive beamformer is relatively large, and the performance degrades significantly due to the model mismatch errors and the unwanted signals in received data. In this paper, an efficient unwanted signal removal and Gauss-Legendre quadrature (URGLQ)-based covariance matrix reconstruction method is proposed. Different from the prior covariance matrix reconstruction methods, a projection matrix is constructed to remove the unwanted signal from the received data, which improves the reconstruction accuracy of the covariance matrix. Considering that the computational complexity of most matrix reconstruction algorithms is relatively large due to the integral operation, we proposed a Gauss-Legendre quadrature-based method to approximate the integral operation while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, to improve the robustness of the beamformer, the mismatch in the desired steering vector is corrected by maximizing the output power of the beamformer under a constraint that the corrected steering vector cannot converge to any interference steering vector. Simulation results and prototype experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed beamformer outperforms the compared methods and is much closer to the optimal beamformer in different scenarios.",2022-10-05T12:55:22Z,2023-03-29T02:22:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02214v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02214v3,eess.SP

In the process, the respiratory motion is estimated for contact-free vital sign monitoring. The received signal is modeled by a backscatter channel and the respiratory motion and propagation channels are estimated using VMP. We use the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to approximate the model evidence for the detection. Numerical analyses and measurements demonstrate that the proposed method leads to a significant improvement in the detection performance compared to a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based detector or an estimator-correlator, since the multipath components (MPCs) are better incorporated into the detection procedure.

Cepstral Coefficients for Earthquake Damage Assessment of Bridges   Leveraging Deep Learning,"Seyedomid Sajedi, Xiao Liang","Bridges are indispensable elements in resilient communities as essential parts of the lifeline transportation systems. Knowledge about the functionality of bridge structures is crucial, especially after a major earthquake event. In this study, we propose signal processing approaches for automated AI-equipped damage detection of bridges. Mel-scaled filter banks and cepstral coefficients are utilized for training a deep learning architecture equipped with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers that consider the temporal variations in a signal. The proposed framework has been validated on an RC bridge structure in California. The bridge is subjected to 180 bi-directional ground motion records with sampled scale factors and six different intercept angles. Compared with the benchmark cumulative intensity features, the Mel filter banks resulted in 15.5% accuracy in predicting critical drift ratios.

ADMM based Fourier phase retrieval with untrained generative prior,"Liyuan Ma, Hongxia Wang, Ningyi Leng, Ziyang Yuan","Fourier phase retrieval (FPR) is an inverse problem that recovers the signal from its Fourier magnitude measurement, it's ill-posed especially when the sampling rates are low. In this paper, an untrained generative prior is introduced to attack the ill-posedness. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an algorithm utilizing the untrained generative network called Net-ADM is proposed to solve the FPR problem. Firstly, the objective function is smoothed and the dimension of the variable is raised to facilitate calculation. Then an untrained generative network is embedded in the iterative process of ADMM to project an estimated signal into the generative space, and the projected signal is applied to next iteration of ADMM. We theoretically analyzed the two projections included in the algorithm, one makes the objective function descent, and the other gets the estimation closer to the optimal solution. Numerical experiments show that the reconstruction performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm are superior to prior works, especially when the sampling rates are low.",2022-10-23T08:07:28Z,2022-10-23T08:07:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12646v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.12646v1,eess.SP
Hypothesis Test Procedures for Detecting Leakage Signals in Water   Pipeline Channels,"Liusha Yang, Matthew R. McKay, Xun Wang","We design statistical hypothesis tests for performing leak detection in water pipeline channels. By applying an appropriate model for signal propagation, we show that the detection problem becomes one of distinguishing signal from noise, with the noise being described by a multivariate Gaussian distribution with unknown covariance matrix. We first design a test procedure based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, which we show through simulations to offer appreciable leak detection performance gain over conventional approaches designed in an analogous context (for radar detection). Our proposed method requires estimation of the noise covariance matrix, which can become inaccurate under high-dimensional settings, and when the measurement data is scarce. To deal with this, we present a second leak detection method, which employs a regularized covariance matrix estimate. The regularization parameter is optimized for the leak detection application by applying results from large dimensional random matrix theory. This second proposed approach is shown to yield improved performance in leak detection compared with the first approach, at the expense of requiring higher computational complexity.",2022-10-24T08:31:36Z,2022-10-24T08:31:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13032v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13032v1,eess.SP

Specifically, for any given digraph we propose three GFT designs based on the polar decomposition. Our method is closely related to existing polar decomposition based GFT designs, but with added interpretability in the digraph node-domain. Each of our proposed digraph GFTs has a clear node domain variation interpretation, so that one or more of the GFTs can be used to extract different insights from available graph signals. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach experimentally using M-block cyclic graphs, showing that the diffusion of signals on the graph leads to changes in the spectrum obtained from our proposed GFTs, but cannot be observed with the conventional GFT definition.",2023-04-10T01:54:22Z,2023-04-10T01:54:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04350v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04350v1,eess.SP

In this work, the feasibility of hand kinematics decoding using EEG cortical source signals has been explored for grasp and lift task. In particular, pre-movement EEG segment is utilized. A residual convolutional neural network (CNN) - long short-term memory (LSTM) based kinematics decoding model is proposed that utilizes motor neural information present in pre-movement brain activity. Various EEG windows at 50 ms prior to movement onset, are utilized for hand kinematics decoding.

All-condition pulse detection using a magnetic sensor,"Haoxuan Shen, Xiaoyi Gu, Yihong Wu","A plethora of wearable devices have been developed or commercialized for continuous non-invasive monitoring of physiological signals that are crucial for preventive care and management of chronic conditions. However, most of these devices are either sensitive to skin conditions or its interface with the skin due to the requirement that the external stimuli such as light or electrical excitation must penetrate the skin to detect the pulse. This often results in large motion artefacts and unsuitability for certain skin conditions. Here, we demonstrate a simple fingertip-type device which can detect clear pulse signals under all conditions, including fingers covered by opaque substances such as a plaster or nail polish, or fingers immersed in liquid. The device has a very simple structure, consisting of only a pair of magnets and a magnetic sensor. We show through both experiments and simulations that the detected pulsation signals correspond directly to the magnet vibrations caused by blood circulation, and therefore, in addition to heartrate detection, the proposed device can also be potentially used for blood pressure measurement.",2023-04-19T14:30:02Z,2023-04-19T14:30:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09689v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09689v1,eess.SP

This method applies a novel NMF algorithm, which embodies a parallel structure of multilayer units on the input signal, to find a proper estimation of source signals. Another key innovation is the use of the periodic property of the signals which improves accuracy compared to previous works. The method is tested on 100 cases. Each case consists of two synthesized mixtures of real measurements. The effect of different parameters is discussed, and the results are compared to other current methods.

Unsupervised Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Dual-Path   Knowledge-Aware Auto-Encoders,"Zhiheng Guo, Yuanzhang Xiao, Xiang Chen","In this paper, an unsupervised deep learning framework based on dual-path model-driven variational auto-encoders (VAE) is proposed for angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) and channel estimation in massive MIMO systems. Specifically designed for channel estimation, the proposed VAE differs from the original VAE in two aspects. First, the encoder is a dual-path neural network, where one path uses the received signal to estimate the path gains and path angles, and another uses the correlation matrix of the received signal to estimate AoAs. Second, the decoder has fixed weights that implement the signal propagation model, instead of learnable parameters. This knowledge-aware decoder forces the encoder to output meaningful physical parameters of interests (i.e., path gains, path angles, and AoAs), which cannot be achieved by original VAE. Rigorous analysis is carried out to characterize the multiple global optima and local optima of the estimation problem, which motivates the design of the dual-path encoder. By alternating between the estimation of path gains, path angles and the estimation of AoAs, the encoder is proved to converge. To further improve the convergence performance, a low-complexity procedure is proposed to find good initial points. Numerical results validate theoretical analysis and demonstrate the performance improvements of our proposed framework.",2023-05-30T04:54:06Z,2023-05-30T04:54:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18744v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18744v1,eess.SP

Trade-offs between saturation and resolution arise in many applications, like radar, where sensors acquire signals which exhibit a high degree of variability in amplitude. To solve this issue, we propose the use of the co-design approach of the USF which acquires folded version of the signal of interest and leverages its structure to reconstruct it after its acquisition. We demonstrate that this method outperforms other standard acquisition methods for Doppler radars. Taking our theory all the way to practice, we develop a prototype USF-enabled Doppler Radar and show the clear benefits of our method.

Complex Graph Laplacian Regularizer for Inferencing Grid States,"Chinthaka Dinesh, Junfei Wang, Gene Cheung, Pirathayini Srikantha","In order to maintain stable grid operations, system monitoring and control processes require the computation of grid states (e.g. voltage magnitude and angles) at high granularity. It is necessary to infer these grid states from measurements generated by a limited number of sensors like phasor measurement units (PMUs) that can be subjected to delays and losses due to channel artefacts, and/or adversarial attacks (e.g. denial of service, jamming, etc.). We propose a novel graph signal processing (GSP) based algorithm to interpolate states of the entire grid from observations of a small number of grid measurements. It is a two-stage process, where first an underlying Hermitian graph is learnt empirically from existing grid datasets. Then, the graph is used to interpolate missing grid signal samples in linear time. With our proposal, we can effectively reconstruct grid signals with significantly smaller number of observations when compared to existing traditional approaches (e.g. state estimation). In contrast to existing GSP approaches, we do not require knowledge of the underlying grid structure and parameters and are able to guarantee fast spectral optimization.

In this paper, we propose a structured matrix recovery technique (SMART) for CM DOA estimation via fully exploiting the two structures. In particular, we reformulate the highly nonconvex CM DOA estimation problems in the noiseless and noisy cases as equivalent rank-constrained Hankel-Toeplitz matrix recovery problems, in which the Vandermonde structure is captured by a series of Hankel-Toeplitz block matrices, of which the number equals the number of snapshots, and the CM structure is guaranteed by letting the block matrices share a same Toeplitz submatrix. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is applied to solve the resulting rank-constrained problems and the DOAs are uniquely retrieved from the numerical solution. Extensive simulations are carried out to corroborate our analysis and confirm that the proposed SMART outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the maximum number of locatable sources and statistical efficiency.",2023-07-15T14:03:25Z,2023-07-15T14:03:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07806v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07806v1,eess.SP

On Optimality in ROVir,Justin P. Haldar,"We recently published an approach named ROVir (Region-Optimized Virtual coils) that uses the beamforming capabilities of a multichannel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) receiver array to achieve coil compression (reducing an original set of receiver channels into a much smaller number of virtual channels for the purposes of dimensionality reduction), while simultaneously preserving the MRI signal from desired spatial regions and suppressing the MRI signal arising from unwanted spatial regions. The original ROVir procedure is computationally-simple to implement (involving just a single small generalized eigendecomposition), and its signal-suppression capabilities have proven useful in an increasingly wide range of MRI applications. Our original paper made claims about the theoretical optimality of this generalized eigendecomposition procedure, but did not present the details. The purpose of this write-up is to elaborate on these mathematical details, and to introduce a new greedy iterative ROVir algorithm that enjoys certain advantages over the original ROVir calculation approach. This discussion is largely academic, with implications that we suspect will be minor for practical applications -- we have only observed small improvements to ROVir performance in the cases we have tried, and it would have been safe in these cases to still use the simpler original calculation procedure with negligible practical impact on the final imaging results.",2023-07-20T22:32:09Z,2023-07-20T22:32:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11258v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11258v1,eess.SP
Grid Hopping: Accelerating Direct Estimation Algorithms for Multistatic   FMCW Radar,"Gilles Monnoyer, Thomas Feuillen, Maxime Drouguet, Laurent Jacques, Luc Vandendorpe","This paper presents a novel signal processing technique, coined grid hopping, as well as an active multistatic Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar system designed to evaluate its performance. The design of grid hopping is motivated by two existing estimation algorithms. The first one is the indirect algorithm estimating ranges and speeds separately for each received signal, before combining them to obtain location and velocity estimates. The second one is the direct method jointly processing the received signals to directly estimate target location and velocity. While the direct method is known to provide better performance, it is seldom used because of its high computation time. Our grid hopping approach, which relies on interpolation strategies, offers a reduced computation time while its performance stays on par with the direct method. We validate the efficiency of this technique on actual FMCW radar measurements and compare it with other methods.",2023-07-31T10:30:24Z,2023-07-31T10:30:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16550v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16550v1,eess.SP
Digital Self-Interference Cancellation With Robust Multi-layered Total   Least Mean Squares Adaptive Filters,"Shiyu Song, Yanqun Tang, Xizhang Wei, Yu Zhou, Xianjie Lu, Zhengpeng Wang, Songhu Ge","In simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) wireless communications, digital self-interference (SI) cancellation is required before estimating the remote transmission (RT) channel. Considering the inherent connection between SI channel reconstruction and RT channel estimation, we propose a multi-layered M-estimate total least mean squares (m-MTLS) joint estimator to estimate both channels. In each layer, our proposed m-MTLS estimator first employs an M-estimate total least mean squares (MTLS) algorithm to eliminate residual SI from the received signal and give a new estimation of the RT channel. Then, it gives the final RT channel estimation based on the weighted sum of the estimation values obtained from each layer. Compared to traditional minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and single-layered MTLS estimator, it demonstrates that the m-MTLS estimator has better performance of normalized mean squared difference (NMSD). Besides, the simulation results also show the robustness of m-MTLS estimator even in scenarios where the local reference signal is contaminated with noise, and the received signal is impacted by strong impulse noise.",2023-08-06T15:25:16Z,2023-08-06T15:25:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03137v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03137v1,eess.SP
Deep generative models for unsupervised delamination detection using   guided waves,"Mahindra Rautela, Amin Maghareh, Shirley Dyke, S. Gopalakrishnan","With the rising demands for robust structural health monitoring procedures for aerospace structures, the scope of intelligent algorithms and learning techniques is expanding. Supervised algorithms have shown promising results in the field provided a large, balanced, and labeled amount of data for training. For some applications like aerospace, the data collection process is cumbersome, time-taking, and costly. Also, generating possible damage scenarios in a laboratory setup is challenging because of the complexity of the damage initiation and failure mechanism. Besides this, the uncertainties of the real-time operation restrict the online prediction accuracy with supervised learning. In this paper, deep generative models are proposed for unsupervised delamination prediction as an anomaly detection problem. In this one-class-based model, the deep learning network is trained to learn the distribution of baseline signals. In the testing phase, damage signals and unseen baseline signals are fed into the trained network to predict the state of the structure, i.e., healthy or unhealthy (delamination).

Inferring Power Grid Information with Power Line Communications: Review   and Insights,"Javier Hernandez Fernandez, Abdulah Jarouf, Aymen Omri, Roberto Di Pietro","High-frequency signals were widely studied in the last decade to identify grid and channel conditions in power lines. PLMs operating on the grid's physical layer are capable of transmitting such signals to infer information about the medium. When applied to the electrical grid, one of the key advantages of PLC is its capacity to use signals to provide information about the grid itself. This makes PLC an ideal communication technology for smart grid applications, particularly in the realms of grid monitoring and surveillance. In this paper, we focus on PLC grid information inference and provide several contributions: a classification of PLC-based applications, a review of the relevant literature, and insights to further advance the field.

Frequency-Space Prediction Filtering for Phase Aberration Correction in   Plane-Wave Ultrasound,"Mostafa Sharifzadeh, Habib Benali, Hassan Rivaz","Ultrasound imaging often suffers from image degradation stemming from phase aberration, which represents a significant contributing factor to the overall image degradation in ultrasound imaging. Frequency-space prediction filtering or FXPF is a technique that has been applied within focused ultrasound imaging to alleviate the phase aberration effect. It presupposes the existence of an autoregressive (AR) model across the signals received at the transducer elements and removes any components that do not conform to the established model. In this study, we illustrate the challenge of applying this technique to plane-wave imaging, where, at shallower depths, signals from more distant elements lose relevance, and a fewer number of elements contribute to image reconstruction. While the number of contributing signals varies, adopting a fixed-order AR model across all depths, results in suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose an AR model with an adaptive order and quantify its effectiveness using contrast and generalized contrast-to-noise ratio metrics.",2023-08-22T23:29:13Z,2023-08-22T23:29:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11830v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11830v1,"eess.IV, eess.SP"

ESPRIT algorithm has been used to estimate the pulse locations. However, existing theoretical analysis is restricted to ideal assumptions on signal and measurement models. We present a novel perturbation analysis that overcomes the previous theoretical limitation, which is derived without a stringent assumption on the signal model. Our unifying analysis applies to various sub-array designs of the ESPRIT algorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of the perturbation analysis by specifying the result in two practical scenarios. In the first scenario, we quantify how the number of snapshots for stable recovery scales when the number of Fourier measurements per snapshot is sufficiently large. In the second scenario, we propose compressive blind array calibration by ESPRIT with random sub-arrays and provide the corresponding non-asymptotic error bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the empirical performance of ESPRIT corroborates the theoretical analysis through extensive numerical results.",2023-08-30T18:47:18Z,2023-08-30T18:47:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16265v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16265v1,eess.SP
Purposeful Co-Design of OFDM Signals for Ranging and Communications,"Andrew Graff, Todd E.

These trade-offs are quantified through the Shannon capacity bound, probability of outage, and the Ziv-Zakai bound on range estimation variance. Bounds are derived for signals experiencing frequency-selective Rayleigh block fading, accounting for the impact of limited channel knowledge and multi-antenna reception. Uncompensated carrier frequency offset and phase errors are also factored into the capacity bounds. Analysis based on the derived bounds demonstrates how Pareto-optimal design choices can be made to optimize the communication throughput, probability of outage, and ranging variance. Different pilot resource allocation strategies are then analyzed, showing how Pareto-optimal design choices change depending on the channel.",2023-09-06T15:24:42Z,2024-01-30T16:14:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03076v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03076v3,eess.SP
Comparing Iterative and Least-Squares Based Phase Noise Tracking in   Receivers with 1-bit Quantization and Oversampling,"Florian Gast, Stephan Zeitz, Meik D√∂rpinghaus, Gerhard P.

It was proposed to use 1-bit ADCs to mitigate this problem. Moreover, oscillator phase noise is predicted to be especially high at sub-THz carrier frequencies. For synchronization the phase must be tracked based on 1-bit quantized observations. We study iterative data-aided phase estimation, i.e., the expectation-maximization and the Fisher-scoring algorithm, compared to least-squares (LS) phase estimation. For phase interpolation at the data symbols, we consider the Kalman filter and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel algorithm. Compared to LS estimation, iterative phase noise tracking leads to a significantly lower estimation error variance at high signal-to-noise ratios.

Base Station Beamforming Design for Near-field XL-IRS Beam Training,"Tao Wang, Changsheng You, Changchuan Yin","Existing research on extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) beam training has assumed the far-field channel model for base station (BS)-IRS link. However, this approach may cause degraded beam training performance in practice due to the near-field channel model of the BS-IRS link. To address this issue, we propose two efficient schemes to optimize BS beamforming for improving the XL-IRS beam training performance. Specifically, the first scheme aims to maximize total received signal power on the XL-IRS, which generalizes the existing angle based BS beamforming design and can be resolved using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The second scheme aims to maximize the $\ell_1$-norm of incident signals on the XL-IRS, which is shown to achieve the maximum received power at the user. To solve the non-convex $\ell_1$-norm maximization problem, we propose an eficient algorithm by using the alternating optimization (AO) technique. Numerical results show that the proposed AO based BS beamforming design outperforms the SVD/angle based BS beamforming in terms of training accuracy and achievable received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).",2023-09-12T14:17:51Z,2023-09-12T14:17:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06259v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06259v1,eess.SP

The aim of this letter is to study the achievable performance of FAS when more than one ports can be activated. We do so by analyzing the outage probability of this setup in Rayleigh fading channels through the utilization of Gauss-Chebyshev integration, lower bound estimation, and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic approximations.

Energy-efficient Integrated Sensing and Communication System and DNLFM   Waveform,"Yihua Ma, Zhifeng Yuan, Shuqiang Xia, Chen Bai, Zhongbin Wang, Yuxin Wang","Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler of 6G. Unlike communication radio links, the sensing signal requires to experience round trips from many scatters. Therefore, sensing is more power-sensitive and faces a severer multi-target interference. In this paper, the ISAC system employs dedicated sensing signals, which can be reused as the communication reference signal. This paper proposes to add time-frequency matched windows at both the transmitting and receiving sides, which avoids mismatch loss and increases energy efficiency. Discrete non-linear frequency modulation (DNLFM) is further proposed to achieve both time-domain constant modulus and frequency-domain arbitrary windowing weights. DNLFM uses very few Newton iterations and a simple geometrically-equivalent method to generate, which greatly reduces the complex numerical integral in the conventional method. Moreover, the spatial-domain matched window is proposed to achieve low sidelobes.

Characterizing the non-monotonic behavior of mutual information along   biochemical reaction cascades,"Raymond Fan, Andreas Hilfinger","Cells sense environmental signals and transmit information intracellularly through changes in the abundance of molecular components. Such molecular abundances can be measured in single cells and exhibit significant heterogeneity in clonal populations even in identical environments. Experimentally observed joint probability distributions can then be used to quantify the covariability and mutual information between molecular abundances along signaling cascades. However, because stationary state abundances along stochastic biochemical reaction cascades are not conditionally independent, their mutual information is not constrained by the data processing inequality. Here, we report the conditions under which the mutual information between stationary state abundances increases along a cascade of biochemical reactions. This non-monotonic behavior can be intuitively understood in terms of noise propagation and time-averaging stochastic fluctuations that are short-lived compared to an extrinsic signal. Our results re-emphasize that mutual information measurements of stationary state distributions of cellular components may be of limited utility for characterizing cellular signaling processes because they do not measure information transfer.",2023-09-18T21:18:21Z,2024-08-08T17:19:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10162v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10162v2,q-bio.QM
A Generalized Approach for Recovering Time Encoded Signals with Finite   Rate of Innovation,Dorian Florescu,"In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering a sum of filtered Diracs, representing an input with finite rate of innovation (FRI), from its corresponding time encoding machine (TEM) measurements. So far, the recovery was guaranteed for cases where the filter is selected from a number of particular mathematical functions. Here, we introduce a new generalized method for recovering FRI signals from the TEM output. On the theoretical front, we significantly increase the class of filters for which reconstruction is guaranteed, and provide a condition for perfect input recovery depending on the first two local derivatives of the filter. We extend this result with reconstruction guarantees in the case of noise corrupted FRI signals. On the practical front, in cases where the filter has an unknown mathematical function, the proposed method streamlines the recovery process by bypassing the filter modelling stage. We validate the proposed method via numerical simulations with filters previously used in the literature, as well as filters that are not compatible with the existing results.

This paper proposes a Bayesian approach for adaptive EMG pattern classification using semi-supervised sequential learning. The proposed method uses a Bayesian classification model based on Gaussian distributions to predict the motion class and estimate its confidence. Pseudo-labels are subsequently assigned to data with high-prediction confidence, and the posterior distributions of the model are sequentially updated within the framework of Bayesian updating, thereby achieving adaptive motion recognition to alterations in signal characteristics over time. Experimental results on six healthy adults demonstrated that the proposed method can suppress the degradation of classification accuracy over time and outperforms conventional methods.

Although clipping reduces the nonlinear distortion caused by power amplifiers (PAs), it induces additional clipping distortion. Optimizing the joint system performance with consideration of both PA nonlinearity and clipping distortion remains an open problem due to the complex PA modeling. In this paper, we analyze the PA nonlinearity through the Bessel-Fourier PA (BFPA) model and simplify its power expression using inter-modulation product (IMP) analysis.

In particular, we show that, based on the scrambled signal, the eavesdropper can formulate a blind source separation problem and recover data symbols and TMA parameters via independent component analysis (ICA) techniques. We show how the scaling and permutation ambiguities arising in ICA can be resolved by exploiting the Toeplitz structure of the corresponding mixing matrix, and knowledge of data constellation, OFDM specifics, and the rules for choosing TMA parameters.

The operators use dedicated frequency bands, but each RIS inadvertently reflects the transmitted uplink signals of the user equipment devices in multiple bands. Consequently, the concurrent reflection of pilot signals during the channel estimation phase introduces a new inter-operator pilot contamination effect. We investigate the implications of this effect in systems with either deterministic or correlated Rayleigh fading channels, specifically focusing on its impact on channel estimation quality, signal equalization, and channel capacity. The numerical results demonstrate the substantial degradation in system performance caused by this phenomenon and highlight the pressing need to address inter-operator pilot contamination in multi-operator RIS deployments.

The receiver extracts the channel parameters from the signal and estimates the channel environment, thus locating the reflectors in the environment. The proposed scheme can effectively solve the problem of interference between signals in the same time-frequency domain but in different spatial domains when multiple RRUs jointly serve users in CF-RAN architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed passive ISAC scheme can effectively detect reflector location information in the environment without degrading the communication performance.",2023-11-10T11:30:38Z,2024-11-23T09:57:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06003v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06003v2,eess.SP

Specifically, we adapt the Poisson Total Variation processing technique to cater to this application. By assuming a Poisson noise model for the photon count observations, our approach yields denoised estimates of backscatter photon flux and related parameters. This facilitates the processing of raw photon counting signals with exceptionally high temporal and range resolutions (demonstrated here to 50 Hz and 75 cm resolutions), including data acquired through time-correlated single photon counting, without significant sacrifice of resolution.

A Belief Propagation Approach for Direct Multipath-Based SLAM,"Mingchao Liang, Erik Leitinger, Florian Meyer","In this work, we develop a multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method that can directly be applied to received radio signals. In existing multipath-based SLAM approaches, a channel estimator is used as a preprocessing stage that reduces data flow and computational complexity by extracting features related to multipath components (MPCs). We aim to avoid any preprocessing stage that may lead to a loss of relevant information. The presented method relies on a new statistical model for the data generation process of the received radio signal that can be represented by a factor graph. This factor graph is the starting point for the development of an efficient belief propagation (BP) method for multipath-based SLAM that directly uses received radio signals as measurements.

Weiss-Weinstein bound of frequency estimation error for very weak GNSS   signals,"Xin Zhang, Xingqun Zhan, Jihong Huang, Jiahui Liu, Yingchao Xiao","Tightness remains the center quest in all modern estimation bounds. For very weak signals, this is made possible with judicial choices of prior probability distribution and bound family.

In addition, of all bounds in Bayesian framework, Weiss-Weinstein bound (WWB) stands out since it is free from regularity conditions or requirements on the prior distribution. Therefore, WWB is extended for the current frequency estimation problem. A divide-and-conquer type of hyperparameter tuning method is developed to level off the curse of computational complexity for the WWB family while enhancing tightness.

By exploring the relationship between waveform-domain adaptive matched filtering (WD-AMF) output and waveform-domain signals, we demonstrate that ISRJ can be effectively suppressed when the transmitted waveform exhibits waveform-domain complementarity. We introduce a phase-coded (PC) waveform set with waveform-domain complementarity and propose a method for generating such waveform sets of arbitrary code lengths. The performance of WD-AMF are further developed due to the designed waveforms, and simulations affirm the superior adaptive anti-jamming capabilities of the designed waveforms compared to traditional ones.

Therefore, this paper proposes a compression codec, which is based upon the parametric higher-order Directional Audio Coding (HO-DirAC) model. The encoder downmixes the higher-order Ambisonic (HOA) input audio into a reduced number of signals, which are accompanied by perceptually-motivated scene parameters. The downmixed audio is coded using a perceptual audio coder, whereas the parameters are grouped into perceptual bands, quantized, and downsampled. On the decoder side, low Ambisonic orders are fully recovered. Not fully recoverable HOA components are synthesized according to the parameters.

This leads to a reduction of the computational complexity and obtaining of more accurate DOA estimates. Given the more reliable DOA estimates, the method also allows for the estimation of more accurate mutual coupling coefficients. The method utilizes an integrated dictionary in order to iteratively refine the active parameter space, thereby reducing the required computational complexity without reducing the overall performance. The complexity is further reduced by employing only the dominant subspace of the measured signal.

To overcome this challenge, we first analyze the statistical characteristics of the random ACF under the symbol-wise pulse shaping (SWPS) regime. As a step further, we formulate an optimization problem to design ISAC pulse shaping filters, which minimizes the average integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) while meeting the Nyquist criterion, subject to power and bandwidth constraints.

One main difficulty of the THz communication is the severe signal attenuation caused by the foliage loss, oxygen/atmospheric absorption, body and hand losses. To compensate for the severe path loss, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array-based beamforming has been widely used. Since the beams should be aligned with the signal propagation path to achieve the maximum beamforming gain, acquisition of accurate channel knowledge, i.e., channel estimation, is of great importance. An aim of this paper is to propose a new type of deep learning (DL)-based parametric channel estimation technique. In our work, DL figures out the mapping function between the received pilot signal and the sparse channel parameters characterizing the spherical domain channel. By exploiting the long short-term memory (LSTM), we can efficiently extract the temporally correlated features of sparse channel parameters and thus make an accurate estimation with relatively small pilot overhead.

Distributed PMCW Radar Network in Presence of Phase Noise,"Jialun Kou, Marc Bauduin, Andr√© Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin","In Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) radar systems, the phase noise from the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) can increase the noise floor in the Range-Doppler map. The adverse effects of phase noise on close targets can be mitigated if the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) employ the same chirp, a phenomenon known as the range correlation effect.   In the context of a multi-static radar network, sharing the chirp between distant radars becomes challenging. Each radar generates its own chirp, leading to uncorrelated phase noise. Consequently, the system performance cannot benefit from the range correlation effect.   Previous studies show that selecting a suitable code sequence for a Phase Modulated Continuous Waveform (PMCW) radar can reduce the impact of uncorrelated phase noise in the range dimension.

In this paper, we explore an application of deep unrolling in the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation problem when coarse quantization is applied to the measurements. We present a compressed sensing formulation for DoA estimation from one-bit data in which estimating target DoAs requires recovering a sparse signal from a limited number of severely quantized linear measurements. In particular, we exploit covariance recovery from one-bit dither samples. To recover the covariance of transmitted signal, the learned iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (LISTA) is employed fed by one-bit data. We demonstrate that the upper bound of estimation performance is governed by the recovery error of the transmitted signal covariance matrix. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the proposed LISTA-based algorithm's capability in estimating target locations.

Since the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks enables mission-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or smart manufacturing, the resulting malfunctions can cause serious damage.

MAMCA -- Optimal on Accuracy and Efficiency for Automatic Modulation   Classification with Extended Signal Length,"Yezhuo Zhang, Zinan Zhou, Yichao Cao, Guangyu Li, Xuanpeng Li","With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things ecosystem, Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) has become increasingly paramount. However, extended signal lengths offer a bounty of information, yet impede the model's adaptability, introduce more noise interference, extend the training and inference time, and increase storage overhead. To bridge the gap between these requisites, we propose a novel AMC framework, designated as the Mamba-based Automatic Modulation ClassificAtion (MAMCA). Our method adeptly addresses the accuracy and efficiency requirements for long-sequence AMC. Specifically, we introduce the Selective State Space Model as the backbone, enhancing the model efficiency by reducing the dimensions of the state matrices and diminishing the frequency of information exchange across GPU memories.

Hybrid Digital-Analog Semantic Communications,"Huiqiang Xie, Zhijin Qin, Zhu Han, Khaled B. Letaief","Digital and analog semantic communications (SemCom) face inherent limitations such as data security concerns in analog SemCom, as well as leveling-off and cliff-edge effects in digital SemCom. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SemCom framework and a corresponding system called HDA-DeepSC, which leverages a hybrid digital-analog approach for multimedia transmission. This is achieved through the introduction of digital-analog allocation and fusion modules. To strike a balance between data rate and distortion, we design new loss functions that take into account long-distance dependencies in the semantic distortion constraint, essential information recovery in the channel distortion constraint, and optimal bit stream generation in the rate constraint. Additionally, we propose denoising diffusion-based signal detection techniques, which involve carefully designed variance schedules and sampling algorithms to refine transmitted signals. Through extensive numerical experiments, we will demonstrate that HDA-DeepSC exhibits robustness to channel variations and is capable of supporting various communication scenarios.

LPD-Aware Uplink CSI-based 5G NR Downlink Synchronization for Tactical   Networks,"Karthik Upadhya, Akshay Jain, Mikko A. Uusitalo, Harish Viswanathan","5G NR is touted to be an attractive candidate for tactical networks owing to its versatility, scalability, and low cost. However, tactical networks need to be stealthy, where an adversary is not able to detect or intercept the tactical communication. In this paper, we investigate the stealthiness of 5G NR by looking at the probability with which an adversary that monitors the downlink synchronization signals can detect the presence of the network. We simulate a single-cell single-eavesdropper scenario and evaluate the probability with which the eavesdropper can detect the synchronization signal block when using either a correlator or an energy detector. We show that this probability is close to $ 100\% $ suggesting that 5G out-of-the-box is not suitable for a tactical network. We then propose utilizing the uplink channel-state-information to beamform the downlink synchronization-signals towards the tactical user-equipment (UE) to lower the eavesdropper detection probability while not compromising the performance of the legitimate tactical UE.",2024-05-21T11:52:01Z,2024-06-14T10:05:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12704v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12704v2,eess.SP

Near-Field Localization with RIS via Two-Dimensional Signal Path   Classification,"Jeongwan Kang, Seung-Woo Ko, Sunwoo Kim","In this paper, we propose two-dimensional signal path classification (2D-SPC) for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted near-field (NF) localization. In the NF regime, multiple RIS-driven signal paths (SPs) can contribute to precise localization if these are decomposable and the reflected locations on the RIS are known, referred to as SP decomposition (SPD) and SP labeling (SPL), respectively. To this end, each RIS element modulates the incoming SP's phase by shifting it by one of the values in the phase shift profile (PSP) lists satisfying resolution requirements. By interworking with a conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, the user equipment can construct a 2D spectrum map that couples each SPs time of arrival (ToA) and PSP. Then, we design SPL by mapping SPs with the corresponding reflected RIS elements when they share the same PSP. Given two unlabeled SPs, we derive a geometric discriminant from checking whether the current label is correct. It can be extended to more than three SPs by sorting them using pairwise geometric discriminants between adjacent ones. From simulation results, it has been demonstrated that the proposed 2D SPC achieves consistent localization accuracy even if insufficient PSPs are given.",2024-05-29T02:23:33Z,2024-05-29T02:23:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18701v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18701v1,eess.SP
Bifurcation enhances temporal information encoding in the olfactory   periphery,"Kiri Choi, Will Rosenbluth, Isabella R. Graf, Nirag Kadakia, Thierry Emonet","Living systems continually respond to signals from the surrounding environment. Survival requires that their responses adapt quickly and robustly to the changes in the environment. One particularly challenging example is olfactory navigation in turbulent plumes, where animals experience highly intermittent odor signals while odor concentration varies over many length- and timescales. Here, we show theoretically that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) can exploit proximity to a bifurcation point of their firing dynamics to reliably extract information about the timing and intensity of fluctuations in the odor signal, which have been shown to be critical for odor-guided navigation. Close to the bifurcation, the system is intrinsically invariant to signal variance, and information about the timing, duration, and intensity of odor fluctuations is transferred efficiently. Importantly, we find that proximity to the bifurcation is maintained by mean adaptation alone and therefore does not require any additional feedback mechanism or fine-tuning. Using a biophysical model with calcium-based feedback, we demonstrate that this mechanism can explain the measured adaptation characteristics of Drosophila ORNs.",2024-05-30T15:12:07Z,2024-10-06T20:18:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20135v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20135v3,q-bio.NC

We note that the conventional fully connected true-time delay (TTD)-based architecture is impractical because there is no room for the required large number of analog signal combiners in the circuit board. Additionally, analog signal combiners incur significant signal power loss. These limitations are often overlooked in sub-THz research. To overcome these issues, we study a non-overlapping subarray architecture that eliminates the need for analog combiners. We extend the conventional single-user assumption by formulating an optimization problem to maximize the minimum data rate for simultaneously served users. This complex optimization problem is divided into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem aims to ensure a fair subarray allocation for all users and is solved via a continuous domain relaxation technique. The second sub-problem deals with practical TTD device constraints on range and resolution to maximize the subarray gain and is resolved by shifting to the phase domain.

Spatially constrained vs. unconstrained filtering in neural   spatiospectral filters for multichannel speech enhancement,"Annika Briegleb, Walter Kellermann","When using artificial neural networks for multichannel speech enhancement, filtering is often achieved by estimating a complex-valued mask that is applied to all or one reference channel of the input signal. The estimation of this mask is based on the noisy multichannel signal and, hence, can exploit spatial and spectral cues simultaneously. While it has been shown that exploiting spatial and spectral cues jointly is beneficial for the speech enhancement result, the mechanics of the interplay of the two inside the neural network are still largely unknown. In this contribution, we investigate how two conceptually different neural spatiospectral filters (NSSFs) exploit spatial cues depending on the training target signal and show that, while one NSSF always performs spatial filtering, the other one is selective in leveraging spatial information depending on the task at hand. These insights provide better understanding of the information the NSSFs use to make their prediction and, thus, allow to make informed decisions regarding their design and deployment.",2024-06-17T09:52:41Z,2024-06-17T09:52:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11376v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11376v1,eess.AS

Increased spatial diversity in CFmMIMO is achieved by spreading the antennas into small access points (APs), which cooperate to serve the users. Sequential fronthaul topologies in CFmMIMO, such as the daisy chain and multi-branch tree topology, have gained considerable attention recently. In such a processing architecture, each AP must store its received signal vector in the memory until it receives the relevant information from the previous AP in the sequence to refine the estimate of the users' signal vector in the uplink. In this paper, we adopt vector-wise and element-wise compression on the raw or pre-processed received signal vectors to store them in the memory. We investigate the impact of the limited memory capacity in the APs on the optimal number of APs. We show that with no memory constraint, having single-antenna APs is optimal, especially as the number of users grows.

"Harmonic fractal transformation, 4R-regeneration and noise shaping for   ultra wide-band reception in FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal model",Mariia Sorokina,"Human hearing range significantly surpasses the typical neuronal spiking frequency. Yet, neurons with their modest frequency range not only efficiently receive and process multiple orders higher frequency signals, but also demonstrate remarkable stability and adaptability to frequency variations in brain functional connectivity. Ability to process signals beyond the limitations of the receiver temporal or frequency (bandwidth) resolution is highly desirable yet requires complex design architectures. Using the FitzHugh-Nagumo model we reveal the harmonic fractal transformation of frequency and bandwidth, which enables the Nyquist rate integer (for low frequencies) and sub-integer (for high frequencies) multiplication. We also demonstrate for the first time that noise shaping can be achieved in a simple RLC-circuit without a requirement of a delay line. The discovered effect presents a novel regeneration type - 4R: re-amplifying, re-shaping, re-timing, and re-modulating and due to the fractal nature of transformation offers a remarkable regenerative efficiency. The effect is a generalization of phase locking to non-periodic encoded signals.

Achieving Practical OAM Based Wireless Communications With Misaligned   Transceiver,"Wenchi Cheng, Haiyue Jing, Wei Zhang, Zan Li, Hailin Zhang","Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has attracted much attention for radio vortex wireless communications due to the orthogonality among different OAM-modes. To maintain the orthogonality among different OAM modes at the receiver, the strict alignment between transmit and receive antennas is highly demanded. However, it is not practical to guarantee the transceiver alignment in wireless communications. The phase turbulence, resulting from the misaligned transceivers, leads to serious inter-mode interference among different OAM modes and therefore fail for signals detection of multiple OAM modes at the receiver. To achieve practical OAM based wireless communications, in this paper we investigate the radio vortex wireless communications with misaligned transmit and receive antennas. We propose a joint Beamforming and Pre-detection (BePre) scheme, which uses two unitary matrices to convert the channel matrix into the equivalent circulant matrix for keeping the orthogonality among OAM-modes at the receiver. Then, the OAM signals can be detected with the mode-decomposition scheme at the misaligned receiver.

Furthermore, traditional energy-based detectors are inherently susceptible to a notable error floor issue, attributed to the co-channel direct link interference (DLI). Consequently, this paper proposes a blind symbol detector without the prior knowledge of the channel state information, signal variance, and noise variance.

Efficient Dual-Blind Deconvolution for Joint Radar-Communication Systems   Using ADMM: Enhancing Channel Estimation and Signal Recovery in 5G mmWave   Networks,"Anis Hamadouche, Mathini Sellathurai","This paper introduces a novel framework for jointly estimating unknown radar channels and transmit signals in millimeter-wave (mmWave) Joint Radar-Communication (JRC) systems, a problem often referred to as dual-blind deconvolution. The proposed method employs the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to iteratively refine the radar channel G (or H) and the transmitted signal X under convex constraints, incorporating both smooth and non-smooth penalty terms via proximal operators. By enforcing a bounded perturbation model for the radar channel and a strict transmit power budget, the algorithm aligns well with practical hardware limits. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach reliably addresses the dual-blind deconvolution challenge, resulting in effective radar channel estimation and robust communication performance. Notably, the framework's iterative structure readily accommodates hardware considerations and different system configurations, making it well-suited for emerging mmWave JRC scenarios.

Beamforming with Oversampled Time-Modulated Arrays,"Marcin Wachowiak, Andr√© Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin","The time-modulated array (TMA) is a simple array architecture in which each antenna is connected via a multi-throw switch. The switch acts as a modulator switching state faster than the symbol rate. The phase shifting and beamforming is achieved by a cyclic shift of the periodical modulating signal across antennas. In this paper, the TMA mode of operation is proposed to improve the resolution of a conventional phase shifter. The TMAs are analyzed under constrained switching frequency being a small multiple of the symbol rate. The presented generic signal model gives insight into the magnitude, phase and spacing of the harmonic components generated by the quantized modulating sequence. It is shown that the effective phase-shifting resolution can be improved multiplicatively by the oversampling factor ($O$) at the cost of introducing harmonics. Finally, the array tapering with an oversampled modulating signal is proposed. The oversampling provides $O+1$ uniformly distributed tapering amplitudes.",2025-01-30T19:12:45Z,2025-02-12T11:29:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18709v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18709v2,eess.SP
Simultaneous Beamforming and Anti-Jamming With Intelligent Omni-Surfaces,"Yuhan Wang, Shuhao Zeng, Qingyu Liu, Boya Di, Hongliang Zhang","Wireless transmission is vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks due to the openness of wireless channels, posing a severe threat to wireless communications. Current anti-jamming studies primarily focus on either enhancing desired signals or mitigating jamming, resulting in limited performance. To address this issue, intelligent omni-surface (IOS) is a promising solution. By jointly designing its reflective and refractive properties, the IOS can simultaneously nullify jamming and enhance desired signals. In this paper, we consider an IOS-aided multi-user anti-jamming communication system, aiming to improve desired signals and nullify jamming by optimizing IOS phase shifts and transmit beamforming. However, this is challenging due to the coupled and discrete IOS reflection and refraction phase shifts, the unknown jammer's beamformer, and imperfect jammer-related channel state information. To tackle this, we relax IOS phase shifts to continuous states and optimize with a coupling-aware algorithm using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and S-procedure, followed by a local search to recover discrete states. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the sum rate amid jamming attacks.",2025-02-04T06:43:08Z,2025-02-04T06:43:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02055v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02055v1,eess.SP

Towards THz-based Obstacle Sensing: A Generative Radio Environment   Awareness Framework,"Tianyu Hu, Yunhang Xie, Shuai Wang, Boyu Ning, Lingxiang Li, Zhi Chen","Obstacle sensing is essential for terahertz (THz) communication since the subsequent beam management can avoid THz signals blocked by the obstacles. In parallel, radio environment, which can be manifested by channel knowledge such as the distribution of received signal strength (RSS), reveals signal propagation situation and the corresponding obstacle information. However, the awareness of the radio environment for obstacle sensing is challenging in practice, as the sparsely deployed THz sensors can acquire only little a priori knowledge with their RSS measurements. Therefore, we formulate in this paper a radio environment awareness problem, which for the first time considers a probability distribution of obstacle attributes. To solve such a problem, we propose a THz-based generative radio environment awareness framework, in which obstacle information is obtained directly from the aware radio environment. We also propose a novel generative model based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), where U-net and the objective function of the problem are introduced to enable accurate awareness of RSS distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can improve the awareness of the radio environment, and thus achieve superior sensing performance in terms of average precision regarding obstacles' shape and location.",2025-02-11T12:12:46Z,2025-02-11T12:12:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07504v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07504v1,eess.SP

Non-negative tensor factorization-based dependence map analysis for   local damage detection in presence of non-Gaussian noise,"Anna Michalak, Justyna Hebda-Sobkowicz, Anil Kumar, Radoslaw Zimroz, Rafal Zdunek, Agnieszka Wylomanska","The time-frequency map (TFM) is frequently used in condition monitoring, necessitating further processing to select an informative frequency band (IFB) or directly detect damage. However, selecting an IFB is challenging due to the complexity of spectral structures, non-Gaussian disturbances, and overlapping fault signatures in vibration signals. Additionally, dynamic operating conditions and low signal-to-noise ratio further complicate the identification of relevant features that indicate damage. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a novel method for informative band selection and local damage detection in rolling element bearings, utilizing non-negative tensor factorization (NTF)-based dependence map analysis. The recently introduced concept of the dependence map is leveraged, with a set of these maps being factorized to separate informative components from non-informative ones. Dependence maps provide valuable information on the auto-similarity of spectral content, while NTF, a powerful tool commonly used in image processing for feature extraction, enhances this process. The combination of these methods allows for the extraction of IFBs, forming the basis for local damage detection.

5G Direct Position Estimation for Precise Localization in Dense Urban   Area,"Sijia Li, Sergio Vicenzo, Bing Xu","In recent years, the fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals have emerged as a promising supplementary resource for urban navigation. However, a major challenge in utilizing 5G signals lies in their vulnerability to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation effects, which are especially prevalent in urban street canyons. This paper applies the direct position estimation (DPE) method to 5G cellular signals to mitigate the NLoS bias as well as the multipath effects, thereby enabling precise localization in urbanized environments. The feasibility of applying the DPE method to NR positioning is analyzed, followed by a discussion of the tapped delay line (TDL) channel propagation model provided by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The positioning performance is then evaluated through large-scale system-level simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that 5G DPE achieves satisfactory positioning accuracy in a 10 dB noisy channel, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) constrained within 6 m. In addition, 5G DPE outperforms the observed time difference of arrival (OTDoA) method by 95.24% in terms of positioning accuracy in an NLoS-dominated propagation environment.",2025-02-25T06:02:47Z,2025-02-25T06:02:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17875v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17875v1,eess.SP
The statistical mechanics of complex signaling networks : nerve growth   factor signaling,"Kevin S. Brown, Colin C. Hill, Guillermo A. Calero, Kelvin H. Lee, James P. Sethna, Richard A. Cerione","It is becoming increasingly appreciated that the signal transduction systems used by eukaryotic cells to achieve a variety of essential responses represent highly complex networks rather than simple linear pathways. While significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these signaling networks, many of the parameters required to describe the behavior of these systems remain unknown, or at best, estimates. With these goals and caveats in mind, we use methods of statistical mechanics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling networks. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods towards modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. Using our approach, we are able to extract predictions that are highly specific and accurate, thereby enabling us to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. We show that extracting biologically relevant predictions from complex signaling models appears to be possible even in the absence of measurements of all the individual rate constants. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems wherein particular ''soft'' combinations of parameters can be varied over wide ranges without impacting the final output and demonstrating that a few ''stiff'' parameter combinations center around the paramount regulatory steps of the network.

Multimodal encoding in a simplified model of intracellular calcium   signaling,"Maurizio De Pitta`, Vladislav Volman, Herbert Levine, Eshel Ben-Jacob","Many cells use calcium signalling to carry information from the extracellular side of the plasma membrane to targets in their interior. Since virtually all cells employ a network of biochemical reactions for Ca2+ signalling, much effort has been devoted to understand the functional role of Ca2+ responses and to decipher how their complex dynamics is regulated by the biochemical network of Ca2+-related signal transduction pathways. Experimental observations show that Ca2+ signals in response to external stimuli encode information via frequency modulation or alternatively via amplitude modulation. Although minimal models can capture separately both types of dynamics, they fail to exhibit different and more advanced encoding modes. By arguments of bifurcation theory, we propose instead that under some biophysical conditions more complex modes of information encoding can also be manifested by minimal models. We consider the minimal model of Li and Rinzel and show that information encoding can occur by amplitude modulation (AM) of Ca2+ oscillations, by frequency modulation (FM) or by both modes (AFM). Our work is motivated by calcium signalling in astrocytes, the predominant type of cortical glial cells that is nowadays recognized to play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal activity and information processing of the brain. We explain that our results can be crucial for a better understanding of synaptic information transfer. Furthermore, our results might also be important for better insight on other examples of physiological processes regulated by Ca2+ signalling.",2009-12-16T07:24:50Z,2009-12-16T07:24:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3064v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.3064v1,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.SC"
Ca2+ release via IP3 receptors shapes the cytosolic Ca2+ transient for   hypertrophic signalling in ventricular cardiomyocytes,"Hilary Hunt, Agne Tilunaite, Greg Bass, Christian Soeller, H. Llewelyn Roderick, Vijay Rajagopal, Edmund J. Crampin","Calcium (Ca2+) plays a central role in mediating both contractile function and hypertrophic signalling in ventricular cardiomyocytes. L-type Ca2+ channels trigger release of Ca2+ from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) for cellular contraction, while signalling downstream of Gq coupled receptors stimulates Ca2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), engaging hypertrophic signalling pathways. Modulation of the amplitude, duration, and duty cycle of the cytosolic Ca2+ contraction signal, and spatial localisation, have all been proposed to encode this hypertrophic signal. Given current knowledge of IP3Rs, we develop a model describing the effect of functional interaction (cross-talk) between RyR and IP3R channels on the Ca2+ transient, and examine the sensitivity of the Ca2+ transient shape to properties of IP3R activation. A key result of our study is that IP3R activation increases Ca2+ transient duration for a broad range of IP3R properties, but the effect of IP3R activation on Ca2+ transient amplitude is dependent on IP3 concentration. Furthermore we demonstrate that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in the cytosol increases the duty cycle of the Ca2+ transient, the fraction of the cycle for which [Ca2+] is elevated, across a broad range of parameter values and IP3 concentrations. When coupled to a model of downstream transcription factor (NFAT) activation, we demonstrate that there is a high correspondence between the Ca transient duty cycle and the proportion of activated NFAT in the nucleus. These findings suggest increased cytosolic Ca2+ duty cycle as a plausible mechanism for IP3-dependent hypertrophic signalling via Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors such as NFAT in ventricular cardiomyocytes.",2019-02-13T10:51:18Z,2020-08-17T06:30:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04851v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04851v4,q-bio.SC
"Joint Radar and Communication Design: Applications, State-of-the-art,   and the Road Ahead","Fan Liu, Christos Masouros, Athina Petropulu, Hugh Griffiths, Lajos Hanzo","In this paper, we firstly overview the application scenarios and the research progress in the area of communication and radar spectrum sharing (CRSS). We then propose a novel transceiver architecture and frame structure for a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) base station (BS) operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, using the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) beamforming technique. We assume that the BS is serving a multi-antenna aided user equipment (UE) operating in a mmWave channel, which in the meantime actively detects multiple targets. Note that part of the targets also play the role of scatterers for the communication signal. Given this framework, we propose a novel scheme for joint target search and communication channel estimation relying on the omni-directional pilot signals generated by the HAD structure. Given a fully-digital communication precoder and a desired radar transmit beampattern, we propose to design the analog and digital precoders under non-convex constant-modulus (CM) and power constraints, such that the BS can formulate narrow beams towards all the targets, while pre-equalizing the impact of the communication channel. Furthermore, we design an HAD receiver that can simultaneously process signals from the UE and echo waves from the targets. By tracking the angular variation of the targets, we show that it is possible to recover the target echoes and mitigate the potential interference imposed on the UE signals by invoking the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique, even when the radar and communication signals share the equivalent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed approaches in realizing DFRC are verified via numerical simulations.

Stationarity of Time-Series on Graph via Bivariate Translation   Invariance,"Amin Jalili, Chong-Yung Chi","Stationarity is a cornerstone in classical signal processing (CSP) for modeling and characterizing various stochastic signals for the ensuing analysis. However, in many complex real world scenarios, where the stochastic process lies over an irregular graph structure, CSP discards the underlying structure in analyzing such structured data. Then it is essential to establish a new framework to analyze the high-dimensional graph structured stochastic signals by taking the underlying structure into account. To this end, looking through the lens of operator theory, we first propose a new bivariate isometric joint translation operator (JTO) consistent with the structural characteristic of translation operators in other signal domains. Moreover, we characterize time-vertex filtering based on the proposed JTO. Thereupon, we put forth a new definition of joint wide-sense stationary (JWSS) signals in time-vertex domain using the proposed isometric JTO together with its spectral characterization. Then a new joint power spectral density (JPSD) estimator, called generalized Welch method (GWM), is presented. Simulation results are provided to show the efficacy of this JPSD estimator. Furthermore, to show the usefulness of JWSS modeling, we focus on the classification of time-series on graph. To that end, by modeling the brain Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as JWSS processes, we use JPSD as the feature for the Emotion and Alzheimer's disease (AD) recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that JPSD yields superior Emotion and AD recognition accuracy in comparison with the classical power spectral density (PSD) and graph PSD (GPSD) as the feature set for both applications.

Deconvolution of the Functional Ultrasound Response in the Mouse Visual   Pathway Using Block-Term Decomposition,"Aybuke Erol, Chagajeg Soloukey, Bastian Generowicz, Nikki Van Dorp, Sebastiaan Koekkoek, Pieter Kruizinga, Borbala Hunyadi","Functional ultrasound (fUS) indirectly measures brain activity by recording changes in cerebral blood volume and flow in response to neural activation. Conventional approaches model such functional neuroimaging data as the convolution between an impulse response, known as the hemodynamic response function (HRF), and a binarized representation of the input (i.e., source) signal based on the stimulus onsets, the so-called experimental paradigm (EP). However, the EP may not be enough to characterize the whole complexity of the underlying source signals that evoke the hemodynamic changes, such as in the case of spontaneous resting state activity. Furthermore, the HRF varies across brain areas and stimuli. To achieve an adaptable framework that can capture such dynamics and unknowns of the brain function, we propose a deconvolution method for multivariate fUS time-series that reveals both the region-specific HRFs, and the source signals that induce the hemodynamic responses in the studied regions. We start by modeling the fUS time-series as convolutive mixtures and use a tensor-based approach for deconvolution based on two assumptions: (1) HRFs are parametrizable, and (2) source signals are uncorrelated. We test our approach on fUS data acquired during a visual experiment on a mouse subject, focusing on three regions within the mouse brain's colliculo-cortical, image-forming pathway: the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus and visual cortex. The estimated HRFs in each region are in agreement with prior works, whereas the estimated source signal is observed to closely follow the EP. Yet, we note a few deviations from the EP in the estimated source signal that most likely arise due to the trial-by-trial variability of the neural response across different repetitions of the stimulus observed in the selected regions.",2022-04-07T19:41:32Z,2022-05-25T12:52:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03711v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03711v2,"eess.SP, q-bio.NC"
Differential Data-Aided Beam Training for RIS-Empowered Multi-Antenna   Communications,"Kun Chen-Hu, George C. Alexandropoulos, Ana Garc√≠a Armada","The Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) constitutes one of the prominent technologies for the next generation of wireless communications. It is envisioned to enhance the signal coverage in cases when the direct link of the communication is weak. Recently, beam training based on codebook selection is proposed to obtain the optimized phase configuration of the RIS. After that, the data is transmitted and received by using the classical coherent demodulation scheme (CDS). This training approach is able to avoid the large overhead required by the channel sounding process, and it also circumvents complex optimization problems. However, the beam training still requires the transmission of some reference signals to test the different phase configurations of the codebook, and the best codeword is chosen according to the measurement of the received energy of the reference signals. Then, the overhead due to the transmission of reference signals reduces the spectral efficiency. In this paper, a zero overhead beam training for RIS is proposed, relying on data transmission and reception based on non-CDS (NCDS). At the BS, the received differential data can also be used for the determination of the best beam for the RIS. Therefore, the efficiency of the system is significantly enhanced since reference signals are fully avoided. After choosing the best codebook, NCDS is still more suitable to transmit information for high mobility scenarios as compared to the classical CDS. Analytical expressions for the Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) for the non-coherent RIS-empowered system are presented. Moreover, a detailed comparison between the NCDS and CDS in terms of efficiency and complexity is also given. The extensive computer simulation results verify the accuracy of the presented analysis and showcase that the proposed system outperforms the existing solutions.",2022-04-27T16:16:36Z,2022-10-28T18:11:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13029v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13029v3,eess.SP
Maximum Lyapunov exponent revisited: Long-term attractor divergence of   gait dynamics is highly sensitive to the noise structure of stride intervals,"Philippe Terrier, Fabienne Reynard","The local dynamic stability method (maximum Lyapunov exponent) can assess gait stability. Two variants of the method exist: the short-term divergence exponent (DE), and the long-term DE. Only the short-term DE can predict fall risk. The significance of long-term DE has been unclear so far. Some studies have suggested that the complex, fractal-like structure of fluctuations among consecutive strides correlates with long-term DE. The aim, therefore, was to assess whether the long-term DE is a gait complexity index. The study reanalyzed a dataset of trunk accelerations from 100 healthy adults walking at preferred speed on a treadmill for 10 minutes. By interpolation, the stride intervals were modified within the acceleration signals for the purpose of conserving the original shape of the signal, while imposing a known stride-to-stride fluctuation structure. 4 types of hybrid signals with different noise structures were built: constant, anti-correlated, random, and correlated (fractal). Short- and long-term DEs were then computed. The results show that long-term DEs, but not short-term DEs, are sensitive to the noise structure of stride intervals. It was that observed that random hybrid signals exhibited significantly lower long-term DEs than hybrid correlated signals did (0.100 vs 0.144, i.e. a 44% difference). Long-term DEs from constant hybrid signals were close to zero (0.006). Short-term DEs of anti-correlated, random, and correlated hybrid signals were closely grouped (2.49, 2.50, and 2.51). The short- and long-term DEs, although they are both computed from divergence curves, should not be interpreted in a similar way. The long-term DE is very likely an index of gait complexity, which may be associated with gait automaticity or cautiousness. To better differentiate between short- and long-term DEs, the use of the term attractor complexity index (ACI) is proposed for the latter.",2018-02-09T12:18:22Z,2018-02-09T12:18:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03223v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03223v1,q-bio.QM
Deep learning for the detection of machining vibration chatter,"Cheick Abdoul Kadir A. Kounta, Lionel Arnaud, Bernard Kamsu-Foguem, Fana Tangara","Most of the work on chatter detection is based on laboratory machining tests, thus without the constraints of noise, the variety of situations to be managed in the industry, and the uncertainties on the parameters (sensor position, tool engagement, and sometimes even spindle rotation frequency). This work presents an approach first based on mechanical skills first to identify the optimal signal processing, then based on deep learning to automatically detect the phenomenon of chatter in machining. To do so, we use input images from the Fast Fourier Transform analysis of a vibration signal from the machining of an Alstom industrial railway system. The FFT images are first cropped in height to perform a renormalization of the signal scale. This renormalization step eliminates a bias regularly observed in the literature, which did not eliminate a simple correlation with signal amplitude because chatter is often, but not always, associated with stronger vibrations. Deep learning extracted features from the image data by exploiting pre-trained deep neural networks such as VGG16 and ResNet50. The data is derived from an industrial vibration signal (with noise, a not ideally placed sensors, and uncertainties on process parameters), which was very poorly represented in the literature. It is shown that by depleting the signal (renormalized amplitude and absence of information on the rotation speed), the model obtains a good result (an accuracy of 99% in the training and validation phases), which had never been done in the literature. In addition, since a part of the test dataset is similar to the training dataset, the proposed model obtains an accuracy of 98.82%. The robustness is proved by adding another test dataset containing noisy and more or less ambiguous images to be classified. The model still manages to detect these cases from its training of unambiguous cases, showing that the obtained generalization is efficient with an accuracy of 73.71%.",2023-03-17T07:59:25Z,2023-03-17T07:59:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11430v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11430v1,eess.SP
NRC-Net: Automated noise robust cardio net for detecting valvular   cardiac diseases using optimum transformation method with heart sound signals,"Samiul Based Shuvo, Syed Samiul Alam, Syeda Umme Ayman, Arbil Chakma, Prabal Datta Barua, U Rajendra Acharya","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) can be effectively treated when detected early, reducing mortality rates significantly. Traditionally, phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have been utilized for detecting cardiovascular disease due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity. Nevertheless, various environmental and physiological noises frequently affect the PCG signals, compromising their essential distinctive characteristics. The prevalence of this issue in overcrowded and resource-constrained hospitals can compromise the accuracy of medical diagnoses. Therefore, this study aims to discover the optimal transformation method for detecting CVDs using noisy heart sound signals and propose a noise robust network to improve the CVDs classification performance.For the identification of the optimal transformation method for noisy heart sound data mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), short-time Fourier transform (STFT), constant-Q nonstationary Gabor transform (CQT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has been used with VGG16. Furthermore, we propose a novel convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture called noise robust cardio net (NRC-Net), which is a lightweight model to classify mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, and normal heart sounds using PCG signals contaminated with respiratory and random noises.

A Radiological Clip Design Using Ultrasound Identification to Improve   Localization,"Jenna Cario, Zhengchang Kou, Rita J. Miller, April Dickenson, Christine U. Lee, Michael L. Oelze","Objective: We demonstrate the use of ultrasound to receive an acoustic signal transmitted from a radiological clip designed from a custom circuit. This signal encodes an identification number and is localized and identified wirelessly by the ultrasound imaging system. Methods: We designed and constructed the test platform with a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller core to detect ultrasonic imaging pulses received by a transducer embedded in a phantom, which acted as the radiological clip. Ultrasound identification (USID) signals were generated and transmitted as a result. The phantom and clip were imaged using an ultrasonic array (Philips L7-4) connected to a Verasonics Vantage 128 system operating in pulse inversion (PI) mode. Cross-correlations were performed to localize and identify the code sequences in the PI images. Results: USID signals were detected and visualized on B-mode images of the phantoms with up to sub-millimeter localization accuracy. The average detection rate across 4,800 frames of ultrasound data was 93.0%. Tested ID values exhibited differences in detection rates. Conclusion: The USID clip produced identifiable, distinguishable, and localizable signals when imaged. Significance: Radiological clips are used to mark breast cancer being treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) via implant in or near treated lesions. As NAC progresses, available marking clips can lose visibility in ultrasound, the imaging modality of choice for monitoring NAC-treated lesions. By transmitting an active signal, more accurate and reliable ultrasound localization of these clips could be achieved and multiple clips with different ID values could be imaged in the same field of view.",2023-08-30T20:53:27Z,2024-02-01T22:35:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16319v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16319v2,eess.SP
Complexity reduction by symmetry: uncovering the minimal regulatory   network for logical computation in bacteria,"Luis A. √Ålvarez-Garc√≠a, Wolfram Liebermeister, Ian Leifer, Hern√°n A. Makse","Symmetry principles play an important role in geometry, and physics, allowing for the reduction of complicated systems to simpler, more comprehensible models that preserve the system's features of interest. Biological systems are often highly complex and may consist of a large number of interacting parts. Using symmetry fibrations, the relevant symmetries for biological ""message-passing"" networks, we introduce a scheme, called Complexity Reduction by Symmetry or ComSym, to reduce the gene regulatory networks of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria to core networks in a way that preserves the dynamics and uncovers the computational capabilities of the network. Gene nodes in the original network that share isomorphic input trees are collapsed by the fibration into equivalence classes called fibers, whereby nodes that receive signals with the same ""history"" belong to one fiber and synchronize. Then we reduce the networks to its minimal computational core via k-core decomposition. This computational core consists of a few strongly connected components or ""signal vortices"", in which signals can cycle through. While between them, these ""signal vortices"" transmit signals in a feedforward manner. These connected components perform signal processing and decision making in the bacterial cell by employing a series of genetic toggle-switch circuits that store memory, plus oscillator circuits. These circuits act as the central computation device of the network, whose output signals then spread to the rest of the network. Our reduction method opens the door to narrow the vast complexity of biological systems to their minimal parts in a systematic way by using fundamental theoretical principles of symmetry.",2023-10-17T00:05:01Z,2025-02-25T02:08:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10895v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10895v3,"q-bio.CB, q-bio.MN"
On the Accuracy of Phase Extraction from a Known-Frequency Noisy   Sinusoidal Signal,"Emmanuel Dervieux, Florian Tilquin, Alexis Bisiaux, Wilfried Uhring","Accurate phase extraction from sinusoidal signals is a crucial task in various signal processing applications. While prior research predominantly addresses the case of asynchronous sampling with unknown signal frequency, this study focuses on the more specific situation where synchronous sampling is possible, and the signal's frequency is known. In this framework, a comprehensive analysis of phase estimation accuracy in the presence of both additive and phase noises is presented. A closed-form expression for the asymptotic Probability Density Function (PDF) of the resulting phase estimator is validated by simulations depicting Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) trends in different noise scenarios. This estimator is asymptotically efficient, converging rapidly to its Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Three distinct RMSE behaviours were identified based on SNR, sample count (N), and noise level: (i) saturation towards a random guess at low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) linear decrease with the square roots of N and SNR at moderate noise levels, and (iii) saturation at high SNR towards a noise floor dependent on the phase noise level. By quantifying the impact of sample count, additive noise, and phase noise on phase estimation accuracy, this work provides valuable insights for designing systems requiring precise phase extraction, such as phase-based fluorescence assays or system identification.",2024-02-06T12:09:04Z,2024-10-31T14:52:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03935v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03935v5,eess.SP

Among noninvasive interfaces, surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals have shown particular utility. However, much remains unknown about how sEMG is affected by various physiological and anatomical factors and how these confounds might affect gesture decoding across individuals or groups. In this article, we show that sEMG signals evince non-Euclidean graph data structure that is defined by a set of orthogonal axes and explain the signal distribution shift across individuals. We provide a dataset of upper limb sEMG signals and physiological measures of 91 adults as they perform 10 different hand gestures. Participants were selected to be representative of various age groups (18to 92 years) and BMI (healthy, overweight, and obese). Additional anatomical or physiological measures that might impact sEMG signals were also collected, such as skin hydration and elasticity. The article describes the inherent structure of sEMG data and provides methods to construct differentiable signal features that can be used with machine learning algorithms that use backpropagation. We then analyze how those parameters correlate with various physiological measures to probe if they can induce bias against (or towards) certain population groups. We find that higher frequencies in sEMG, although comprising less power than lower ones, provide better gesture decoding and show less bias with regard to demographic, circumstantial, and physiological confounds (such as age, skin hydration, and skin elasticity).",2024-09-30T04:31:34Z,2024-10-19T18:17:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19939v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19939v2,eess.SP
Early warning signals: The charted and uncharted territories,"Carl Boettiger, Noam Ross, Alan Hastings","The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of 'critical slowing down' that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down, (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system; bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others, and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise.",2013-05-29T06:00:23Z,2013-05-29T06:00:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6700v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6700v1,"q-bio.PE, q-bio.QM"
Dual-target function validation of single-particle selection from   low-contrast cryo-electron micrographs,"Youdong Mao, Luis R. Castillo-Menendez, Joseph Sodroski","Weak-signal detection and single-particle selection from low-contrast micrographs of frozen hydrated biomolecules by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) presents a practical challenge. Cryo-EM image contrast degrades as the size of biomolecules of structural interest decreases. When the image contrast falls into a range where the location or presence of single particles becomes ambiguous, a need arises for objective computational approaches to detect weak signal and to select and verify particles from these low-contrast micrographs. Here we propose an objective validation scheme for low-contrast particle selection using a combination of two different target functions. In an implementation of this dual-target function (DTF) validation, a first target function of fast local correlation was used to select particles through template matching, followed by signal validation through a second target function of maximum likelihood. By a systematic study of simulated data, we found that such an implementation of DTF validation is capable of selecting and verifying particles from cryo-EM micrographs with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 0.002. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTF validation can robustly evade over-fitting or reference bias from the particle-picking template, allowing true signal to emerge from amidst heavy noise in an objective fashion. The DTF approach allows efficient assembly of a large number of single-particle cryo-EM images of smaller biomolecules or specimens containing contrast-degrading agents like detergents in a semi-automatic manner.",2013-09-10T19:19:48Z,2013-09-10T19:19:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2618v1,q-bio.QM
Signalling Entropy: a novel network-theoretical framework for systems   analysis and interpretation of functional omic data,"Andrew Teschendorff, Peter Sollich, Reimer Kuehn","A key challenge in systems biology is the elucidation of the underlying principles, or fundamental laws, which determine the cellular phenotype. Understanding how these fundamental principles are altered in diseases like cancer is important for translating basic scientific knowledge into clinical advances. While significant progress is being made, with the identification of novel drug targets and treatments by means of systems biological methods, our fundamental systems level understanding of why certain treatments succeed and others fail is still lacking. We here advocate a novel methodological framework for systems analysis and interpretation of molecular omic data, which is based on statistical mechanical principles. Specifically, we propose the notion of cellular signalling entropy (or uncertainty), as a novel means of analysing and interpreting omic data, and more fundamentally, as a means of elucidating systems-level principles underlying basic biology and disease. We describe the power of signalling entropy to discriminate cells according to differentiation potential and cancer status. We further argue the case for an empirical cellular entropy-robustness correlation theorem and demonstrate its existence in cancer cell line drug sensitivity data. Specifically, we find that high signalling entropy correlates with drug resistance and further describe how entropy could be used to identify the achilles heels of cancer cells. In summary, signalling entropy is a deep and powerful concept, based on rigorous statistical mechanical principles, which, with improved data quality and coverage, will allow a much deeper understanding of the systems biological principles underlying normal and disease physiology.",2014-08-05T15:25:02Z,2014-08-05T15:25:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1002v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.1002v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.GN"
Detecting single-trial EEG evoked potential using a wavelet domain   linear mixed model: application to error potentials classification,"J Spinnato, M-C Roubaud, B Burle, B Torr√©sani","Objective. The main goal of this work is to develop a model for multi-sensor signals such as MEG or EEG signals, that accounts for the inter-trial variability, suitable for corresponding binary classification problems. An important constraint is that the model be simple enough to handle small size and unbalanced datasets, as often encountered in BCI type experiments. Approach. The method involves linear mixed effects statistical model, wavelet transform and spatial filtering, and aims at the characterization of localized discriminant features in multi-sensor signals. After discrete wavelet transform and spatial filtering, a projection onto the relevant wavelet and spatial channels subspaces is used for dimension reduction. The projected signals are then decomposed as the sum of a signal of interest (i.e. discriminant) and background noise, using a very simple Gaussian linear mixed model. Main results. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, the corresponding parameter estimation problem is simplified. Robust estimates of class-covariance matrices are obtained from small sample sizes and an effective Bayes plug-in classifier is derived. The approach is applied to the detection of error potentials in multichannel EEG data, in a very unbalanced situation (detection of rare events). Classification results prove the relevance of the proposed approach in such a context. Significance. The combination of linear mixed model, wavelet transform and spatial filtering for EEG classification is, to the best of our knowledge, an original approach, which is proven to be effective.

We found that the de facto quality-metric for task-free fMRI, temporal signal to noise ratio (tSNR), correlated inversely with dynamic fidelity; thus, studies optimized for tSNR actually produced time-series that showed the greatest distortion of signal dynamics. Instead, the phantom showed that dynamic fidelity is reasonably approximated by a measure that, unlike tSNR, dissociates signal dynamics from scanner artifact. We then tested this measure, signal fluctuation sensitivity (SFS), against human resting-state data.

Multiple reasons such as lack of diagnostic facilities in the rural health care centers and absence of cardiologists in Emergency Rooms inhibit the timely treatment. In this study, we aimed to develop an effective system to pre-hospital management of Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has been widely used to build BCIs. However, currently developed algorithms do not predict the modulation of SSVEP amplitude, which is known to change as a function of stimulus luminance contrast. In this study, we aim to develop an integrated approach to simultaneously estimate the frequency and contrast-related amplitude modulations of the SSVEP signal. To achieve that, we developed a behavioral task in which human participants focused on a visual flicking target which the luminance contrast can change through time in several ways. SSVEP signals from 16 subjects were then recorded from electrodes placed at the central occipital site using a low-cost, consumer-grade EEG. Our results demonstrate that the filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) performed well in SSVEP frequency recognition, while the support vector regression (SVR) outperformed the other supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting the contrast-dependent amplitude modulations of the SSVEPs. These findings indicate the applicability and strong performance of our integrated method at simultaneously predicting both frequency and amplitude of visually evoked signals, and have proven to be useful for advancing SSVEP-based applications.",2018-09-19T18:09:32Z,2019-12-04T16:57:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07356v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07356v4,eess.SP
Improper Signaling for SISO Two-user Interference Channels with Additive   Asymmetric Hardware Distortion,"Mohammad Soleymani, Christian Lameiro, Ignacio Santamaria, Peter J. Schreier","Hardware non-idealities are among the main performance restrictions for upcoming wireless communication systems. Asymmetric hardware distortions (HWD) happen when the impairments of the I/Q branches are correlated or imbalanced, which in turn generate improper additive interference at the receiver side. When the interference is improper, as well as in other interference-limited scenarios, improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) has been shown to provide rate and/or power efficiency benefits. In this paper, we investigate the rate benefits of IGS in a two-user interference channel (IC) with additive asymmetric HWD when interference is treated as noise. We propose two iterative algorithms to optimize the parameters of the improper transmit signals. We first rewrite the rate region as an pseudosignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (PSINR) region and employ majorization minimization and fractional programming to find a suboptimal solution for the achievable user rates. Then, we propose a simplified algorithm based on a separate optimization of the powers and complementary variances of the users, which exhibits lower computational complexity. We show that IGS can improve the performance of the two-user IC with additive HWD. Our proposed algorithms outperform proper Gaussian signaling and competing IGS algorithms in the literature that do not consider asymmetric HWD.",2019-01-17T14:57:48Z,2019-09-11T15:29:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05821v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05821v3,eess.SP
Joint Beamforming and Dynamic Relay Positioning for mmWave Urban   Communications,"Anastasios Dimas, Dionysios S. Kalogerias, Athina P. Petropulu","The use of millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum for commercial wireless communications is expected to offer data rates in the order of Gigabits-per-second, thus able to support future applications such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication. However, especially in urban settings, mmWave signal propagation is sensitive to blockage by surrounding objects, resulting in significant signal attenuation. One approach to mitigate the effect of attenuation is through multi-hop communication with the help of relays. Leveraging the unique characteristics of the mmWave medium, we consider a single-source/destination $2$-hop system, where a cluster of spatially distributed and reconfigurable relays is used to cooperatively amplify-and-forward the source signal to the destination. Our system evolves in time slots, during which not only are optimal beamforming weights centrally determined, but also future relay positions for the subsequent time slot are optimally selected, jointly maximizing the expected signal-to-interference+noise ratio at the destination. Optimal predictive relay positioning is achieved by formulating a 2-stage stochastic programming problem, which is efficiently approximated via a conditional sample-average-approximation surrogate, and solved in a purely distributed fashion across relays. The efficacy of the proposed near-optimal positioning policy is corroborated by comparison against a randomized relay positioning policy, clearly confirming its superiority.",2019-03-08T22:08:42Z,2020-02-18T22:19:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03682v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03682v2,eess.SP
Exploiting Weak Head Movements for Camera-based Respiration Detection,"Fabian Schrumpf, Christoph Moench, Gerold Bausch, Mirco Fuchs","In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the non-contact based detection of the respiration rate from video sequences. Common techniques either directly assess the movement of the chest due to breathing or are based on analyzing subtle color changes that occur as a result of hemodynamic properties of the skin tissue by means of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). However, extracting hemodynamic parameters from rPPG is often difficult especially if the skin is not visible to the camera. In contrast, extracting respiratory signals from chest movements turned out to be a robust method. However, the detectability of chest regions cannot be guaranteed in any application scenario, for instance if the camera setting is optimized to provide close-up images of the head. In such a case an alternative method for respiration detection is required.   It is reasonable to assume that the mechanical coupling between chest and head induces minor movements of the head which, like in rPPG, can be detected from subtle color changes as well. Although the strength of these movements is expected to be much smaller in scale, sensing these intensity variations could provide a reasonably suited respiration signal for subsequent respiratory rate analysis.   In order to investigate this coupling we conducted an experimental study with 12 subjects and applied motion- and rPPG-based methods to estimate the respiratory frequency from both head regions and chest. Our results show that it is possible to derive signals correlated to chest movement from facial regions. The method is a feasible alternative to rPPG-based respiratory rate estimations when rPPG-signals cannot be derived reliably and chest movement detection cannot be applied as well.",2019-06-19T16:11:53Z,2019-06-19T16:11:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08192v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08192v1,"eess.IV, eess.SP"
Characterizing signal encoding and transmission in class I and class II   neurons via ordinal time-series analysis,"Cristian Estarellas, Maria Masoliver, Cristina Masoller, Claudio Mirasso","Neurons encode and transmit information in spike sequences. However, despite the effort devoted to quantify their information content, little progress has been made in this regard. Here we use a nonlinear method of time-series analysis (known as ordinal analysis) to compare the statistics of spike sequences generated by applying an input signal to the neuronal model of Morris-Lecar. In particular we consider two different regimes for the neurons which lead to two classes of excitability: class I, where the frequency-current curve is continuous and class II, where the frequency-current curve is discontinuous.   By applying ordinal analysis to sequences of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) our goals are (1) to investigate if different neuron types can generate spike sequences which have similar symbolic properties;   (2) to get deeper understanding on the effects that electrical (diffusive) and excitatory chemical (i.e., excitatory synapse) couplings have; and (3) to compare, when a small--amplitude periodic signal is applied to one of the neurons, how the signal features (amplitude and frequency) are encoded and transmitted in the generated ISI sequences for both class I and class II type neurons and electrical or chemical couplings. We find that depending on the frequency, specific combinations of neuron/class and coupling-type allow a more effective encoding, or a more effective transmission of the signal.",2019-08-05T10:23:40Z,2019-08-05T10:23:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01548v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01548v1,q-bio.NC
How Secure are Multicarrier Communication Systems Against Signal   Exploitation Attacks?,"Alireza Nooraiepour, Kenza Hamidouche, Waheed U. Bajwa, Narayan Mandayam","In this paper, robustness of non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) transmissions is investigated and contrasted to OFDM transmissions for fending off signal exploitation attacks. In contrast to ODFM transmissions, NC-OFDM transmissions take place over a subset of active subcarriers to either avoid incumbent transmissions or for strategic considerations. A point-to-point communication system is considered in this paper in the presence of an adversary (exploiter) that aims to infer transmission parameters (e.g., the subset of active subcarriers and duration of the signal) using a deep neural network (DNN). This method has been proposed since the existing methods for exploitation, which are based on cyclostationary analysis, have been shown to have limited success in NC-OFDM systems. A good estimation of the transmission parameters allows the adversary to transmit spurious data and attack the legitimate receiver. Simulation results show that the DNN can infer the transmit parameters of OFDM signals with very good accuracy. However, NC-OFDM with fully random selection of active subcarriers makes it difficult for the adversary to exploit the waveform and thus for the receiver to be affected by the spurious data. Moreover, the more structured the set of active subcarriers selected by the transmitter is, the easier it is for the adversary to infer the transmission parameters and attack the receiver using a DNN.",2018-10-01T05:22:29Z,2018-10-01T05:22:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00532v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00532v1,eess.SP
Domain-Informed Spline Interpolation,"Hamid Behjat, Zafer Doƒüan, Dimitri Van De Ville, Leif S√∂rnmo","Standard interpolation techniques are implicitly based on the assumption that the signal lies on a single homogeneous domain. In contrast, many naturally occurring signals lie on an inhomogeneous domain, such as brain activity associated to different brain tissue. We propose an interpolation method that instead exploits prior information about domain inhomogeneity, characterized by different, potentially overlapping, subdomains. As proof of concept, the focus is put on extending conventional shift-invariant B-spline interpolation. Given a known inhomogeneous domain, B-spline interpolation of a given order is extended to a domain-informed, shift-variant interpolation. This is done by constructing a domain-informed generating basis that satisfies stability properties. We illustrate example constructions of domain-informed generating basis, and show their property in increasing the coherence between the generating basis and the given inhomogeneous domain. By advantageously exploiting domain knowledge, we demonstrate the benefit of domain-informed interpolation over standard B-spline interpolation through Monte Carlo simulations across a range of B-spline orders. We also demonstrate the feasibility of domain-informed interpolation in a neuroimaging application where the domain information is available by a complementary image contrast. The results show the benefit of incorporating domain knowledge so that an interpolant consistent to the anatomy of the brain is obtained.",2018-10-17T12:36:09Z,2019-06-27T11:33:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07502v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07502v3,eess.SP
Estimating information in time-varying signals,"Sarah A Cepeda-Humerez, Jakob Ruess, Ga≈°per Tkaƒçik","Across diverse biological systems -- ranging from neural networks to intracellular signaling and genetic regulatory networks -- the information about changes in the environment is frequently encoded in the full temporal dynamics of the network nodes. A pressing data-analysis challenge has thus been to efficiently estimate the amount of information that these dynamics convey from experimental data. Here we develop and evaluate decoding-based estimation methods to lower bound the mutual information about a finite set of inputs, encoded in single-cell high-dimensional time series data. For biological reaction networks governed by the chemical Master equation, we derive model-based information approximations and analytical upper bounds, against which we benchmark our proposed model-free decoding estimators. In contrast to the frequently-used k-nearest-neighbor estimator, decoding-based estimators robustly extract a large fraction of the available information from high-dimensional trajectories with a realistic number of data samples. We apply these estimators to previously published data on Erk and Ca signaling in mammalian cells and to yeast stress-response, and find that substantial amount of information about environmental state can be encoded by non-trivial response statistics even in stationary signals. We argue that these single-cell, decoding-based information estimates, rather than the commonly-used tests for significant differences between selected population response statistics, provide a proper and unbiased measure for the performance of biological signaling networks.",2018-12-31T16:31:32Z,2018-12-31T16:31:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11884v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11884v1,q-bio.QM
A Machine Learning Based Classification Approach for Power Quality   Disturbances Exploiting Higher Order Statistics in the EMD Domain,"Faeza Hafiz, Celia Shahnaz","The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach for the pattern recognition of power quality (PQ) disturbances based on Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and $k$ Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN) classifier. Since EMD decomposes a signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) in time-domain with same length of the original signal, it preserves the information that is hidden in Fourier domain or in wavelet coefficients. In this proposed method, power signals are decomposed into IMFs in EMD domain. Due to the presence of non-linearity and noise on the original signal, it is hard to analyze them by second order statistics. Thus, an effective feature set is developed considering higher order statistics (HOS) like variance, skewness, and kurtosis from the decomposed first three IMFs. This feature vector is fed into different classifiers like $k$-NN, probabilistic neural network (PNN), and radial basis function (RBF). Among all the classifiers, $k$-NN showed higher classification accuracy and robustness both in training and testing to detect the PQ disturbance events. Simulation results evaluated that the proposed HOS-EMD based method along with $k$-NN classifier outperformed in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency in comparison to the other state-of-art methods both in clean and noisy environment.",2019-04-05T00:34:38Z,2019-08-14T22:30:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02836v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02836v2,eess.SP
WLAN Indoor Intrusion Detection Based on Deep Signal Feature Fusion and   Minimized-MKMMD Transfer Learning,"M. Zhou, X. Li, Y. Wang, A. Ren, X. Yang","Indoor intrusion detection technology has been widely utilized in network security monitoring, smart city, entertainment games, and other fields. Most existing indoor intrusion detection methods directly exploit the Received Signal Strength (RSS) data collected by Monitor Points (MPs) and do not consider the instability of WLAN signals in the complex indoor environments. In response to this urgent problem, this paper proposes a novel WLAN indoor intrusion detection method based on deep signal feature fusion and Minimized Multiple Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Minimized-MKMMD). Firstly, the multi-branch deep convolutional neural network is used to conduct the dimensionality reduction and feature fusion of the RSS data, and the tags are obtained according to the features of the offline and online RSS fusion features that are corresponding to the silence and intrusion states, and then based on this, the source domain and target domain are constructed respectively. Secondly, the optimal transfer matrix is constructed by minimizing MKMMD. Thirdly, the transferred RSS data in the source domain is utilized for training the classifiers that are applying in getting the classification of the RSS fusion features in the target domain in the same shared subspace. Finally, the intrusion detection of the target environment is realized by iteratively updating the process above until the algorithm converges. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of the intrusion detection system.",2019-10-02T13:01:09Z,2019-10-02T13:01:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02051v1,eess.SP
GCI detection from raw speech using a fully-convolutional network,"Luc Ardaillon, Axel Roebel","Glottal Closure Instants (GCI) detection consists in automatically detecting temporal locations of most significant excitation of the vocal tract from the speech signal. It is used in many speech analysis and processing applications, and various algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. Recently, new approaches using convolutional neural networks have emerged, with encouraging results. Following this trend, we propose a simple approach that performs a mapping from the speech waveform to a target signal from which the GCIs are obtained by peak-picking. However, the ground truth GCIs used for training and evaluation are usually extracted from EGG signals, which are not perfectly reliable and often not available. To overcome this problem, we propose to train our network on high-quality synthetic speech with perfect ground truth. The performances of the proposed algorithm are compared with three other state-of-the-art approaches using publicly available datasets, and the impact of using controlled synthetic or real speech signals in the training stage is investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains similar or better results than other state-of-the-art algorithms and that using large synthetic datasets with many speakers offers a better generalization ability than using a smaller database of real speech and EGG signals.",2019-10-22T21:15:52Z,2020-02-20T17:15:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10235v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10235v2,eess.AS
Short-time detection of QRS complexes using dual channels 1 based on   U-Net and bidirectional long short-term memory,"Runnan He, Yang Liu, Kuanquan Wang, Na Zhao, Yongfeng Yuan, Qince Li, Henggui Zhang","Cardiovascular disease is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and can be reflected by 19 abnormal features of electrocardiogram (ECG). Detecting changes in the QRS complexes in ECG 20 signals is regarded as a straightforward, noninvasive, inexpensive, and preliminary diagnosis approach 21 for evaluating the cardiac health of patients. Therefore, detecting QRS complexes in ECG signals must 22 be accurate over short times. However, the reliability of automatic QRS detection is restricted by all 23 kinds of noise and complex signal morphologies. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm for 24 short-time detection of QRS complexes using dual channels based on U-Net and bidirectional long 25 short-term memory. First, a proposed preprocessor with mean filtering and discrete wavelet transform 26 was initially applied to remove different types of noise. Next the signal was transformed and 27 annotations were relabeled. Finally, a method combining U-Net and bidirectional long short-term 28 memory with dual channels was used for the short-time detection of QRS complexes. The proposed 29 algorithm was trained and tested using 44 ECG records from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

The Statistical Characteristics of Power-Spectrum Subband Energy Ratios   under Additive Gaussian White Noise,"Han Li, Yanzhu Hu, Song Wang, Zhen Meng","The power-spectrum subband energy ratio (PSER) has been applied in a variety of fields, but reports on its statistical properties have been limited. As such, this study investigates these characteristics in the presence of additive Gaussian white noise for both pure noise and mixed signals. By analyzing the probability and independence of power spectrum bins, and the relationship between the F and beta distributions, we develop a probability distribution for the PSER. Results showed that in the case of pure noise, the PSER follows a beta distribution. In addition, the probability density function and the quantile exhibited no relationship with the noise variance, only with the number of lines in the power spectrum, that is, PSER is not affected by noise. When Gaussian white noise was mixed with the known signal, the resulting PSER followed a doubly non-central beta distribution. In this case, it was difficult to identify the quantile, as the probability density and cumulative distribution functions were represented by infinite series. However, when a spectral bin did not contain the power spectrum of the known signal, an approximated quantile was found. This quantile is strictly proved to be in agreement with the quantile in the case of pure noise and offers a convenient methodology for identifying valid signals.",2020-07-08T16:03:28Z,2020-11-18T06:41:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04222v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04222v2,eess.SP
Subcarrier-wise Backscatter Communications over Ambient OFDM for Low   Power IoT,"Mahyar Nemati, Morteza Soltani, Jie Ding, Jinho Choi","Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) over orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) signals has recently been proposed as an appealing technique for low power Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The special spectrum structure of OFDM signals provides a range of flexibility in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performance, data rate, and power consumption. In this paper, we study subcarrier-wise backscatter communication over ambient OFDM signals. This new AmBC is to exploit the special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit data over its squeezed orthogonal subcarriers. We propose a basis transmission scheme and its two modifications to support a higher data rate with superior BER performance compared to existing methods. The basis scheme can transmit one bit per subcarrier using on-off keying (OOK) modulation in the frequency domain. In the first modification, interleaved subcarrier block transmission model is employed to improve the BER performance of the system in frequency-selective channels. It results in a trade-off between the size of the blocks and data rate. Thus, in the second modification, interleaved index modulation (IM) is employed to mitigate the data rate decrementation of the former modification. It also stabilizes and controls the power of the signal to result in interference reduction for a legacy receiver. Analytical and numerical evaluations provide a proof to see the performance of the proposed method in terms of BER, data rate, and interference.",2020-07-16T07:35:28Z,2020-07-16T07:35:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08157v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08157v1,eess.SP

Chechetkin, Vasily V. Lobzin","The genomic ssRNA of coronaviruses is packaged within a helical nucleocapsid. Due to transitional symmetry of a helix, weakly specific cooperative interaction between ssRNA and nucleocapsid proteins leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic assembly/packaging signals in the related genomic sequence. Such signals coordinated with the nucleocapsid helical structure were detected and reconstructed in the genomes of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The main period of the signals for both viruses was about 54 nt, that implies 6.75 nt per N protein. The complete coverage of ssRNA genome of length about 30,000 nt by the nucleocapsid would need 4,400 N proteins, that makes them the most abundant among the structural proteins. The repertoires of motifs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were divergent but nearly coincided for different isolates of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained the distributions of assembly/packaging signals over the genomes with non-overlapping windows of width 432 nt. Finally, using the spectral entropy, we compared the load from point mutations and indels during virus age for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We found the higher mutational load on SARS-CoV. In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 can be treated as a ""newborn"" virus.

Complex ResNet Aided DoA Estimation for Near-Field MIMO Systems,"Yashuai Cao, Tiejun Lv, Zhipeng Lin, Pingmu Huang, Fuhong Lin","The near-field effect of short-range multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems imposes many challenges on direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Most conventional scenarios assume that the far-field planar wavefronts hold. In this paper, we investigate the DoA estimation problem in short-range MIMO communications, where the effect of near-field spherical wave is non-negligible. By converting it into a regression task, a novel DoA estimation framework based on complex-valued deep learning (CVDL) is proposed for the near-field region in short-range MIMO communication systems. Under the assumption of a spherical wave model, the array steering vector is determined by both the distance and the direction. However, solving this regression task containing a massive number of variables is challenging, since datasets need to capture numerous complicated feature representations. To overcome this, a virtual covariance matrix (VCM) based on received signals is constructed, and thus such features extracted from the VCM can deal with the complicated coupling relationship between the direction and the distance. Although the emergence of wireless big data driven by future communication networks promotes deep learning-based wireless signal processing, the learning algorithms of complex-valued signals are still ongoing. This paper proposes a one-dimensional (1-D) residual network that can directly tackle complex-valued features due to the inherent 1-D structure of signal subspace vectors. In addition, we put forth a cropped VCM based policy which can be applied to different antenna sizes. The proposed method is able to fully exploit the complex-valued information. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CVDL approach over the baseline schemes in terms of the accuracy of DoA estimation.",2020-07-21T04:13:25Z,2020-07-21T04:13:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10590v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10590v1,eess.SP
Potential Advantages of Peak Picking Multi-Voltage Threshold Digitizer   in Energy Determination in Radiation Measurement,"Kezhang Zhu, Junhua Mei, Yuming Su, Pingping Dai, Nicola D'Ascenzo, Hao Wang, Peng Xiao, Lin Wan, Qingguo Xie","The Multi-voltage Threshold (MVT) method, which samples the signal by certain reference voltages, has been well developed as being adopted in pre-clinical and clinical digital positron emission tomography(PET) system. To improve its energy measurement performance, we propose a Peak Picking MVT(PP-MVT) Digitizer in this paper. Firstly, a sampled Peak Point(the highest point in pulse signal), which carries the values of amplitude feature voltage and amplitude arriving time, is added to traditional MVT with a simple peak sampling circuit. Secondly, an amplitude deviation statistical analysis, which compares the energy deviation of various reconstruction models, is used to select adaptive reconstruction models for signal pulses with different amplitudes. After processing 30,000 randomly-chosen pulses sampled by the oscilloscope with a 22Na point source, our method achieves an energy resolution of 17.50% within a 450-650 KeV energy window, which is 2.44% better than the result of traditional MVT with same thresholds; and we get a count number at 15225 in the same energy window while the result of MVT is at 14678. When the PP-MVT involves less thresholds than traditional MVT, the advantages of better energy resolution and larger count number can still be maintained, which shows the robustness and the flexibility of PP-MVT Digitizer. This improved method indicates that adding feature peak information could improve the performance on signal sampling and reconstruction, which canbe proved by the better performance in energy determination in radiation measurement.",2021-03-08T11:47:23Z,2021-03-08T11:47:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05532v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05532v1,eess.SP
Nocturnal Seizure Detection Using Off-the-Shelf WiFi,"Belal Korany, Yasamin Mostofi","Detection of nocturnal seizures in epilepsy patients is essential, both for the quick management of the seizure complications, and for the assessment of the ongoing seizure treatment. Traditional seizure detection products (e.g., wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In this paper, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast, and non-invasive detection of nocturnal seizures. We first present a new and rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient, during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g. posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly detect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out extensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of 20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as well as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system detects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds since the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep movements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show the great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal seizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their caregivers.",2021-03-25T01:44:49Z,2021-07-27T23:56:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13556v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13556v2,eess.SP

This work is focusing on the investigation of the powerful capability of the natural logarithmic properties and the possibility of extracting Higher-Order Cumulant's (HOC) features from input data received raw. The HOC signals were extracted under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel with four effective parameters which were defined to distinguished the types of modulation from the set; 4-QAM~1024-QAM. This approach makes the recognizer more intelligent and improves the success rate of classification. From simulation results, which was achieved under statistical models for noisy channels, manifest that recognized algorithm executes was recognizing in M-QAM, furthermore, most results were promising and showed that the logarithmic classifier works well over both AWGN and different fading channels, as well as it can achieve a reliable recognition rate even at a lower signal-to-noise ratio (less than zero), it can be considered as an Integrated Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) system in order to identify high order of M-QAM signals that applied a unique logarithmic classifier, to represents higher versatility, hence it has a superior performance via all previous works in automatic modulation identification system",2019-05-13T06:31:01Z,2019-05-13T06:31:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04876v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04876v1,eess.SP
Simplified Algorithm for Dynamic Demand Response in Smart Homes Under   Smart Grid Environment,"Shashank Singh, Aryesh Namboodiri, M. P.

Demand Response (DR) is a portfolio of signaling schemes from the utility to the consumers for load shifting/shedding with a given deadline. The signaling schemes include Time--of--Use (ToU) pricing, Maximum Demand Limit (MDL) signals etc. This paper proposes a DR algorithm which schedules the operation of home appliances/loads through a minimization problem. The category of loads and their operational timings in a day have been considered as the operational parameters of the system. These operational parameters determine the dynamic priority of a load, which is an intermediate step of this algorithm. The ToU pricing, MDL signals, and the dynamic priority of loads are the constraints in this formulated minimization problem, which yields an optimal schedule of operation for each participating load within the consumer provided duration. The objective is to flatten the daily load curve of a smart home by distributing the operation of its appliances in possible low--price intervals without violating the MDL constraint.

Identification of Edge Disconnections in Networks Based on Graph Filter   Outputs,"Shlomit Shaked, Tirza Routtenberg","Graphs are fundamental mathematical structures used in various fields to model statistical and physical relationships between data, signals, and processes. In some applications, such as data processing in graphs that represent physical networks, the initial network topology is known. However, disconnections of edges in the network change the topology and may affect the signals and processes over the network. In this paper, we consider the problem of edge disconnection identification in networks by using concepts from graph signal processing (GSP). We assume that the graph signals measured over the vertices of the network can be represented as white noise that has been filtered on the graph topology by a smooth graph filter. We develop the likelihood ratio test (LRT) to detect a specific set of edge disconnections. Then, we provide the maximum likelihood (ML) decision rule for identifying general scenarios of edge disconnections in the network. It is shown that the sufficient statistics of the LRT and ML decision rule are the graph frequency energy levels in the graph spectral domain. However, the ML decision rule leads to a high-complexity exhaustive search over the edges in the network and is practically infeasible. Thus, we propose a low-complexity greedy method that identifies a single disconnected edge at each iteration. Moreover, by using the smoothness of the considered graph filter, we suggest a local implementation of the decision rule, which is based solely on the measurements at neighboring vertices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing detection and identification methods on a synthetic dataset and for line outage identification in power systems from the IEEE 118-bus test case.",2021-02-12T10:16:07Z,2021-06-30T08:00:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06428v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06428v2,eess.SP
Phased Array-Based Sub-Nyquist Sampling for Joint Wideband Spectrum   Sensing and Direction-of-Arrival Estimation,"Feiyu Wang, Jun Fang, Huiping Duan, Hongbin Li","In this paper, we study the problem of joint wideband spectrum sensing and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation in a sub-Nyquist sampling framework. Specifically, considering a scenario where a few uncorrelated narrowband signals spread over a wide (say, several GHz) frequency band, our objective is to estimate the carrier frequencies and the DoAs associated with the narrowband sources, as well as reconstruct the power spectra of these narrowband signals. To overcome the sampling rate bottleneck for wideband spectrum sensing, we propose a new phased-array based sub-Nyquist sampling architecture with variable time delays, where a uniform linear array (ULA) is employed and the received signal at each antenna is delayed by a variable amount of time and then sampled by a synchronized low-rate analog-digital converter (ADC). Based on the collected sub-Nyquist samples, we calculate a set of cross-correlation matrices with different time lags, and develop a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition-based method for joint DoA, carrier frequency and power spectrum recovery. Perfect recovery conditions for the associated parameters and the power spectrum are analyzed. Our analysis reveals that our proposed method does not require to place any sparse constraint on the wideband spectrum, only needs the sampling rate to be greater than the bandwidth of the narrowband source signal with the largest bandwidth among all sources.

Heart Rate Monitoring During Different Lung Volume Phases Using   Seismocardiography,"Amirtaha Taebi, Andrew J Bomar, Richard H Sandler, Hansen A Mansy","Seismocardiography (SCG) is a non-invasive method that can be used for cardiac activity monitoring. This paper presents a new electrocardiogram (ECG) independent approach for estimating heart rate (HR) during low and high lung volume (LLV and HLV, respectively) phases using SCG signals. In this study, SCG, ECG, and respiratory flow rate (RFR) signals were measured simultaneously in 7 healthy subjects. The lung volume information was calculated from the RFR and was used to group the SCG events into low and high lung-volume groups. LLV and HLV SCG events were then used to estimate the subjects HR as well as the HR during LLV and HLV in 3 different postural positions, namely supine, 45 degree heads-up, and sitting. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested against the standard ECG measurements. Results showed that the HR estimations from the SCG and ECG signals were in a good agreement (bias of 0.08 bpm). All subjects were found to have a higher HR during HLV (HR$_\text{HLV}$) compared to LLV (HR$_\text{LLV}$) at all postural positions. The HR$_\text{HLV}$/HR$_\text{LLV}$ ratio was 1.11$\pm$0.07, 1.08$\pm$0.05, 1.09$\pm$0.04, and 1.09$\pm$0.04 (mean$\pm$SD) for supine, 45 degree-first trial, 45 degree-second trial, and sitting positions, respectively.

In this paper bit error rate of an image, signal is transmitted over fading channel is analyzed using orthogonal frequency multiplexing and channel estimation technique. An Orthogonal Frequency Multiplexing (OFDM) provides prominent bandwidth effectiveness and improved immunity to the fading environments. In OFDM, the data is modulated using multiple numbers of subcarriers that are orthogonal to each other.

For this, it is needed to measure cardiac-induced chest-wall vibrations, reflected in the SCG signal. Orthogonal subspace projection is employed to extract the SCG cycles with the help of a concurrent ECG signal. Subsequently, fifteen statistically significant morphological-features are extracted from each of the SCG cycles. These features can efficiently characterize physiological changes due to varying respiratory rates. Stacked autoencoder (SAE) based architecture is employed for the identification of different respiratory-effort levels.

Low-complexity and Low-overhead Receiver for OTFS via Large-scale   Antenna Array,"Yaru Shan, Fanggang Wang","Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a modulation technique that is dedicated to the high-speed mobility scenario. However, its transmission involves a two-dimensional convolution of the symbols of interest and the multipath fading channel, and it complicates the equalization. In addition to the high-complexity issue, the existing pilot pattern to estimate the unknown channel accurately requires large overhead to avoid the pilot being contaminated, which is spectrally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a receiver approach by the marriage of the OTFS and a large-scale antenna array, which allows low-complexity detection and low-overhead pilot pattern design. First, the received signal from each path of the multipath fading channel is identified by a high-resolution receive beamformer facilitated by a large-scale antenna array. Then the identified signal from each angle in the delay-Doppler domain reduces to a flat-faded signal, which can be simply equalized using the channel information estimated by our pilot pattern. We further provide the estimator of the channel fading and the rotations of delay and Doppler. With these estimates, the symbols of interest can be recovered, and then, the signals from all angles of arrival are combined as different diversity versions. In addition, our pilot pattern with only around 25% overhead of the existing pilot pattern ensures the same protection of pilot pollution. Eventually, the efficiency, the reliability, and the low complexity of the proposed receiver approach are further validated by the numerical results.",2020-05-16T08:49:44Z,2020-05-16T08:49:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07910v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07910v1,eess.SP
Optical Wake-up from Power-off State for Autonomous Optical Sensor Nodes,"Uliana Dudko, Ludger Overmeyer","Wireless sensor nodes spend most of their time in standby mode and wake up periodically to send the measurement data. Conventionally, the wake-up function is realized using a radio-frequency oscillator with an amplifier to recognize an activating radio signal. Therefore, even during standby operation, the sensor node utilizes a certain amount of energy, which can be critical for an energy-harvesting source. In this study, we propose a novel approach of an optical wake-up for autonomous sensor nodes, which employs a solar cell as a wake-up signal detector. The bright light flash coming from another node or a smartphone exposes a solar cell, which activates the sensor node. Unlike photodiodes or RF-antennas, solar cells do not require any additional energy to detect the light signal. Therefore, the proposed electric circuit allows the sensor node to wake-up from a complete power-off state. The solar cell of the novel wake-up receiver has a sensitive area of 8 mm x 10 mm. The wake-up signal can be recognized from a maximal distance of 25 cm at ambient illumination from 0 to 1600 lx with a transmitter optical power of 20 mW. At power-off state the power consumptions are the lowest among all existing off-the-shelf wake-up receivers: 248 pW at 0 lx and 627 nW at 1600 lx.",2020-05-20T08:49:30Z,2020-05-20T08:49:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09914v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09914v1,eess.SP
Self-Interference Channel Characterization in Underwater Acoustic   In-Band Full-Duplex Communications Using OFDM,"Mohammad Towliat, Zheng Guo, Leonard J. Cimini, Xiang-Gen Xia, Aijun Song","Due to the limited available bandwidth and dynamic channel, data rates are extremely limited in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. Addressing this concern, in-band fullduplex (IBFD) has the potential to double the efficiency in a given bandwidth. In an IBFD scheme, transmission and reception are performed simultaneously in the same frequency band. However, in UWA-IBFD, because of reflections from the surface and bottom and the inhomogeneity of the water, a significant part of the transmitted signal returns back to the IBFD receiver. This signal contaminates the desired signal from the remote end and is known as the self-interference (SI). With an estimate of the self-interference channel impulse response (SCIR), a receiver can estimate and eliminate the SI. A better understanding of the statistical characteristics of the SCIR is necessary for an accurate SI cancellation. In this article, we use an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal to characterize the SCIR in a lake water experiment. To verify the results, SCIR estimation is performed using estimators in both the frequency and time domains. We show that, in our experiment, regardless of the depth of the hydrophone, the direct path of SCIR is strong, stable and easily tracked; however, the reflection paths are weaker and rapidly time-varying making SI cancellation challenging. Among the reflections, the first bounce from the water surface is the prevalent path with a short coherence time around 70 ms.",2020-05-21T22:45:12Z,2020-05-21T22:45:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10933v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10933v1,eess.SP
A Statistical Approach to Signal Denoising Based on Data-driven   Multiscale Representation,"Khuram Naveed, Muhammad Tahir Akhtar, Muhammad Faisal Siddiqui, Naveed ur Rehman","We develop a data-driven approach for signal denoising that utilizes variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm and Cramer Von Misses (CVM) statistic. In comparison with the classical empirical mode decomposition (EMD), VMD enjoys superior mathematical and theoretical framework that makes it robust to noise and mode mixing. These desirable properties of VMD materialize in segregation of a major part of noise into a few final modes while majority of the signal content is distributed among the earlier ones. To exploit this representation for denoising purpose, we propose to estimate the distribution of noise from the predominantly noisy modes and then use it to detect and reject noise from the remaining modes. The proposed approach first selects the predominantly noisy modes using the CVM measure of statistical distance. Next, CVM statistic is used locally on the remaining modes to test how closely the modes fit the estimated noise distribution; the modes that yield closer fit to the noise distribution are rejected (set to zero). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as compared to the state of the art in signal denoising and underscore its utility in practical applications where noise distribution is not known a priori.",2020-05-31T23:22:39Z,2020-05-31T23:22:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00640v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00640v1,eess.SP
Hidden Markov Models Applied To Intraday Momentum Trading With Side   Information,"Hugh Christensen, Simon Godsill, Richard E Turner","A Hidden Markov Model for intraday momentum trading is presented which specifies a latent momentum state responsible for generating the observed securities' noisy returns. Existing momentum trading models suffer from time-lagging caused by the delayed frequency response of digital filters. Time-lagging results in a momentum signal of the wrong sign, when the market changes trend direction. A key feature of this state space formulation, is no such lagging occurs, allowing for accurate shifts in signal sign at market change points. The number of latent states in the model is estimated using three techniques, cross validation, penalized likelihood criteria and simulation-based model selection for the marginal likelihood. All three techniques suggest either 2 or 3 hidden states. Model parameters are then found using Baum-Welch and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, whilst assuming a single (discretized) univariate Gaussian distribution for the emission matrix. Often a momentum trader will want to condition their trading signals on additional information. To reflect this, learning is also carried out in the presence of side information. Two sets of side information are considered, namely a ratio of realized volatilities and intraday seasonality. It is shown that splines can be used to capture statistically significant relationships from this information, allowing returns to be predicted. An Input Output Hidden Markov Model is used to incorporate these univariate predictive signals into the transition matrix, presenting a possible solution for dealing with the signal combination problem. Bayesian inference is then carried out to predict the securities $t+1$ return using the forward algorithm. Simple modifications to the current framework allow for a fully non-parametric model with asynchronous prediction.",2020-06-15T11:57:05Z,2020-06-15T11:57:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08307v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08307v1,q-fin.TR
MetaSketch: Wireless Semantic Segmentation by Metamaterial Surfaces,"Jingzhi Hu, Hongliang Zhang, Kaigui Bian, Zhu Han, H. Vincent Poor, Lingyang Song","Semantic segmentation is a process of partitioning an image into multiple segments for recognizing humans and objects, which can be widely applied in scenarios such as healthcare and safety monitoring. To avoid privacy violation, using RF signals instead of an image for human and object recognition has gained increasing attention. However, human and object recognition by using RF signals is usually a passive signal collection and analysis process without changing the radio environment, and the recognition accuracy is restricted significantly by unwanted multi-path fading, and/or the limited number of independent channels between RF transceivers in uncontrollable radio environments. This paper introduces MetaSketch, a novel RF-sensing system that performs semantic recognition and segmentation for humans and objects by making the radio environment reconfigurable. A metamaterial surface is incorporated into MetaSketch and diversifies the information carried by RF signals. Using compressive sensing techniques, MetaSketch reconstructs a point cloud consisting of the reflection coefficients of humans and objects at different spatial points, and recognizes the semantic meaning of the points by using symmetric multilayer perceptron groups. Our evaluation results show that MetaSketch is capable of generating favorable radio environments and extracting exact point clouds, and labeling the semantic meaning of the points with an average error rate of less than 1% in an indoor space.",2021-08-14T03:34:22Z,2021-10-06T02:58:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06456v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06456v3,"eess.SP, eess.IV"
Neuromodulators in food ingredients: insights from network   pharmacological evaluation of Ayurvedic herbs,"Neha Choudhary, Vikram Singh","The global burden of neurological diseases, the second leading cause of death after heart dis-eases constitutes one of the major challenges of modern medicine. Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medicinal systemenrooted in the Vedic literature and considered as a schema for the holistic management of health, characterizes various neurological diseases disorders (NDDs) and prescribes several herbs, formulations, and bio-cleansing regimes for their care and cure. In this work, we examined neuro-phytoregulatory potential of 34,472 phytochemicals among 3,038 herbs (including their varieties) mentioned in Ayurveda using network pharmacology approach and found that 45% of these Ayurvedic phytochemicals (APCs) have regulatory associations with 1,643 approved protein targets. Metabolite interconversion enzymes and protein modifying enzymes were found to be the major target classes of APCs against NDDs. The study further suggests that the actions of Ayurvedic herbs in managing NDDs were majorly via regulating signalling processes, like, G-protein signaling, acetylcholine signaling, chemokine signaling pathway and GnRH signaling. A high confidence network specific to 219 pharmaceutically relevant neuro-phytoregulators (NPRs) from 1,197 Ayurvedic herbs against 102 approved protein-targets involved in NDDs was developed and analyzed for gaining mechanistic insights. The key protein targets of NPRs to elicit their neuro-regulatory effect were highlighted as CYP and TRPA, while estradiol and melatonin were identified as the NPRs with high multi-targeting ability. 32 herbs enriched in NPRs were identified that include some of the well-known Ayurvedic neurological recommendations, like, Papaver somniferum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Citrus aurantium, Cannabis sativa etc. Herbs enriched in NPRs may be used as a chemical source library for drug-discovery against NDDs from systems medicine perspectives.",2021-08-22T15:05:16Z,2021-08-22T15:05:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09747v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09747v1,q-bio.BM
Reconsidering Spatial Priors In EEG Source Estimation: Does White Matter   Contribute to EEG Rhythms?,"PK Douglas, DB Douglas","Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a core tool used in functional neuroimaging in humans for nearly a hundred years. Because it is inexpensive, easy to implement, and noninvasive, it also represents an excellent candidate modality for use in the BCI setting. Nonetheless, a complete understanding of how EEG measurements (voltage fluctuations) relate to information processing in the brain remains somewhat elusive. A deeper understanding of the neuroanatomical underpinnings of the EEG signal may help explain inter-individual variability in evoked and induced potentials, which may improve BCI therapies targeted to the individual. According to classic biophysical models, EEG fluctuations are primarily a reflection of locally synchronized neuronal oscillations within the gray matter oriented approximately orthogonal to the scalp. In contrast, global models ignore local signals due to dendritic processing, and suggest that propagation delays due to white matter architecture are responsible for the EEG signal, and are capable of explaining the coherence between numerous rhythms (e.g., alpha) at spatially distinct areas of the scalp. Recently, combined local-global models suggest that the EEG signal may reflect a superposition of local processing along with global contributors including transduction along white matter tracts in the brain. Incorporating both local and global (e.g., white matter) priors into EEG source models may therefore improve source estimates. These models may also help disentangle which aspects of the EEG signal are predicted to colocalize spatially with measurements from functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we explore the possibility that white matter conductivity contributes to EEG measurements via a generative model based on classic axonal transduction models, and discuss its potential implications for source estimation.",2021-11-17T07:08:37Z,2021-11-17T07:08:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08939v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08939v1,q-bio.NC
A Subject-Independent Brain-Computer Interface Framework Based on   Supervised Autoencoder,"Navid Ayoobi, Elnaz Banan Sadeghian","A calibration procedure is required in motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) to tune the system for new users. This procedure is time-consuming and prevents na\""ive users from using the system immediately. Developing a subject-independent MI-BCI system to reduce the calibration phase is still challenging due to the subject-dependent characteristics of the MI signals. Many algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning have been developed to extract high-level features from the MI signals to improve the subject-to-subject generalization of a BCI system. However, these methods are based on supervised learning and extract features useful for discriminating various MI signals. Hence, these approaches cannot find the common underlying patterns in the MI signals and their generalization level is limited. This paper proposes a subject-independent MI-BCI based on a supervised autoencoder (SAE) to circumvent the calibration phase. The suggested framework is validated on dataset 2a from BCI competition IV. The simulation results show that our SISAE model outperforms the conventional and widely used BCI algorithms, common spatial and filter bank common spatial patterns, in terms of the mean Kappa value, in eight out of nine subjects.",2022-04-19T02:59:28Z,2022-04-19T02:59:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08626v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08626v1,eess.SP
Dir-MUSIC Algorithm for DOA Estimation of Partial Discharge Based on   Signal Strength represented by Antenna Gain Array Manifold,"Wencong Xu, Yandong Li, Bingshu Chen, Yue Hu, Jianxu Li, Zijing Zeng","Inspection robots are widely used in the field of smart grid monitoring in substations, and partial discharge (PD) is an important sign of the insulation state of equipments. PD direction of arrival (DOA) algorithms using conventional beamforming and time difference of arrival (TDOA) require large-scale antenna arrays and high computational complexity, which make them difficult to implement on inspection robots. To address this problem, a novel directional multiple signal classification (Dir-MUSIC) algorithm for PD direction finding based on signal strength is proposed, and a miniaturized directional spiral antenna circular array is designed in this paper. First, the Dir-MUSIC algorithm is derived based on the array manifold characteristics. This method uses strength intensity information rather than the TDOA information, which could reduce the computational difficulty and the requirement of array size. Second, the effects of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and array manifold error on the performance of the algorithm are discussed through simulations in detail. Then according to the positioning requirements, the antenna array and its arrangement are developed, optimized, and simulation results suggested that the algorithm has reliable direction-finding performance in the form of 6 elements. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is tested by using the designed spiral circular array in real scenarios. The experimental results show that the PD direction-finding error is 3.39{\deg}, which can meet the need for Partial discharge DOA estimation using inspection robots in substations.",2022-04-19T04:50:06Z,2022-04-19T04:50:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08661v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08661v1,eess.SP
Using rxncon to develop rule based models,"Jesper Romers, Sebastian Thieme, Ulrike M√ºnzner, Marcus Krantz","We present a protocol for building, validating and simulating models of signal transduction networks. These networks are challenging modelling targets due to the combinatorial complexity and sparse data, which have made it a major challenge even to formalise the current knowledge. To address this, the community has developed methods to model biomolecular reaction networks based on site dynamics. The strength of this approach is that reactions and states can be defined at variable resolution, which makes it possible to adapt the model resolution to the empirical data. This improves both scalability and accuracy, making it possible to formalise large models of signal transduction networks. Here, we present a method to build and validate large models of signal transduction networks. The workflow is based on rxncon, the reaction-contingency language. In a five-step process, we create a mechanistic network model, convert it into an executable Boolean model, use the Boolean model to evaluate and improve the network, and finally export the rxncon model into a rule based format. We provide an introduction to the rxncon language and an annotated, step-by-step protocol for the workflow. Finally, we create a small model of the insulin signalling pathway to illustrate the protocol, together with some of the challenges - and some of their solutions - in modelling signal transduction.",2018-02-05T10:18:44Z,2018-02-05T10:18:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01328v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01328v1,q-bio.MN
Iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance Based Approaches for Array   Processing,"Habti Abeida, Qilin Zhang, Jian Li, Nadjim Merabtine","This paper presents a series of user parameter-free iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance (SAMV) approaches for array processing applications based on the asymptotically minimum variance (AMV) criterion. With the assumption of abundant snapshots in the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem, the signal powers and noise variance are jointly estimated by the proposed iterative AMV approach, which is later proved to coincide with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator. We then propose a series of power-based iterative SAMV approaches, which are robust against insufficient snapshots, coherent sources and arbitrary array geometries. Moreover, to overcome the direction grid limitation on the estimation accuracy, the SAMV-Stochastic ML (SAMV-SML) approaches are derived by explicitly minimizing a closed form stochastic ML cost function with respect to one scalar parameter, eliminating the need of any additional grid refinement techniques. To assist the performance evaluation, approximate solutions to the SAMV approaches are also provided at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low SNR, respectively. Finally, numerical examples are generated to compare the performance of the proposed approaches with existing approaches.",2018-02-08T23:03:53Z,2018-02-08T23:03:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03070v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03070v1,eess.SP
Ordered Sequence Detection and Barrier Signal Design for Digital Pulse   Interval Modulation in Optical Wireless Communications,"Shuaishuai Guo, Ki-Hong Park, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","This paper proposes an ordered sequence detection (OSD) for digital pulse interval modulation (DPIM) in optical wireless communications. Leveraging the sparsity of DPIM sequences, OSD shows comparable performance to the optimal maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) with much lower complexity. Compared with the widely adopted sample-by-sample optimal threshold detection (OTD), it considerably improves the bit error rate (BER) performance by mitigating error propagation. Moreover, this paper proposes a barrier signal-aided digital pulse interval modulation (BDPIM), where the last of every $K$ symbols is allocated with more power as an inserted barrier signal. BDPIM with OSD (BDPIM-OSD) can limit the error propagation between two adjacent barriers. To reduce the storing delay when using OSD to detect extremely large packets, we propose BDPIM with a combination of OTD and OSD (BDPIM-OTD-OSD), within which long sequences are cut into pieces and separately detected. Approximate upper bounds of the average BER performance of DPIM-OTD, DPIM-OSD, BDPIM-OSD and BDPIM-OTD-OSD are analyzed. Simulations are conducted to corroborate our analysis. Optimal parameter settings are also investigated in uncoded and coded systems by simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed OSD and BDPIM bring significant improvement in uncoded and coded systems over various channels.",2018-04-12T11:26:21Z,2018-12-26T05:02:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04431v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04431v2,eess.SP
Enhancement of Throat Microphone Recordings Using Gaussian Mixture Model   Probabilistic Estimator,Mehmet Ali Tugtekin Turan,"The throat microphone is a body-attached transducer that is worn against the neck. It captures the signals that are transmitted through the vocal folds, along with the buzz tone of the larynx. Due to its skin contact, it is more robust to the environmental noise compared to the acoustic microphone that picks up the vibrations through air pressure, and hence the all interventions. The throat speech is partly intelligible, but gives unnatural and croaky sound. This thesis tries to recover missing frequency bands of the throat speech and investigates envelope and excitation mapping problem with joint analysis of throat- and acoustic-microphone recordings. A new phone-dependent GMM-based spectral envelope mapping scheme, which performs the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the acoustic-microphone spectral envelope, has been proposed. In the source-filter decomposition framework, we observed that the spectral envelope difference of the excitation signals of throat- and acoustic-microphone recordings is an important source of the degradation in the throat-microphone voice quality. Thus, we also model spectral envelope difference of the excitation signals as a spectral tilt vector, and propose a new phone-dependent GMM-based spectral tilt mapping scheme to enhance throat excitation signal. Experimental evaluations are performed to compare the proposed mapping scheme using both objective and subjective evaluations. Objective evaluations are performed with the log-spectral distortion (LSD) and the wide-band perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metrics. Subjective evaluations are performed with A/B pair comparison listening test. Both objective and subjective evaluations yield that the proposed phone-dependent mapping consistently improves performances over the state-of-the-art GMM estimators.",2018-04-13T13:05:01Z,2018-04-13T13:05:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05937v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05937v1,"eess.AS, eess.SP"
Robust Differential Received Signal Strength-Based Localization,"Yongchang Hu, Geert Leus","Source localization based on signal strength measurements has become very popular due to its practical simplicity. However, the severe nonlinearity and non-convexity make the related optimization problem mathematically difficult to solve, especially when the transmit power or the path-loss exponent (PLE) is unknown. Moreover, even if the PLE is known but not perfectly estimated or the anchor location information is not accurate, the constructed data model will become uncertain, making the problem again hard to solve. This paper particularly focuses on differential received signal strength (DRSS)-based localization with model uncertainties in case of unknown transmit power and PLE. A new whitened model for DRSS-based localization with unknown transmit powers is first presented and investigated. When assuming the PLE is known, we introduce two estimators based on an exact data model, an advanced best linear unbiased estimator (A-BLUE) and a Lagrangian estimator (LE), and then we present a robust semidefinite programming (SDP)-based estimator (RSDPE), which can cope with model uncertainties (imperfect PLE and inaccurate anchor location information). The three proposed estimators have their own advantages from different perspectives: the A-BLUE has the lowest complexity; the LE holds the best accuracy for a small measurement noise; and the RSDPE yields the best performance under a large measurement noise and possesses a very good robustness against model uncertainties. Finally, we propose a robust SDP-based block coordinate descent estimator (RSDP-BCDE) to deal with a completely unknown PLE and its performance converges to that of the RSDPE using a perfectly known PLE.",2018-07-10T08:52:16Z,2018-07-10T08:52:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03530v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03530v1,eess.SP
Recognising Cardiac Abnormalities in Wearable Device   Photoplethysmography (PPG) with Deep Learning,"Stewart Whiting, Samuel Moreland, Jason Costello, Glen Colopy, Christopher McCann","Cardiac abnormalities affecting heart rate and rhythm are commonly observed in both healthy and acutely unwell people. Although many of these are benign, they can sometimes indicate a serious health risk. ECG monitors are typically used to detect these events in electrical heart activity, however they are impractical for continuous long-term use. In contrast, current-generation wearables with optical photoplethysmography (PPG) have gained popularity with their low-cost, lack of wires and tiny size. Many cardiac abnormalities such as ectopic beats and AF can manifest as both obvious and subtle anomalies in a PPG waveform as they disrupt blood flow. We propose an automatic method for recognising these anomalies in PPG signal alone, without the need for ECG. We train an LSTM deep neural network on 400,000 clean PPG samples to learn typical PPG morphology and rhythm, and flag PPG signal diverging from this as cardiac abnormalities. We compare the cardiac abnormalities our approach recognises with the ectopic beats recorded by a bedside ECG monitor for 29 patients over 47.6 hours of gold standard observations. Our proposed cardiac abnormality recognition approach recognises 60%+ of ECG-detected PVCs in PPG signal, with a false positive rate of 23% - demonstrating the compelling power and value of this novel approach.

Higher order tensor decomposition for proportional myoelectric control   based on muscle synergies,"Ahmed Ebied, Eli Kinney-Lang, Javier Escudero","Muscle synergies have recently been utilised in myoelectric control systems. Thus far, all proposed synergy-based systems rely on matrix factorisation methods. However, this is limited in terms of task-dimensionality. Here, the potential application of higher-order tensor decomposition as a framework for proportional myoelectric control is demonstrated. A novel constrained Tucker decomposition (consTD) technique of synergy extraction is proposed for synergy-based myoelectric control model and compared with state-of-the-art matrix factorisation models. The extracted synergies were used to estimate control signals for the wrist's Degree of Freedom (DoF) through direct projection. The consTD model was able to estimate the control signals for each DoF by utilising all data in one 3rd-order tensor. This is contrast with matrix factorisation models where data are segmented for each DoF and then the synergies often have to be realigned. Moreover, the consTD method offers more information by providing additional shared synergies, unlike matrix factorisation methods. The extracted control signals were fed to a ridge regression to estimate the wrist's kinematics based on real glove data. The Coefficient of Determination (R2) for the reconstructed wrist position showed that the proposed consTD was higher than matrix factorisation methods. In sum, this study provides the first proof of concept for the use of higher-order tensor decomposition in proportional myoelectric control and it highlights the potential of tensors to provide an objective and direct approach to identify synergies.",2018-11-17T03:17:53Z,2021-07-06T19:23:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07086v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07086v2,eess.SP
Artificial Intelligence Enhances the Performance of Chaos-based Wireless   Communication,"Hai-Peng Ren, Hong-Er Zhao, Chao Bai, Hui-Ping Yin, Celso Grebogi","Some new findings for chaos-based wireless communication systems have been identified recently. First, chaos has proven to be the optimal communication waveform because chaotic signals can achieve the maximum signal to noise ratio at receiver with the simplest matched filter. Second, the information transmitted in chaotic signals is not modified by the multipath wireless channel. Third, chaos properties can be used to relief inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation. Although recent work has reported the method of obtaining the optimal threshold to eliminate the ISI in chaos-based wireless communication, its practical implementation is still a challenge. By knowing the channel parameters and all symbols, especially the future symbol to be transmitted in advance, it is almost an impossible task in the practical communication systems. Owning to Artificial intelligence (AI) recent developments, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with deep learning structure is being proposed to predict future symbols based on the received signal, so as to further reduce ISI and obtain better bit error rate (BER) performance as compared to that used the existing sub-optimal threshold.

"Bandwidth Is Not Enough: ""Hidden"" Outlier Noise and Its Mitigation","Alexei V. Nikitin, Ruslan L. Davidchack","In addition to ever-present thermal noise, communication and sensor systems can contain significant amounts of interference with outlier (e.g. impulsive) characteristics. Such outlier interference (including that caused by nonlinear signal distortions, e.g. clipping) can be efficiently mitigated in real-time using intermittently nonlinear filters. Depending on the interference nature and composition, improvements in the quality of the signal of interest achieved by such filtering will vary from ""no harm"" to substantial. In this tutorial, we explain in detail why the underlying outlier nature of interference often remains obscured, discussing the many challenges and misconceptions associated with state-of-art analog and/or digital nonlinear mitigation techniques, especially when addressing complex practical interference scenarios. We then focus on the methodology and tools for real-time outlier noise mitigation, demonstrating how the ""excess band"" observation of outlier noise enables its efficient in-band mitigation. We introduce the basic real-time nonlinear components that are used for outlier noise filtering and provide examples of their implementation. We further describe complementary nonlinear filtering arrangements for wide- and narrow-band outlier noise reduction, providing illustrations of their performance and the effect on channel capacity. Finally, we outline ""effectively analog"" digital implementations of these filtering structures, discuss their broader applications, and comment on the ongoing development of the platform for their demonstration and testing. To emphasize the effectiveness and versatility of this approach, in our examples we use particularly challenging waveforms that severely obscure low-amplitude outlier noise, such as broadband chirp signals (e.g. used in radar, sonar, and spread-spectrum communications) and ""bursty,"" high crest factor signals (e.g. OFDM).",2019-07-08T16:07:00Z,2019-07-08T16:07:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04186v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04186v1,eess.SP
On Oversampling-Based Signal Detection,"Andrea Mariani, Andrea Giorgetti, Marco Chiani","The availability of inexpensive devices allows nowadays to implement cognitive radio functionalities in large-scale networks such as the internet-of-things and future mobile cellular systems. In this paper, we focus on wideband spectrum sensing in the presence of oversampling, i.e., the sampling frequency of a digital receiver is larger than the signal bandwidth, where signal detection must take into account the front-end impairments of low-cost devices. Based on the noise model of a software-defined radio dongle, we address the problem of robust signal detection in the presence of noise power uncertainty and non-flat noise power spectral density (PSD). In particular, we analyze the receiver operating characteristic of several detectors in the presence of such front-end impairments, to assess the performance attainable in a real-world scenario. We propose new frequency-domain detectors, some of which are proven to outperform previously proposed spectrum sensing techniques such as, e.g., eigenvalue-based tests. The study shows that the best performance is provided by a noise-uncertainty immune energy detector (ED) and, for the colored noise case, by tests that match the PSD of the receiver noise.",2019-07-31T13:51:32Z,2019-07-31T13:51:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13505v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13505v1,eess.SP
COOK: Chirp-OOK Communication with Self-reliant Bitrate Adaptation in   Backscatter Networks,"Gang Huang, Panlong Yang, Xin He, Yubo Yan, Hao Zhou, Xiangyang Li, Pengjun Wan","For large-scale Internet of Things (IoT), backscatter communication is a promising technology to reduce power consumption and simplify deployment. However, backscatter communication lacks stability, along with limited communication range within a few meters. Due to the limited computation ability of backscatter tags, it is burdensome to effectively adapt the bitrate for the time-varying channel. Thus, backscatter tags are failed to fully utilize the optimal transmission rate. In this paper, we design a system named COOK with self-reliant bitrate adaptation in backscatter communication. Channel symmetry allows backscatter tags to adjust bitrate depending on the received signal strength of the excitation source (ES) without feedback. In addition, the chirp spreading signal is exploited as the ES signal to enable backscatter tags to work under noise floor. Our modulation approach is denoted as Chirp-OOK since the tags reflect the chirp signal by employing the on-off keying modulation. It allows that receiver can decode under the noise floor and the bitrate varies flexibly as the communication range changes. We have implemented the prototype system based on the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) platform. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Our system provides valid communication distance up to $27m$, which is 7 times as compared with normal backscatter system. The system significantly increases the backscatter communication stability, by supporting bitrate adaptation ranges from 0.33kbps to 1.2Mbps, and guaranteeing the bit error rate (BER) is below 1%.",2019-11-26T09:35:49Z,2019-11-26T09:35:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11417v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11417v1,eess.SP
Testing for high frequency features in a noisy signal,"Mathieu Mezache, Marc Hoffmann, Human Rezaei, Marie Doumic","Given nonstationary data, one generally wants to extract the trend from the noise by smoothing or filtering. However, it is often important to delineate a third intermediate category, that we call high frequency (HF) features: this is the case in our motivating example, which consists in experimental measurements of the time-dynamics of depolymerising protein fibrils average size. One may intuitively visualise HF features as the presence of fast, possibly nonstationary and transient oscillations, distinct from a slowly-varying trend envelope. The aim of this article is to propose an empirical definition of HF features and construct estimators and statistical tests for their presence accordingly, when the data consists of a noisy nonstationary 1-dimensional signal. We propose a parametric characterization in the Fourier domain of the HF features by defining a maximal amplitude and distance to low frequencies of significant energy. We introduce a data-driven procedure to estimate these parameters, and compute a p-value proxy based on a statistical test for the presence of HF features. The test is first conducted on simulated signals where the ratio amplitude of the HF features to the level of the noise is controlled. The test detects HF features even when the level of noise is five times larger than the amplitude of the oscillations. In a second part, the test is conducted on experimental data from Prion disease experiments and it confirms the presence of HF features in these signals with significant confidence.",2019-11-28T14:04:30Z,2019-11-28T14:04:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12719v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12719v1,eess.SP
"Joint User Identification, Channel Estimation, and Signal Detection for   Grant-Free NOMA","Shuchao Jiang, Xiaojun Yuan, Xin Wang, Chongbin Xu, Wei Yu","For massive machine-type communications, centralized control may incur a prohibitively high overhead. Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) provides possible solutions, yet poses new challenges for efficient receiver design. In this paper, we develop a joint user identification, channel estimation, and signal detection (JUICESD) algorithm. We divide the whole detection scheme into two modules: slot-wise multi-user detection (SMD) and combined signal and channel estimation (CSCE). SMD is designed to decouple the transmissions of different users by leveraging the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms, and CSCE is designed to deal with the nonlinear coupling of activity state, channel coefficient and transmit signal of each user separately. To address the problem that the exact calculation of the messages exchanged within CSCE and between the two modules is complicated due to phase ambiguity issues, this paper proposes a rotationally invariant Gaussian mixture (RIGM) model, and develops an efficient JUICESD-RIGM algorithm. JUICESD-RIGM achieves a performance close to JUICESD with a much lower complexity. Capitalizing on the feature of RIGM, we further analyze the performance of JUICESD-RIGM with state evolution techniques. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve a significant performance improvement over the existing alternatives, and the derived state evolution method predicts the system performance accurately.",2020-01-12T13:43:31Z,2020-07-05T03:17:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03930v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03930v2,eess.SP
Graph Fourier Transform: A Stable Approximation,"Jo√£o Domingos, Jos√© M. F. Moura","In Graph Signal Processing (GSP), data dependencies are represented by a graph whose nodes label the data and the edges capture dependencies among nodes. The graph is represented by a weighted adjacency matrix $A$ that, in GSP, generalizes the Discrete Signal Processing (DSP) shift operator $z^{-1}$. The (right) eigenvectors of the shift $A$ (graph spectral components) diagonalize $A$ and lead to a graph Fourier basis $F$ that provides a graph spectral representation of the graph signal. The inverse of the (matrix of the) graph Fourier basis $F$ is the Graph Fourier transform (GFT), $F^{-1}$. Often, including in real world examples, this diagonalization is numerically unstable. This paper develops an approach to compute an accurate approximation to $F$ and $F^{-1}$, while insuring their numerical stability, by means of solving a non convex optimization problem. To address the non-convexity, we propose an algorithm, the stable graph Fourier basis algorithm (SGFA) that we prove to exponentially increase the accuracy of the approximating $F$ per iteration. Likewise, we can apply SGFA to $A^H$ and, hence, approximate the stable left eigenvectors for the graph shift $A$ and directly compute the GFT. We evaluate empirically the quality of SGFA by applying it to graph shifts $A$ drawn from two real world problems, the 2004 US political blogs graph and the Manhattan road map, carrying out a comprehensive study on tradeoffs between different SGFA parameters. We also confirm our conclusions by applying SGFA on very sparse and very dense directed Erd\H os-R\'enyi graphs.",2020-01-14T20:48:35Z,2020-05-04T15:39:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05042v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05042v2,eess.SP
Unsupervised learning of control signals and their encodings in   $\textit{C. elegans}$ whole-brain recordings,"Charles Fieseler, Manuel Zimmer, J. Nathan Kutz","Recent whole brain imaging experiments on $\textit{C. elegans}$ has revealed that the neural population dynamics encode motor commands and stereotyped transitions between behaviors on low dimensional manifolds. Efforts to characterize the dynamics on this manifold have used piecewise linear models to describe the entire state space, but it is unknown how a single, global dynamical model can generate the observed dynamics. Here, we propose a control framework to achieve such a global model of the dynamics, whereby underlying linear dynamics is actuated by sparse control signals. This method learns the control signals in an unsupervised way from data, then uses $\textit{ Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control}$ (DMDc) to create the first global, linear dynamical system that can reconstruct whole-brain imaging data. These control signals are shown to be implicated in transitions between behaviors. In addition, we analyze the time-delay encoding of these control signals, showing that these transitions can be predicted from neurons previously implicated in behavioral transitions, but also additional neurons previously unidentified. Moreover, our decomposition method allows one to understand the observed nonlinear global dynamics instead as linear dynamics with control. The proposed mathematical framework is generic and can be generalized to other neurosensory systems, potentially revealing transitions and their encodings in a completely unsupervised way.",2020-01-23T02:37:34Z,2020-04-13T21:33:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08346v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08346v3,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.NC"
Cyclic Prefix Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Capacity Analysis,"Brent A. Kenney, Stephen N. Jenkins, Arslan J. Majid, Hussein Moradi, Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny","Cyclic Prefix Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (CP-DSSS) is a novel waveform that is proposed as a solution to massive machine type communications (mMTC) for 5G and beyond. This paper analyzes the capacity of CP-DSSS in comparison with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). We show that CP-DSSS achieves the same capacity as OFDM and can be optimized with similar precoding methods (e.g., water-filling). Because of its spread spectrum nature, CP-DSSS can operate as secondary network using the same spectrum as the primary 4G or 5G network, but transmitting at much lower power. Accordingly, the combination of primary and secondary signals in the envisioned setup may be viewed as a power NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) technique where primary signals are detected and subtracted from the received signal first before detecting the secondary signals. In order to operate at a sufficiently low interference level to the primary network, details of CP-DSSS capacity for symbol rate reduction and multi-antenna operation are developed. The capacity limits established in this paper can be used as a baseline to evaluate the performance of future CP-DSSS receiver architectures for single- and multi-user scenarios.",2020-03-19T06:50:34Z,2020-03-19T06:50:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08599v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08599v1,eess.SP
DeepReceiver: A Deep Learning-Based Intelligent Receiver for Wireless   Communications in the Physical Layer,"Shilian Zheng, Shichuan Chen, Xiaoniu Yang","A canonical wireless communication system consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The information bit stream is transmitted after coding, modulation, and pulse shaping. Due to the effects of radio frequency (RF) impairments, channel fading, noise and interference, the signal arriving at the receiver will be distorted. The receiver needs to recover the original information from the distorted signal. In this paper, we propose a new receiver model, namely DeepReceiver, that uses a deep neural network to replace the traditional receiver's entire information recovery process. We design a one-dimensional convolution DenseNet (1D-Conv-DenseNet) structure, in which global pooling is used to improve the adaptability of the network to different input signal lengths. Multiple binary classifiers are used at the final classification layer to achieve multi-bit information stream recovery. We also exploit the DeepReceiver for unified blind reception of multiple modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) by including signal samples of corresponding MCSs in the training set. Simulation results show that the proposed DeepReceiver performs better than traditional step-by-step serial hard decision receiver in terms of bit error rate under the influence of various factors such as noise, RF impairments, multipath fading, cochannel interference, dynamic environment, and unified reception of multiple MCSs.",2020-03-31T11:58:29Z,2020-08-29T00:38:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14124v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14124v2,eess.SP
Asymptotically Optimal Blind Calibration of Uniform Linear Sensor Arrays   for Narrowband Gaussian Signals,"Amir Weiss, Arie Yeredor","An asymptotically optimal blind calibration scheme of uniform linear arrays for narrowband Gaussian signals is proposed. Rather than taking the direct Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for joint estimation of all the unknown model parameters, which leads to a multi-dimensional optimization problem with no closed-form solution, we revisit Paulraj and Kailath's (P-K's) classical approach in exploiting the special (Toeplitz) structure of the observations' covariance. However, we offer a substantial improvement over P-K's ordinary Least Squares (LS) estimates by using asymptotic approximations in order to obtain simple, non-iterative, (quasi-)linear Optimally-Weighted LS (OWLS) estimates of the sensors gains and phases offsets with asymptotically optimal weighting, based only on the empirical covariance matrix of the measurements. Moreover, we prove that our resulting estimates are also asymptotically optimal w.r.t. the raw data, and can therefore be deemed equivalent to the ML Estimates (MLE), which are otherwise obtained by joint ML estimation of all the unknown model parameters. After deriving computationally convenient expressions of the respective Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds, we also show that our estimates offer improved performance when applied to non-Gaussian signals (and/or noise) as quasi-MLE in a similar setting. The optimal performance of our estimates is demonstrated in simulation experiments, with a considerable improvement (reaching an order of magnitude and more) in the resulting mean squared errors w.r.t. P-K's ordinary LS estimates. We also demonstrate the improved accuracy in a multiple-sources directions-of-arrivals estimation task.",2020-08-30T05:13:37Z,2020-08-30T05:13:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13091v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13091v1,eess.SP
Transient Classification in low SNR Gravitational Wave data using Deep   Learning,"Rahul Nigam, Amit Mishra, Pranath Reddy","The recent advances in Gravitational-wave astronomy have greatly accelerated the study of Multimessenger astrophysics. There is a need for the development of fast and efficient algorithms to detect non-astrophysical transients and noises due to the rate and scale at which the data is being provided by LIGO and other gravitational wave observatories. These transients and noises can interfere with the study of gravitational waves and binary mergers and induce false positives. Here, we propose the use of deep learning algorithms to detect and classify these transient signals. Traditional statistical methods are not well designed for dealing with temporal signals but supervised deep learning techniques such as RNN-LSTM and deep CNN have proven to be effective for solving problems such as time-series forecasting and time-series classification. We also use unsupervised models such as Total variation, Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Wavelet decomposition or Random Forests for feature extraction and noise reduction and then study the results obtained by RNN-LSTM and deep CNN for classifying the transients in low-SNR signals. We compare the results obtained by the combination of various unsupervised models and supervised models. This method can be extended to real-time detection of transients and merger signals using deep-learning optimized GPU's for early prediction and study of various astronomical events. We will also explore and compare other machine learning models such as MLP, Stacked Autoencoder, Random forests, extreme learning machine, Support Vector machine and logistic regression classifier.",2020-09-20T16:15:39Z,2020-09-20T16:15:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12168v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12168v1,eess.SP
Real-time video streaming in vivo using ultrasound as the communication   channel,"Zhengchang Kou, Rita J. Miller, Andrew C. Singer, Michael L. Oelze","The emergence of capsule endoscopy has provided a means of capturing video of the small intestines without having to resort to an invasive procedure involving intubation. However, real-time video streaming to a receiver outside the body remains challenging for capsule endoscopy. Traditional electromagnetic-based solutions are limited in their data rates and available power. Recently, ultrasound was investigated as a communication channel for through-tissue data transmission. To achieve real-time video streaming through tissue, data rates of ultrasound need to exceed 1 Mbps. In a previous study, we demonstrated ultrasound communications with data rates greater than 30 Mbps with two focused ultrasound transducers using a large footprint laboratory system through slabs of lossy tissues [1]. While the form factor of the transmitter is also crucial for capsule endoscopy, it is obvious that a large, focused transducer cannot fit within the size of a capsule. Several other challenges for achieving high-speed ultrasonic communication through tissue include strong reflections leading to multipath effects and attenuation. In this work, we demonstrate ultrasonic video communications using a mm-scale microcrystal transmitter with video streaming supplied by a camera connected to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The signals were transmitted through a tissue-mimicking phantom and through the abdomen of a rabbit in vivo. The ultrasound signal was recorded by an array probe connected to a Verasonics Vantage system and decoded back to video. To improve the received signal quality, we combined the signal from multiple channels of the array probe.

Integrity-Based Path Planning Strategy for Urban Autonomous Vehicular   Navigation Using GPS and Cellular Signals,"Halim Lee, Jiwon Seo, Zaher M. Kassas","An integrity-based path planning strategy for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) navigation in urban environments is developed. The vehicle is assumed to navigate by utilizing cellular long-term evolution (LTE) signals in addition to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Given a desired destination, an optimal path is calculated, which minimizes a cost function that considers both the horizontal protection level (HPL) and travel distance. The constraints are that (i) the ratio of nodes with faulty signals to the total nodes be lower than a maximum allowable ratio and (ii) the HPLs along each candidate path be lower than the horizontal alert limit (HAL). To predict the faults and HPL before the vehicle is driven, GPS and LTE pseudoranges along the candidate paths are generated utilizing a commercial ray-tracing software and three-dimensional (3D) terrain and building maps. Simulated pseudoranges inform the path planning algorithm about potential biases due to reflections from buildings in urban environments. Simulation results are presented showing that the optimal path produced by the proposed path planning strategy has the minimum average HPL among the candidate paths.",2020-10-08T04:44:38Z,2020-10-13T02:28:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03761v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03761v2,eess.SP
Deep Multi-task Network for Delay Estimation and Echo Cancellation,"Yi Zhang, Chengyun Deng, Shiqian Ma, Yongtao Sha, Hui Song","Echo path delay (or ref-delay) estimation is a big challenge in acoustic echo cancellation. Different devices may introduce various ref-delay in practice. Ref-delay inconsistency slows down the convergence of adaptive filters, and also degrades the performance of deep learning models due to 'unseen' ref-delays in the training set. In this paper, a multi-task network is proposed to address both ref-delay estimation and echo cancellation tasks. The proposed architecture consists of two convolutional recurrent networks (CRNNs) to estimate the echo and enhanced signals separately, as well as a fully-connected (FC) network to estimate the echo path delay. Echo signal is first predicted, and then is combined with reference signal together for delay estimation. At the end, delay compensated reference and microphone signals are used to predict the enhanced target signal. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method makes reliable delay estimation and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in inconsistent echo path delay scenarios, in terms of echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). Furthermore, a data augmentation method is studied to evaluate the model performance on different portion of synthetical data with artificially introduced ref-delay.",2020-11-04T03:31:13Z,2022-08-11T08:51:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02109v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02109v2,eess.AS
On Performance of Multiscale Sparse Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm,"Bin Li, Zhikang Jiang, Jie Chen","Computing the Sparse Fast Fourier Transform(sFFT) of a K-sparse signal of size N has emerged as a critical topic for a long time. The sFFT algorithms decrease the runtime and sampling complexity by taking advantage of the signal inherent characteristics that a large number of signals are sparse in the frequency domain(e.g., sensors, video data, audio, medical image, etc.). The first stage of sFFT is frequency bucketization through one of these filters: Dirichlet kernel filter, flat filter, aliasing filter, etc. Compared to other sFFT algorithms, the sFFT algorithms using the flat filter is more convenient and efficient because the filtered signal is concentrated both in the time domain and frequency domain. Up to now, three sFFT algorithms sFFT1.0, sFFT2.0, sFFT3.0 algorithm have been proposed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) in 2013. Still, the sFFT4.0 algorithm using the multiscale approach method has not been implemented yet. This paper will discuss this algorithm comprehensively in theory and implement it in practice. It is proved that the performance of the sFFT4.0 algorithm depends on two parameters. The runtime and sampling complexity are in direct ratio to the multiscale parameter and in inverse ratio to the extension parameter. The robustness is in direct ratio to the extension parameter and in inverse ratio to the multiscale parameter. Compared with three similar algorithms or other four types of algorithms, the sFFT4.0 algorithm has excellent runtime and sampling complexity that ten to one hundred times better than the fftw algorithm, although the robustness of the algorithm is medium.",2020-11-11T11:07:51Z,2020-11-11T11:07:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05698v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05698v1,eess.SP
A Two-Stage Radar Sensing Approach based on MIMO-OFDM Technology,"Liang Liu, Shuowen Zhang","Recently, integrating the communication and sensing functions into a common network has attracted a great amount of attention. This paper considers the advanced signal processing techniques for enabling the radar to sense the environment via the communication signals. Since the technologies of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are widely used in the legacy cellular systems, this paper proposes a two-stage signal processing approach for radar sensing in an MIMO-OFDM system, where the scattered channels caused by various targets are estimated in the first stage, and the location information of the targets is then extracted from their scattered channels in the second stage. Specifically, based on the observations that radar sensing is similar to multi-path communication in the sense that different targets scatter the signal sent by the radar transmitter to the radar receiver with various delay, and that the number of scatters is limited, we show that the OFDM-based channel training approach together with the compressed sensing technique can be utilized to estimate the scattered channels efficiently in Stage I. Moreover, to tackle the challenge arising from range resolution for sensing the location of closely spaced targets, we show that the MIMO radar technique can be leveraged in Stage II such that the radar has sufficient spatial samples to even detect the targets in close proximity based on their scattered channels. Last, numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed sensing approach which merely relies on the existing MIMO-OFDM communication techniques.",2020-11-12T02:01:53Z,2020-11-12T02:01:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06161v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06161v1,eess.SP

Light-Weight 1-D Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Mental   Task Identification and Classification Based on Single-Channel EEG,"Manali Saini, Udit Satija, Madhur Deo Upadhayay","Mental task identification and classification using single/limited channel(s) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in real-time play an important role in the design of portable brain-computer interface (BCI) and neurofeedback (NFB) systems. However, the real-time recorded EEG signals are often contaminated with noises such as ocular artifacts (OAs) and muscle artifacts (MAs), which deteriorate the hand-crafted features extracted from EEG signal, resulting inadequate identification and classification of mental tasks. Therefore, we investigate the use of recent deep learning techniques which do not require any manual feature extraction or artifact suppression step. In this paper, we propose a light-weight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) architecture for mental task identification and classification. The robustness of the proposed architecture is evaluated using artifact-free and artifact-contaminated EEG signals taken from two publicly available databases (i.e, Keirn and Aunon ($K$) database and EEGMAT ($E$) database) and in-house ($R$) database recorded using single-channel neurosky mindwave mobile 2 (MWM2) EEG headset in performing not only mental/non-mental binary task classification but also different mental/mental multi-tasks classification. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves the highest subject-independent classification accuracy of $99.7\%$ and $100\%$ for multi-class classification and pair-wise mental tasks classification respectively in database $K$. Further, the proposed architecture achieves subject-independent classification accuracy of $99\%$ and $98\%$ in database $E$ and the recorded database $R$ respectively. Comparative performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed architecture outperforms existing approaches not only in terms of classification accuracy but also in robustness against artifacts.",2020-12-12T10:50:21Z,2020-12-12T10:50:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06782v1,eess.SP

Therefore, the practical phase shift model, which can describe the difference of IRS phase shift responses for the signals with different frequencies, should be utilized in the IRS optimization for wideband and multi-band systems. In this paper, we consider an IRS-assisted multi-cell multi-band system, in which different base stations (BSs) operate at different frequency bands. We aim to jointly design the transmit beamforming of BSs and the reflection beamforming of the IRS to minimize the total transmit power subject to signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints of individual user and the practical IRS reflection model. With the aid of the practical phase shift model, the influence between the signals with different frequencies is taken into account during the design of IRS.
