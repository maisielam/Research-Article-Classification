Is Physics Sick? [In Praise of Classical Physics],Hisham Ghassib,"In this paper, it is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an organism than to a rigid structure.It is in this sense that the epithet, ""sick"", applies to it. It is argued that classical physics is a model of a healthy science, and the degree of sickness of modern physics is measured accordingly. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and physical meaning in physical theory.",2012-09-04T10:32:56Z,2012-09-04T10:32:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0592v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.0592v1,"physics.gen-ph, physics.hist-ph"

Fundamental Dilemmas in Theoretical Physics,Hisham Ghassib,"In this paper, we argue that there are foundational dilemmas in theoretical physics related to the concept of reality and the nature of mathematics in physics. Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops under the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth the problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific practice. Then, it explores the problematic relation between physical meaning and mathematics in modern physical theory, followed by a discussion of the trend of contemporary physics to replace physical principles with pure mathematical principles. Finally, it discusses the problem of logical coherence in modern physical theory. The paper emphasizes the importance of resolving these dilemmas to the proper practice of theoretical physics.",2014-05-22T07:49:09Z,2014-05-22T07:49:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5530v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.5530v1,physics.hist-ph

A common physical and mathematical origin for the analysis of the different systems brings both forms (quantum and classic) of understanding the nature mechanisms closer to each other.",2004-12-15T20:07:54Z,2004-12-15T20:07:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0412088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0412088v1,"physics.gen-ph, physics.ed-ph"

Diversity in Physics Education Research: A Decade of Inclusion and   Future Challenges,Laszlo Frazer,"Diversity has an important, multifaceted role in the success of education. I have used a corpus analysis of the first ten years of Physical Review Physics Education Research to investigate the diversity, broadly defined, of physics education research. The results show that the physics education research community has extensively investigated the diversity of physics students, especially with respect to gender. However, some less visible but still numerous groups of students are little studied. On the whole, the contents of Physical Review Physics Education Research reveals a robust research community in physics education, but there is room for growth with respect to working with different kinds of students and the interactions between student attributes and teaching methods.",2017-10-21T23:32:34Z,2017-10-21T23:32:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07863v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07863v1,physics.ed-ph

"Interplay between physics self-efficacy, calculus transfer ability, and   gender","Christopher Fischer, Jennifer Delgado, Sarah LeGresley","We present our initial work to develop an assessment of calculus proficiency in the context of introductory physics (i.e., calculus transfer to physics), including a comparison of calculus transfer ability with physics self-efficacy and how these attributes intersect with student gender. Although students demonstrated an improvement in their calculus transfer ability, most nevertheless displayed a decrease in their physics self-efficacy. Similarly, while women consistently exhibited lower physics self-efficacy than men, women demonstrated larger gains in their proficiency with calculus transfer to physics. We also discuss future work to better evaluate the interdependence of mathematics self-efficacy, physics self-efficacy, and ability to transfer calculus to physics.",2021-10-14T13:48:18Z,2021-10-14T13:48:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07364v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07364v1,physics.ed-ph
Exploring the experiences of undergraduate physics students taking a   'Teaching Physics in School' module and the effects on their intentions to   become a secondary physics teacher,Daniel Cottle,This article describes an undergraduate physics module at a university in England that places year 3 student physicists in secondary school classrooms for a semester. This is done as a way of introducing them to the occupation of secondary physics teaching using a realistic job preview approach. The module helps the undergraduate students develop their communication and professional skills and supports the physics learning of pupils in the schools where they are placed. The perceptions of the participating students toward secondary school physics teaching are then investigated. Two themes emerged from this research: The difficulty of explaining physics concepts to children and the need to make school physics enjoyable.,2023-11-10T12:25:19Z,2023-11-10T12:25:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06024v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06024v1,physics.ed-ph

"Physicists, Non Physical Topics, and Interdisciplinarity",Serge Galam,"Defining interdisciplinary physics today requires first a reformulation of what is physics today, which in turn calls for clarifying what makes a physicist. This assessment results from my forty year journey arguing and fighting to build sociophysics. My view on interdisciplinary physics has thus evolved jumping repeatedly to opposite directions before settling down to the following claim: today physics is what is done by physicists who handle a problem the ""physicist's way"". However the training of physicists should stay restricted to inert matter. Yet adding a focus on the universality of the physicist approach as a generic path to investigate a topic. Consequently, interdisciplinary physics should become a cabinet of curiosities including an incubator. The cabinet of curiosities would welcome all one shots papers related to any kind of object provided it is co-authored at least by one physicist. Otherwise the paper should uses explicitly technics from physics. In case a topic gets many papers, it would be moved to the incubator to foster the potential emergence of a new appropriate subfield of physics.

Moderate Physical Perspectivalism,Emily Adlam,"Recent developments in foundations of physics have given rise to a class of views suggesting that physically meaningful descriptions must always be relativized to a physical perspective. In this article I distinguish between strong physical perspectivalism, which maintains that all facts must be relativized to a perspective, and moderate physical perspectivalism, which maintains that all empirically meaningful descriptions must be relativized to a perspective. I argue that both scientific evidence and philosophical considerations support moderate physical perspectivalism over strong physical perspectivalism.

"Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance","Henrique Gomes, Simon Langenscheidt, Daniele Oriti","We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames.

Physics Teachers' Perceptions about Diagnostic Assessment of Students'   Physics Misconceptions: A Phenomenological Study,"Mutmainna Mutmainna, Edi Istiyono, Haryanto Haryanto, Heri Retnawati, Caly Setiawan","Misconception is the difference between a student's idea and his scientific concept. Physics learning needs to be designed by teachers to minimize misconceptions. Different diagnostic tools have been developed and used by researchers to identify student misconceptions. This study addressed to uncover the experiences of eight physics teachers on how they apply diagnostic tools to detect misconceptions experienced by students investigated through phenomenological studies. Physics teachers are invited to volunteer to participate in this research. Physics teachers involved in this research have diversity based on the period of experience teaching physics, geographical area, and the level of students faced. A semi-structured interview (duration of 40 to 60 minutes) through virtually was conducted by the author for all physics teachers involved in this study. Personal Practice Theories (PPTs) by Cornett was chosen as a framework to reveal the experiences and perspectives of physics teachers in making judgments about students' misconceptions of Physics. The findings revealed that four themes were obtained. These themes are (1) personal experiences of Physics teachers, (2) Physics teachers' knowledge, (3) practices in assessing Physics misconceptions, and (4) teachers' reflections on future assessment practice.",2025-01-10T08:07:07Z,2025-01-10T08:07:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10422v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10422v1,physics.ed-ph
2T-Physics 2001,Itzhak Bars,"The physics that is traditionally formulated in one--time-physics (1T-physics) can also be formulated in two-time-physics (2T-physics). The physical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetime formalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extra dimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest many hidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of apparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically describe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two timelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out spacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The gauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a spacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is a unification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and relationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for the presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure. 2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of 1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the unified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In these lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory formulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results obtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.",2001-06-02T19:19:51Z,2001-08-29T23:41:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0106021v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0106021v3,hep-th
In a physics curriculum only introductory physics course grades show   gender differences but do not predict future course performance for physics   majors,"Kyle M. Whitcomb, Chandralekha Singh","Analysis of institutional data for physics majors showing predictive relationships between required mathematics and physics courses in various years is important for contemplating how the courses build on each other and whether there is need to make changes to the curriculum for the majors to strengthen these relationships. We use 15 years of institutional data at a large research university to investigate how introductory physics and mathematics courses predict male and female physics majors' performance on required advanced physics and mathematics courses. We used Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate these predictive relationships and find that among introductory and advanced physics and mathematics courses, there are gender differences in performance in favor of male students only in the introductory physics courses after controlling for high school GPA. We found that a measurement invariance fully holds in a multi-group SEM by gender, so it was possible to carry out analysis with gender mediated by introductory physics and high school GPA. Moreover, we find that these introductory physics courses that have gender differences do not predict performance in advanced physics courses. Also, introductory mathematics courses predict performance in advanced mathematics courses which in turn predict performance in advanced physics courses. Furthermore, apart from the introductory physics courses that do not predict performance in future physics courses, there is a strong predictive relationship between the sophomore, junior and senior level physics courses.",2019-11-25T22:42:09Z,2019-11-25T22:42:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11262v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11262v1,physics.ed-ph
Community of Practice: A framework for understanding identity   development within informal physics programs,"Claudia Fracchiolla, Brean Prefontaine, Kathleen Hinko","Studies on physics identity have shown that it is one of the main factors that can predict a person's persistence in the field; therefore, studying physics identity is critical to increase diversity within the field of physics and to understand what changes can allow more women and minorities to identify with the field. In this study, we investigate informal physics programs as spaces for physics identity exploration. These programs provide unique conditions under which to study physics identity development along with other identities. Informal physics spaces allow for voluntary engagement, as well as elements of agency and autonomy within the exploration of physics. Thus these spaces allow an identity to form outside of the constraints traditionally found in academic settings. In this work, we operationalized the Community of Practice (CoP) framework to study the development of physics identities within university students who facilitate informal physics programs. We present the stories from two physics graduate students out of our sample to provide a context for testing the feasibility of the extended framework and to identify how experiences within an informal physics program can shape physics identity development. This paper presents the operationalized constructs within the Community of Practice framework, how these constructs are applied to the narrated experiences of our participants, and highlights how we can use this framework to understand the nuances of physics identity development as well as the factors that can influence that development.",2020-06-23T12:21:07Z,2020-06-23T12:21:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12934v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12934v1,physics.ed-ph

How the physics culture shapes the experiences of undergraduate women   physics majors: A comparative case study of three physics departments,"Lisabeth Marie Santana, Chandralekha Singh","We present comparative case study of three physics department culture from different institutions using the experiences undergraduate women. The three studies conducted in the United States include Johnson's 2020 study in a small physics department at a small predominantly White liberal arts college, Santana and Singh's 2023 study at a large predominantly White research institution, and Santana and Singh's 2024 study in a medium-sized physics department at a small predominantly White private liberal arts college. Using synergistic frameworks such as Standpoint Theory, Domains of Power, and the Holistic Ecosystem for Learning Physics in an Inclusive and Equitable Environment and reflections from undergraduate women, we aim to understand how those in the position of power, e.g., instructors, have important roles in establishing and maintaining safe, equitable, and inclusive environments for undergraduate students. Their accounts help us contrast the experiences of undergraduate women in physics departments with very different cultures. This comparative analysis is especially important for reflecting upon what can be done to improve the physics culture so that historically marginalized students such as women and ethnic and racial minority students in physics feel supported and thrive. In particular, this comparative case study can be invaluable to understand the positive and negative aspects of the physics culture as they impact undergraduate women majoring in physics within these three departments. This analysis can help other physics departments contemplate strategies to improve the physics culture so that all undergraduate physics majors have validating experiences while navigating their physics journey regardless of their identities.",2024-07-17T20:23:40Z,2024-07-17T20:23:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12995v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12995v1,physics.ed-ph
"Lorentz Harmonics, Squeeze Harmonics, and their Physical Applications","Young S. Kim, Marilyn E. Noz","Among the symmetries in physics, the rotation symmetry is most familiar to us. It is known that the spherical harmonics serve useful purposes when the world is rotated. Squeeze transformations are also becoming more prominent in physics, particularly in optical sciences and in high-energy physics. As can be seen from Dirac's light-cone coordinate system, Lorentz boosts are squeeze transformations. Thus the squeeze transformation is one of the fundamental transformations in Einstein's Lorentz-covariant world. It is possible to define a complete set of orthonormal functions defined for one Lorentz frame. It is shown that the same set can be used for other Lorentz frames. Transformation properties are discussed. Physical applications are discussed in both optics and high-energy physics. It is shown that the Lorentz harmonics provide the mathematical basis for squeezed states of light. It is shown also that the same set of harmonics can be used for understanding Lorentz-boosted hadrons in high-energy physics. It is thus possible to transmit physics from one branch of physics to the other branch using the mathematical basis common to them.",2011-02-19T16:46:29Z,2011-02-19T16:46:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4000v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.4000v1,"math-ph, hep-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"
What is interdisciplinarity?

This work is guided by prior research into introductory physics for life-science (IPLS) courses, but attends to significant differences in the scope and context of this course. We interviewed enrolled students, physics professors, and professors from non-physics disciplines to explore the function of this course and the role of physics in the education of non-physics-science students. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, then analyzed to identify emergent themes. These themes outline the authentic physics, including content knowledge and other, broader learning objectives, that play an important and distinct role in the science education of enrolled students. Stakeholders generally align in their emphasis of interdisciplinary relevance with some divergence in the specific articulation of that idea. The differences can be understood through the stakeholders' distinct areas of expertise, with non-physics professors expressing value through relevance to their discipline and physics professors focusing on essential aspects of physics.",2020-05-11T18:09:48Z,2020-05-11T18:09:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05360v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05360v1,physics.ed-ph
Why Are There So Few Women in Physics? Reflections on the Experiences of   Two Women,"Danny Doucette, Chandralekha Singh","Some of the reasons for the underrepresentation of women in physics are evident in the reflections of two undergraduate women. Leia is a chemistry major who loves college-level physical chemistry and quantum mechanics but does not identify with the discipline of physics, partly because she has a low level of self-efficacy as a physicist and has received very little recognition for her work and learning in physics. Paulette is a physics major who loves physics but feels isolated by the current physics learning environment. She reluctantly dropped honors introductory lab after being snubbed by her male classmates who partnered with one another, leaving her to work alone. Paulette's experiences with condescending male professors activated a stereotype threat about who can succeed in physics that caused her to disengage in class. We also discuss what these women felt has helped them so far and explore their suggestions for what would help women in physics courses as they pursue their quest for a physical science degree.",2020-05-19T03:01:55Z,2020-05-19T03:01:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09181v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09181v1,physics.ed-ph

We make inferences on Indias contribution to different branches of Physics and identify the most influential Indian physicists at different time periods. The relative contribution of India to global physics publication(research) and its variation across subfields of Physics is assessed. We extract the changing collaboration pattern of authors between Indian physicists through various network measures. We study the evolution of Indian physics communities and trace the mean life and stationarity of communities by size in different APS journals. We map the transition of authors between communities of different sizes from 1970 to 2013, capturing their birth, growth, merger and collapse. We find that Indian-Foreign collaborations are increasing at a faster pace compared to the Indian-Indian. We observe that the degree distribution of Indian collaboration networks follows the power law, with distinct patterns between Physical Review A, B and E, and high energy physics journals Physical Review C and D, and Physical Review Letters.

Physics-Based Task Generation through Causal Sequence of Physical   Interactions,"Chathura Gamage, Vimukthini Pinto, Matthew Stephenson, Jochen Renz","Performing tasks in a physical environment is a crucial yet challenging problem for AI systems operating in the real world. Physics simulation-based tasks are often employed to facilitate research that addresses this challenge. In this paper, first, we present a systematic approach for defining a physical scenario using a causal sequence of physical interactions between objects. Then, we propose a methodology for generating tasks in a physics-simulating environment using these defined scenarios as inputs. Our approach enables a better understanding of the granular mechanics required for solving physics-based tasks, thereby facilitating accurate evaluation of AI systems' physical reasoning capabilities. We demonstrate our proposed task generation methodology using the physics-based puzzle game Angry Birds and evaluate the generated tasks using a range of metrics, including physical stability, solvability using intended physical interactions, and accidental solvability using unintended solutions. We believe that the tasks generated using our proposed methodology can facilitate a nuanced evaluation of physical reasoning agents, thus paving the way for the development of agents for more sophisticated real-world applications.",2023-08-05T10:15:18Z,2023-08-16T16:51:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02835v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02835v2,cs.AI

On the Conservation of Physical Quantities,D. M. Snyder,"Certain transformations of isolated physical systems underlying various conservation laws in physics are noted.

The conservation laws based on the transformations noted are theoretical or mental in nature to the same extent that they are physical. When one of the conservation principles noted is tested by carrying out the relevant transformation on the system, this test is essentially one of the influence of mental activity on physical reality.",1999-11-10T04:48:27Z,1999-11-10T04:48:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9911013v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9911013v1,physics.gen-ph

Using math in physics -- 4. Toy models,Edward F. Redish,"Learning to create, use, and evaluate models is a central element of becoming a scientist. In physics, we often begin an analysis of a complex system with highly simplified or toy models. In introductory physics classes, we tend to use them without comment or motivation. Some students infer that physics is irrelevant to their understanding of the real world and are discouraged from making the cognitive blend of physics concepts with math symbology essential for making sense of physics. In this paper, I discuss the often hidden barriers that make it difficult for our students to accept and understand the value of toy models, and suggest instructional approaches that can help.",2020-11-10T14:40:07Z,2020-11-10T14:40:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12700v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12700v1,physics.ed-ph

Lessons from failures to achieve what was possible in the twentieth   century physics,Vesselin Petkov,"For several decades there has been no breakthrough in fundamental physics as revolutionary as relativity and quantum physics despite the amazing advancement of applied physics and technology. By discussing several examples of what physics could have achieved by now, but failed, I will argue that the present state of fundamental physics is not caused by the lack of talented physicists, but rather by problematic general views on how one should do physics. Although it appears to be widely believed that such general views cannot affect the advancement of physics I would like to draw the attention of the younger generation of physicists to three reasons that might have been responsible for failures in the past and might cause problems in the future: (i) misconceptions on the nature of physical theories, (ii) underestimation of the role of conceptual analyses so successfully employed by Galileo and Einstein, and (iii) overestimation of the predictive power of mathematics in physics.",2010-01-24T02:36:40Z,2010-01-24T02:36:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4218v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.4218v1,"physics.hist-ph, gr-qc"

Analysing the Competency of Mathematical Modelling in Physics,Edward F. Redish,"A primary goal of physics is to create mathematical models that allow both predictions and explanations of physical phenomena. We weave maths extensively into our physics instruction beginning in high school, and the level and complexity of the maths we draw on grows as our students progress through a physics curriculum. Despite much research on the learning of both physics and math, the problem of how to successfully teach most of our students to use maths in physics effectively remains unsolved. A fundamental issue is that in physics, we don't just use maths, we think about the physical world with it. As a result, we make meaning with math-ematical symbology in a different way than mathematicians do. In this talk we analyze how developing the competency of mathematical modeling is more than just ""learning to do math"" but requires learning to blend physical meaning into mathematical representations and use that physical meaning in solving problems. Examples are drawn from across the curriculum.",2016-04-11T14:10:01Z,2016-04-11T14:10:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02966v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02966v1,physics.ed-ph

The golden age of Calcutta physics: Difficulties in reconstructing the   history,Arnab Rai Choudhuri,"Classes started in the newly established Physics Department of Calcutta University Science College in 1916. Raman, Bose and Saha were three young members of the small physics faculty consisting of barely half a dozen faculty members. Within about one decade, three extraordinary discoveries came from these young men---Saha ionization equation in 1920, Bose statistics in 1924, Raman effect in 1928. However, fortunes of Calcutta University quickly got intertwined with India's freedom struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi exactly at the same time and the physics group got tragically disrupted.

A single photonic cavity with two independent physical synthetic   dimensions,"Avik Dutt, Qian Lin, Luqi Yuan, Momchil Minkov, Meng Xiao, Shanhui Fan","The concept of synthetic dimensions, which has enabled the study of higher-dimensional physics on lower-dimensional physical structures, has generated significant recent interest in many branches of science ranging from ultracold-atomic physics to photonics, since such a concept provides a versatile platform for realizing effective gauge potentials and novel topological physics. Previous experiments demonstrating this concept have augmented the real-space dimensionality by one additional physical synthetic dimension. Here we endow a single ring resonator with two independent physical synthetic dimensions. Our system consists of a temporally modulated ring resonator with spatial coupling between the clockwise and counterclockwise modes, creating a synthetic Hall ladder along the frequency and pseudospin degrees of freedom for photons propagating in the ring. We experimentally observe a wide variety of rich physics, including effective spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fields, spin-momentum locking, a Meissner-to-vortex phase transition, and chiral currents, completely in synthetic dimensions. Our experiments demonstrate that higher-dimensional physics can be studied in simple systems by leveraging the concept of multiple simultaneous synthetic dimensions.",2019-09-11T02:37:27Z,2019-09-11T02:37:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04828v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04828v1,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.quant-gas, physics.atom-ph, quant-ph"
Teaching gauge theory to first year students,Nils-Erik Bomark,"One of the biggest revelations of 20th century physics, is virtually unheard of outside the inner circles of particle physics. This is the gauge theory, the foundation for how all physical interactions are described and a guiding principle for almost all work on new physics theories. Is it not our duty as physicists to try and spread this knowledge to a wider audience?   Here, two simple gauge theory models are presented that should be understandable without any advanced mathematics or physics and it is demonstrated how they can be used to show how gauge symmetries are used to construct the standard model of particle physics. This is also used to describe the real reason we need the Higgs field.   Though these concepts are complicated and abstract, it seems possible for at least first year students to understand the main ideas. Since they typically are very interested in cutting edge physics, they do appreciate the effort and enjoy the more detail insight into modern particle physics. These results are certainly encouraging more efforts in this direction.",2020-09-04T12:53:26Z,2020-09-07T11:31:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02162v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02162v2,"physics.ed-ph, hep-ex, hep-ph, physics.hist-ph"

First it is proven that there cannot be a physical computer C to which one can pose any and all computational tasks concerning the physical universe. Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly carry out any computational task in the subset of such tasks that can be posed to C. As a particular example, this means that there cannot be a physical computer that can, for any physical system external to that computer, take the specification of that external system's state as input and then correctly predict its future state before that future state actually occurs. The results also mean that there cannot exist an infallible, general-purpose observation apparatus, and that there cannot be an infallible, general-purpose control apparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are infinite, and/or non-classical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They also hold even if one uses an infinitely fast, infinitely dense computer, with computational powers greater than that of a Turing Machine.",2000-05-23T00:51:11Z,2000-05-23T00:51:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0005058v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0005058v1,"physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.CC, math-ph, math.MP, physics.gen-ph"
Heuristic rule for constructing physics axiomatization,Florin Moldoveanu,"Constructing the Theory of Everything (TOE) is an elusive goal of today's physics. Goedel's incompleteness theorem seems to forbid physics axiomatization, a necessary part of the TOE. The purpose of this contribution is to show how physics axiomatization can be achieved guided by a new heuristic rule. This will open up new roads into constructing the ultimate theory of everything. Three physical principles will be identified from the heuristic rule and they in turn will generate uniqueness results of various technical strengths regarding space, time, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics, electroweak symmetry and the dimensionality of space-time. The hope is that the strong force and the Standard Model axiomatizations are not too far out. Quantum gravity and cosmology are harder problems and maybe new approaches are needed. However, complete physics axiomatization seems to be an achievable goal, no longer part of philosophical discussions, but subject to rigorous mathematical proofs.",2010-01-26T03:16:53Z,2010-01-26T03:16:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4586v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.4586v1,"physics.hist-ph, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"

Information-Based Physics: An Observer-Centric Foundation,Kevin H. Knuth,"It is generally believed that physical laws, reflecting an inherent order in the universe, are ordained by nature. However, in modern physics the observer plays a central role raising questions about how an observer-centric physics can result in laws apparently worthy of a universal nature-centric physics. Over the last decade, we have found that the consistent apt quantification of algebraic and order-theoretic structures results in calculi that possess constraint equations taking the form of what are often considered to be physical laws. I review recent derivations of the formal relations among relevant variables central to special relativity, probability theory and quantum mechanics in this context by considering a problem where two observers form consistent descriptions of and make optimal inferences about a free particle that simply influences them. I show that this approach to describing such a particle based only on available information leads to the mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics as well as a description of a free particle that reproduces many of the basic properties of a fermion. The result is an approach to foundational physics where laws derive from both consistent descriptions and optimal information-based inferences made by embedded observers.",2013-10-07T04:00:19Z,2013-10-07T04:00:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1667v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.1667v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"
How device-independent approaches change the meaning of physical theory,Alexei Grinbaum,"Dirac sought an interpretation of mathematical formalism in terms of physical entities and Einstein insisted that physics should describe ""the real states of the real systems"". While Bell inequalities put into question the reality of states, modern device-independent approaches do away with the idea of entities: physical theory may contain no physical systems. Focusing on the correlations between operationally defined inputs and outputs, device-independent methods promote a view more distant from the conventional one than Einstein's 'principle theories' were from 'constructive theories'. On the examples of indefinite causal orders and almost quantum correlations, we ask a puzzling question: if physical theory is not about systems, then what is it about? The answer given by the device-independent models is that physics is about languages. In moving away from the information-theoretic reconstructions of quantum theory, this answer marks a new conceptual development in the foundations of physics.",2015-12-03T11:08:07Z,2016-05-31T13:28:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01035v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01035v3,"quant-ph, physics.soc-ph"

We review in a selective way the recent research on the interface between machine learning and physical sciences. This includes conceptual developments in machine learning (ML) motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross-fertilization between the two fields. After giving basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, we describe examples of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML.

Physics-Informed Multi-LSTM Networks for Metamodeling of Nonlinear   Structures,"Ruiyang Zhang, Yang Liu, Hao Sun","This paper introduces an innovative physics-informed deep learning framework for metamodeling of nonlinear structural systems with scarce data. The basic concept is to incorporate physics knowledge (e.g., laws of physics, scientific principles) into deep long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which boosts the learning within a feasible solution space. The physics constraints are embedded in the loss function to enforce the model training which can accurately capture latent system nonlinearity even with very limited available training datasets. Specifically for dynamic structures, physical laws of equation of motion, state dependency and hysteretic constitutive relationship are considered to construct the physics loss. In particular, two physics-informed multi-LSTM network architectures are proposed for structural metamodeling. The satisfactory performance of the proposed framework is successfully demonstrated through two illustrative examples (e.g., nonlinear structures subjected to ground motion excitation). It turns out that the embedded physics can alleviate overfitting issues, reduce the need of big training datasets, and improve the robustness of the trained model for more reliable prediction. As a result, the physics-informed deep learning paradigm outperforms classical non-physics-guided data-driven neural networks.",2020-02-18T10:35:02Z,2020-02-18T10:35:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10253v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10253v1,"cs.CE, eess.SP"
How learning environment predicts male and female students' physics   motivational beliefs in introductory physics courses,"Yangqiuting Li, Kyle Whitcomb, Chandralekha Singh","In this study, we adapt prior identity framework to investigate the effect of learning environment (including perceived recognition, peer interaction and sense of belonging) on students' physics self-efficacy, interest and identity by controlling for their self-efficacy and interest at the beginning of a calculus-based introductory physics course. We surveyed 1203 students, 35% of whom were women. We found that female students' physics self-efficacy and interest were lower than male students' at the beginning of the course, and the gender gaps in these motivational constructs became even larger by the end of the course. Analysis revealed that the decrease in students' physics self-efficacy and interest were mediated by the learning environment and ultimately affected students' physics identity. Our model shows that perceived recognition played a major role in explaining students' physics identity, and students' sense of belonging in physics played an important role in explaining the change in students' physics self-efficacy.",2020-07-15T02:32:10Z,2020-07-15T02:32:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07441v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07441v1,physics.ed-ph
The Role of Flavor Physics in the LHC Era,Stephen Lars Olsen,"Although searches for new physics at the CERN Large Hadron Collider will probably dominate the the agenda of the experimental high energy physics community during the next decade or more, high-intensity experiments at the tau-charm and beauty thresholds will continue to play important complementary roles. These include the establishment of stringent constraints on proposed theories for beyond-the-Standard-Model physics and unique opportunities to address some new physics scenarios that are inaccessible at the LHC. In addition, in the event that the LHC does discover some new phenomena, high sensitivity flavor physics measurements could provide diagnostic clues as to the physics processes responsible for the observed effects. In this talk I present a few examples that illustrate the close inter-relation of new physics searches at the high-energy frontier and high-sensitivity measurements at the intensity frontier.",2014-09-01T00:45:19Z,2014-09-02T07:21:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0273v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0273v2,"hep-ex, hep-ph, nucl-ex"
Physical Integrity Attack Detection of Surveillance Camera with Deep   Learning Based Video Frame Interpolation,Jonathan Pan,"Surveillance cameras, which is a form of Cyber Physical System, are deployed extensively to provide visual surveillance monitoring of activities of interest or anomalies. However, these cameras are at risks of physical security attacks against their physical attributes or configuration like tampering of their recording coverage, camera positions or recording configurations like focus and zoom factors. Such adversarial alteration of physical configuration could also be invoked through cyber security attacks against the camera's software vulnerabilities to administratively change the camera's physical configuration settings. When such Cyber Physical attacks occur, they affect the integrity of the targeted cameras that would in turn render these cameras ineffective in fulfilling the intended security functions. There is a significant measure of research work in detection mechanisms of cyber-attacks against these Cyber Physical devices, however it is understudied area with such mechanisms against integrity attacks on physical configuration. This research proposes the use of the novel use of deep learning algorithms to detect such physical attacks originating from cyber or physical spaces. Additionally, we proposed the novel use of deep learning-based video frame interpolation for such detection that has comparatively better performance to other anomaly detectors in spatiotemporal environments.",2019-06-15T05:48:29Z,2019-06-15T05:48:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06475v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06475v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI"
A Conceptual Blend Analysis of Physics Quantitative Literacy Reasoning   Inventory Items,"Suzanne White Brahmia, Alexis Olsho, Andrew Boudreaux, Trevor Smith, Charlotte Zimmerman","Mathematical reasoning flexibility across physics contexts is a desirable learning outcome of introductory physics, where the math world and physical world meet. Physics Quantitative Literacy (PQL) is a set of interconnected skills and habits of mind that support quantitative reasoning about the physical world. The Physics Inventory of Quantitative Literacy (PIQL), which we are currently refining and validating, assesses students proportional reasoning, covariational reasoning, and reasoning with signed quantities in physics contexts. In this paper, we apply a Conceptual Blending Theory analysis of two exemplar PIQL items to demonstrate how we are using this theory to help develop an instrument that represents the kind of blended reasoning that characterizes expertise in physics. A Conceptual Blending Theory analysis allows for assessment of hierarchical partially correct reasoning patterns, and thereby holds potential to map the emergence of mathematical reasoning flexibility throughout the introductory physics sequence.",2019-11-05T00:48:30Z,2019-11-05T00:48:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01552v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01552v1,physics.ed-ph
Faculty survey on upper-division thermal physics content coverage,"Katherine D. Rainey, Bethany R. Wilcox","Thermal physics is a core course requirement for most physics degrees and encompasses both thermodynamics and statistical mechanics content. However, the primary content foci of thermal physics courses vary across universities. This variation can make creation of materials or assessment tools for thermal physics difficult. To determine the scope and content variability of thermal physics courses across institutions, we distributed a survey to over 140 institutions to determine content priorities from faculty and instructors who have taught upper-division thermodynamics and/or statistical mechanics. We present results from the survey, which highlight key similarities and differences in thermal physics content coverage across institutions. Though we see variations in content coverage, we found 9 key topical areas covered by all respondents in their upper-division thermal physics courses.

The workshop was held on the 14th of July 2016 in Manchester, UK, as a satellite workshop to UCNC 2016, the 15th International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation.   The goal of the workshop series is to bring together researches working on the interaction between physics and the theory of computation. This intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour of physical systems. Instead, it looks to the the theory of computation and information to provide new insights into physical systems and processes, and, in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems. Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation.",2016-06-21T11:09:21Z,2016-06-21T11:09:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06513v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06513v1,"cs.ET, quant-ph"
Modeling student pathways in a physics bachelor's degree program,"John M. Aiken, Rachel Henderson, Marcos D. Caballero","Physics education research has used quantitative modeling techniques to explore learning, affect, and other aspects of physics education. However, these studies have rarely examined the predictive output of the models, instead focusing on the inferences or causal relationships observed in various data sets. This research introduces a modern predictive modeling approach to the PER community using transcript data for students declaring physics majors at Michigan State University (MSU). Using a machine learning model, this analysis demonstrates that students who switch from a physics degree program to an engineering degree program do not take the third semester course in thermodynamics and modern physics, and may take engineering courses while registered as a physics major. Performance in introductory physics and calculus courses, measured by grade as well as a students' declared gender and ethnicity play a much smaller role relative to the other features included the model. These results are used to compare traditional statistical analysis to a more modern modeling approach.",2018-10-26T11:31:39Z,2019-04-05T09:30:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11272v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11272v3,physics.ed-ph

Virtual experiments in this lab manual and our previous Physics I (arXiv.2012.09151) and Physics II (arXiv.2012.13278) lab manuals were designed for 2.45 hrs long lab classes (algebra-based and calculus-based). However, all the virtual labs in these three series can be easily simplified to align with conceptual type or short time physics lab classes as desired. All the virtual experiments were based on open education resource (OER) type simulations. Virtual experiments were designed to simulate in-person physical laboratory experiments.

Observing how deep neural networks understand physics through the energy   spectrum of one-dimensional quantum mechanics,Kenzo Ogure,"We investigate how neural networks (NNs) understand physics using 1D quantum mechanics. After training an NN to accurately predict energy eigenvalues from potentials, we used it to confirm the NN's understanding of physics from four different aspects. The trained NN could predict energy eigenvalues of different kinds of potentials than the ones learned, predict the probability distribution of the existence of particles not used during training, reproduce untrained physical phenomena, and predict the energy eigenvalues of potentials with an unknown matter effect. These results show that NNs can learn physical laws from experimental data, predict the results of experiments under conditions different from those used for training, and predict physical quantities of types not provided during training. Because NNs understand physics in a different way than humans, they will be a powerful tool for advancing physics by complementing the human way of understanding.",2022-01-18T00:35:28Z,2022-11-08T06:27:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06676v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06676v2,"physics.comp-ph, quant-ph, stat.ML"
A framework for characterizing covariational reasoning in physics,"Alexis Olsho, Charlotte Zimmerman, Suzanne White Brahmia","Covariational reasoning--considering how changes in one quantity affect another, related quantity--is a foundation of quantitative modeling in physics. Understanding quantitative models is a learning objective of introductory physics instruction at the college level. Prior work suggests that covariational reasoning in physics contexts differs in important ways from reasoning about functions and graphs in purely mathematical contexts; this reasoning is effortful in physics even for mathematically well-prepared students. In order to help students learn to reason covariationally in physics contexts, we need to characterize what we mean by physics covariational reasoning. To this end, we present a framework of covariational reasoning in physics contexts, to describe the ways that covariational reasoning is used in physics modeling. The framework can be used as a tool by which instructors can recognize physics covariational reasoning patterns and researchers can analyze student reasoning. The framework can also help inform the development of effective instructional materials and methods.",2023-10-10T18:58:55Z,2023-10-10T18:58:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06941v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06941v1,physics.ed-ph

Specifically, the Motion Generator is responsible for providing large-scale synthetic motion data, while the Motion Physics Refinement Module utilizes these synthetic data to train a motion imitator within a physics simulator, enforcing physical constraints to project the noisy motions into a physically-plausible space. These physically refined motions, in turn, are used to fine-tune the Motion Generator, further enhancing its capability.

In this plenary talk, delivered in slightly different forms at the {\it Particles and Nuclei International Conference} (PANIC05) in Santa Fe, in October 2005, and at the {\it CMB and Physics of the Early Universe International Conference}, on the island of Ischia, Italy, in April 2006, I discuss the broad connections between cosmology and particle physics, focusing on physics at the TeV scale, accessible at the next and future generations of colliders",2006-05-26T13:07:09Z,2006-05-26T13:07:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0605284v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0605284v1,hep-ph
Cosmology and New Physics,A. D. Dolgov,"A comparison of the standard models in particle physics and in cosmology demonstrates that they are not compatible, though both are well established. Basics of modern cosmology are briefly reviewed. It is argued that the measurements of the main cosmological parameters are achieved through many independent physical phenomena and this minimizes possible interpretation errors. It is shown that astronomy demands new physics beyond the frameworks of the (minimal) standard model in particle physics. More revolutionary modifications of the basic principles of the theory are also discussed.",2006-06-21T14:49:25Z,2006-06-21T14:49:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0606230v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0606230v1,hep-ph
Physics at LHC,John Ellis,"The prospects for physics at the LHC are discussed, starting with the foretaste, preparation (and perhaps scoop) provided by the Tevatron, in particular, and then continuing through the successive phases of LHC operation. These include the start-up phase, the early physics runs, the possible search for new physics in double diffraction, the continuation to nominal LHC running, and the possible upgrade of the LHC luminosity. Emphasis is placed on the prospects for Higgs physics and the search for supersymmetry. The progress and discoveries of the LHC will set the time-scale and agenda for the major future accelerator projects that will follow it.",2006-11-17T17:09:06Z,2006-11-17T17:09:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0611237v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0611237v1,hep-ph
Effects of Dirac's Negative Energy Sea on Quantum Numbers,R. Jackiw,"One route towards understanding both fractional charges and chiral anomalies delves into Dirac's negative energy sea. Usually we think of Dirac's negative energy sea as an unphysical construct, invented to render quantum field theory physically acceptable by hiding the negative energy solutions. I suggest that in fact physical consequences can be drawn from Dirac's construction.",1999-03-30T17:00:14Z,1999-03-30T17:00:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9903255v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9903255v1,"hep-th, hep-ph, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"
Dynamics and causality constraints,Manoelito M de Souza,"The physical meaning and the geometrical interpretation of causality implementation in classical field theories are discussed. Local causality are kinematical constraints dynamically implemented via solutions of the field equations, but in a limit of zero-distance from the field sources part of these constraints carries a dynamical content that explains old problems of classical electrodynamics away with deep implications to the nature of physical interactions.",2000-06-27T20:47:47Z,2000-09-25T19:31:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0006214v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0006214v3,"hep-th, gr-qc, hep-ph, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"
Principles of a Unified Theory of Spacetime and Physical Interactions,Yu. S. Vladimirov,"Principles of a new approach (binary geometrophysics) are presented to construct the unified theory of spacetime and the familiar kinds of physical interactions. Physically, the approach is a modified S-matrix theory involving ideas of the multidimensional geometric models of physical interactions of Kaluza-Klein's type as well as Fokker-Feynman's action-at-a-distance theory. Mathematically, this is a peculiar binary geometry being described in algebraic terms. In the present approach the binary geometry volume is a prototype of three related notions: the S-matrix, the physical action (Lagrangian) of both strong and electroweak interactions, and the multidimensional metric. A transition from microworld geometrophysics to the conventional physical theory in classical spacetime are characterized.",2001-11-02T14:21:14Z,2001-11-02T14:21:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0111021v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0111021v1,hep-th

Making sense of Physics in the first year of study,"Shirley Booth, Ake Ingerman","We address the question ""How do students make sense of Physics from the point of view of constituting physics knowledge?"". A phenomenographic study is described as a result of which we present six qualitatively different ways in which students experience the first year of Physics. The variation is analysed in terms of the structure of experience, the nature of knowlege and an ethical aspect related to the identification of authority. Three of these ways of experiencing the first year are considered to be unproductive in terms of making sense of physics, while the other three support, to an increasing degree, the formation of a well-grounded physics knowledge object. Implications for practice are considered.",1999-11-26T16:47:19Z,1999-11-26T16:47:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9911071v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9911071v1,physics.ed-ph
"Fiber Bundle Gauge Theories and ""Field's Dilemma""","Yair Guttmann, Holger Lyre","We propose a distinction between the physical and the mathematical parts of gauge field theories. The main problem we face is to uphold a strong and meaningful criterion of what is physical. We like to call it ""Field's dilemma"", referring to Hartry Field's nominalist proposal which we consider to be inadaequate. The resolution to the dilemma, we believe, is implicitly provided by the so-called fiber bundle formalism. We shall demonstrate, in detail, that the bundle structure underlying modern quantum and gravitational gauge field theories allows for a genuine distinction between the physically significant and the merely mathematical parts of these theories.",2000-05-19T20:31:45Z,2000-05-19T20:31:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0005051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0005051v1,"physics.hist-ph, gr-qc, hep-th, physics.gen-ph, quant-ph"

Physics Education Research: Or it's so hard to find good help these days,Sanjoy Mahajan,"Physics education research (PER) aims to improve how students solve problems. But whose problems are we teaching students to solve? Physics has grown up as a child of war, and PER stems from the cognitive revolution in psychology, which arose from military needs and funding.

Majorana and the path-integral approach to Quantum Mechanics,S. Esposito,"We give, for the first time, the English translation of a manuscript by Ettore Majorana, which probably corresponds to the text for a seminar delivered at the University of Naples in 1938, where he lectured on Theoretical Physics.

In particular, it is shown that the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction effects which naively follow from space-time symmetry of the Lorentz transformation do not occur.

Complementarity: Flavor Physics in the LHC Era,A. J. Schwartz,"The LHC physics era is about to commence; here we discuss a complementary physics program that would be realized at a high luminosity flavor factory.

Geometry of Grand Unification,Cumrun Vafa,"Grand Unification of all forces has been a well motivated paradigm for particle physics. This subject has been recently revisited in the context of string theory, leading to a geometric reformulation of the idea of unification of forces.

Physics Guided RNNs for Modeling Dynamical Systems: A Case Study in   Simulating Lake Temperature Profiles,"Xiaowei Jia, Jared Willard, Anuj Karpatne, Jordan Read, Jacob Zwart, Michael Steinbach, Vipin Kumar","This paper proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improve the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physical models, while generating outputs consistent with physical laws, and achieving good generalizability. Standard RNNs, even when producing superior prediction accuracy, often produce physically inconsistent results and lack generalizability. We further enhance this approach by using a pre-training method that leverages the simulated data from a physics-based model to address the scarcity of observed data. The PGRNN has the flexibility to incorporate additional physical constraints and we incorporate a density-depth relationship. Both enhancements further improve PGRNN performance. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where mechanistic (also known as process-based) models are used, e.g., power engineering, climate science, materials science, computational chemistry, and biomedicine.",2018-10-31T02:21:19Z,2019-01-31T00:11:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13075v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.13075v2,"physics.comp-ph, cs.AI"

The role physics can play in a multi-disciplinary curriculum for   non-physics scientists and engineers,"Edward F. Redish, Vashti Sawtelle, Chandra Turpen","At many physics departments a significant fraction of teaching is in support of engineers and scientists in other majors. These service courses are thus an automatic crucible of interdisciplinary interaction, and at times, strife. For example, the traditional algebra-based physics course is often considered by both biology faculty and students as having little relevance to their discipline. To address this issue, our multi-disciplinary multi-university team has been negotiating the role of a physics in the curriculum of life-science students; In NEXUS/Physics we have designed a class that stresses traditional physics skills but in contexts chosen to better meet the needs of life science students. Non-standard topics include chemical energy, diffusion and random motion, and thermodynamics with careful discussions of entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy.

Thermodynamics of the independent harmonic oscillators with different   frequencies in the Tsallis statistics,Masamichi Ishihara,"We study the thermodynamic quantities in the system of the $N$ independent harmonic oscillators with different frequencies in the Tsallis statistics of the entropic parameter $q$ ($1<q<2$) with escort average. The self-consistent equation is derived, and the physical quantities are calculated with the physical temperature. It is found that the number of oscillators is restricted below $1/(q-1)$. The energy, the R\'enyi entropy, and the Tsallis entropy are obtained by solving the self-consistent equation approximately at high physical temperature and/or for small deviation $q-1$. The energy is $q$-independent at high physical temperature when the physical temperature is adopted, and the energy is proportional to the number of oscillators and physical temperature at high physical temperature. The form of the R\'enyi entropy is similar to that of von-Neumann entropy, and the Tsallis entropy is given through the R\'enyi entropy. The physical temperature dependence of the Tsallis entropy is different from that of R\'enyi entropy. The Tsallis entropy is bounded from the above, while the R\'enyi entropy increases with the physical temperature. The ratio of the Tsallis entropy to the R\'enyi entropy is small at high physical temperature.",2021-09-12T06:25:30Z,2021-09-12T06:25:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05442v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05442v1,cond-mat.stat-mech

We present data from three curricular approaches over four semesters ($n=701$). We saw no change in E-CLASS scores in the first implementation of a conceptual inquiry-based introductory physics lab.

Fine-grained differentiable physics: a yarn-level model for fabrics,"Deshan Gong, Zhanxing Zhu, Andrew J. Bulpitt, He Wang","Differentiable physics modeling combines physics models with gradient-based learning to provide model explicability and data efficiency. It has been used to learn dynamics, solve inverse problems and facilitate design, and is at its inception of impact. Current successes have concentrated on general physics models such as rigid bodies, deformable sheets, etc., assuming relatively simple structures and forces. Their granularity is intrinsically coarse and therefore incapable of modelling complex physical phenomena. Fine-grained models are still to be developed to incorporate sophisticated material structures and force interactions with gradient-based learning. Following this motivation, we propose a new differentiable fabrics model for composite materials such as cloths, where we dive into the granularity of yarns and model individual yarn physics and yarn-to-yarn interactions. To this end, we propose several differentiable forces, whose counterparts in empirical physics are indifferentiable, to facilitate gradient-based learning. These forces, albeit applied to cloths, are ubiquitous in various physical systems. Through comprehensive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate our model's explicability in learning meaningful physical parameters, versatility in incorporating complex physical structures and heterogeneous materials, data-efficiency in learning, and high-fidelity in capturing subtle dynamics.",2022-02-01T16:01:01Z,2022-02-01T16:01:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00504v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00504v1,cs.LG
Controllable Evaluation and Generation of Physical Adversarial Patch on   Face Recognition,"Xiao Yang, Yinpeng Dong, Tianyu Pang, Zihao Xiao, Hang Su, Jun Zhu","Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of face recognition models against physical adversarial patches, which raises security concerns about the deployed face recognition systems. However, it is still challenging to ensure the reproducibility for most attack algorithms under complex physical conditions, which leads to the lack of a systematic evaluation of the existing methods. It is therefore imperative to develop a framework that can enable a comprehensive evaluation of the vulnerability of face recognition in the physical world. To this end, we propose to simulate the complex transformations of faces in the physical world via 3D-face modeling, which serves as a digital counterpart of physical faces. The generic framework allows us to control different face variations and physical conditions to conduct reproducible evaluations comprehensively. With this digital simulator, we further propose a Face3DAdv method considering the 3D face transformations and realistic physical variations. Extensive experiments validate that Face3DAdv can significantly improve the effectiveness of diverse physically realizable adversarial patches in both simulated and physical environments, against various white-box and black-box face recognition models.",2022-03-09T10:21:40Z,2022-03-10T03:14:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04623v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04623v2,cs.CV
Physics-aware Reduced-order Modeling of Transonic Flow via   $β$-Variational Autoencoder,"Yu-Eop Kang, Sunwoong Yang, Kwanjung Yee","Autoencoder-based reduced-order modeling (ROM) has recently attracted significant attention, owing to its ability to capture underlying nonlinear features. However, two critical drawbacks severely undermine its scalability to various physical applications: entangled and therefore uninterpretable latent variables (LVs) and the blindfold determination of latent space dimension. In this regard, this study proposes the physics-aware ROM using only interpretable and information-intensive LVs extracted by $\beta$-variational autoencoder, which are referred to as physics-aware LVs throughout this paper. To extract these LVs, their independence and information intensity are quantitatively scrutinized in a two-dimensional transonic flow benchmark problem. Then, the physical meanings of the physics-aware LVs are thoroughly investigated and we confirmed that with appropriate hyperparameter $\beta$, they actually correspond to the generating factors of the training dataset, Mach number and angle of attack. To the best of the authors' knowledge, our work is the first to practically confirm that $\beta$-variational autoencoder can automatically extract the physical generating factors in the field of applied physics. Finally, physics-aware ROM, which utilizes only physics-aware LVs, is compared with conventional ROMs, and its validity and efficiency are successfully verified.",2022-05-02T01:33:17Z,2022-06-09T06:17:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00608v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00608v2,"physics.flu-dyn, cs.LG"

In this study, we developed and piloted such a learning environment, which was implemented and piloted twice in a seminar for pre-service physics teachers. As coping with a diagnostic process is particularly demanding for pre-service physics teachers, our accompanying research aims to identify learning barriers within our developed learning environment.

Instructional Strategies that Foster Effective Problem-Solving,"Chandralekha Singh, Alexandru Maries, Kenneth Heller, Patricia Heller","Helping students become proficient problem solvers is a major goal of many physics courses from introductory to advanced levels. In fact, physics has often been used by cognitive scientists to investigate the differences between the problem-solving strategies of expert and novice problem solvers because it is a domain in which there is reasonably good agreement about what constitutes good problem-solving. Since the laws of physics are encapsulated in compact mathematical form, becoming an expert physics problem solver entails learning to unpack and interpret those physical laws as well as being able to apply them in diverse situations while solving problems. A physics expert must have a well-organized knowledge structure of relevant physics and math concepts and be able to manage cognitive load and do metacognition while solving complex problems. In this chapter, we review foundational research on expertise in physics problem-solving and then discuss research on instructional strategies that promote effective problem-solving as well as challenges in changing the instructional practices of physics instructors and teaching assistants via professional development to promote and support effective problem-solving approaches.",2023-04-12T03:10:01Z,2023-04-12T03:10:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05585v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05585v1,physics.ed-ph
When physics meets chemistry at dynamic glass transition,Haibao Lu,"Can the laws of physics be unified. One of the most puzzling challenges is to reconcile physics and chemistry, where molecular physics meets condensed-matter physics, resulting from the scaling effect and dynamic fluctuation of glassy matter at the glass transition temperature. Pioneer of condensed-matter physics, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Philip Warren Anderson, wrote in 1995: The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in condensed-matter physics is probably the theory of the nature of glassy state and the glass transition. In 2005, the question of 'what is the nature of glassy state' was suggested as one of the greatest scientific conundrums over the next quarter-century for Science's 125th anniversary. However, the nature of glassy state and its connection to the glass transition have not been fully understood owing to the interdisciplinary complexity of physics and chemistry, where they are governed by the physical laws at condensed-matter and molecular scales, respectively. Therefore, study on the glass transition becomes essential to explore the working principles of scaling effect and dynamic fluctuation in glassy matter, as well as further reconcile the interdisciplinary complexity of physics and chemistry.",2023-04-27T12:41:37Z,2023-04-27T12:41:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14147v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14147v1,cond-mat.soft

Recruiting physics lab instructors across the US, we collected 84 survey responses and conducted 12 in-depth interviews about their job characteristics, professional identities, resources, and experiences. Our investigation reveals that lab instructors vary in terms of their official titles, job descriptions, formal duties, personal agency, and access to resources. We also identified common themes around the value of instructional labs, mismatched job descriptions, and a broad set of necessary skills and expertise. Our results suggest that instructors often occupy overlapping roles that fall in between more canonical jobs in physics departments.

From Exploration to End of Life: Unpacking Sustainability in   Physicalization Practices,"Luiz Morais, Georgia Panagiotidou, Sarah Hayes, Tatiana Losev, Rebecca Noonan, Uta Hinrichs","Data physicalizations have gained prominence across domains, but their environmental impact has been largely overlooked. This work addresses this gap by investigating the interplay between sustainability and physicalization practices. We conducted interviews with experts from diverse backgrounds, followed by a survey to gather insights into how they approach physicalization projects and reflect on sustainability. Our thematic analysis revealed sustainability considerations throughout the entire physicalization life cycle -- a framework that encompasses various stages in a physicalization's existence. Notably, we found no single agreed-upon definition for sustainable physicalizations, highlighting the complexity of integrating sustainability into physicalization practices. We outline sustainability challenges and strategies based on participants' experiences and propose the Sustainable Physicalization Practices (SuPPra) Matrix, providing a structured approach for designers to reflect on and enhance the environmental impact of their future physicalizations.",2024-02-15T10:28:41Z,2024-02-15T10:28:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09860v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09860v1,"cs.HC, H.5"
Visualization for physics analysis improvement and applications in   BESIII,"Zhi-Jun Li, Ming-Kuan Yuan, Yun-Xuan Song, Yan-Gu Li, Jing-Shu Li, Sheng-Sen Sun, Xiao-Long Wang, Zheng-Yun You, Ya-Jun Mao","Modern particle physics experiments usually rely on highly complex and large-scale spectrometer devices. In high energy physics experiments, visualization helps detector design, data quality monitoring, offline data processing, and has great potential for improving physics analysis. In addition to the traditional physics data analysis based on statistical methods, visualization provides unique intuitive advantages in searching for rare signal events and reducing background noises. By applying the event display tool to several physics analyses in the BESIII experiment, we demonstrate that visualization can benefit potential physics discovery and improve the signal significance. With the development of modern visualization techniques, it is expected to play a more important role in future data processing and physics analysis of particle physics experiments.",2024-03-19T10:26:48Z,2024-07-04T16:39:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07951v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07951v2,"physics.data-an, hep-ex"
Modern physics courses: Understanding the content taught in the U.S,"Alexis Buzzell, Ramón Barthelemy, Tim Atherton","The modern physics course is a crucial gateway for physics majors, introducing concepts beyond the scope of K-12 education. Despite its significance, content varies widely among institutions. This study analyzes 167 modern physics syllabi from 127 US research intensive institutions, employing emergent coding using both human and Natural Language Processing methods from public sources (51.5%) and private correspondence (48.5%). Public course catalogs were consulted to identify pre- and co-requisites, with 37.1% of students having completed calculus II. Foundational topics like Newtonian mechanics (94%), electricity and magnetism (84.4%), and waves or optics (77.2%) were frequently required. Quantum physics (94%), atomic physics (83%), and relativity (70%) were most commonly taught. The study highlights the lack of uniformity in modern physics curricula, emphasizing the importance of a consistent and comprehensive education for physics majors across universities.

"Integrating Evolutionary Biology into Physics Classroom: Scaling,   Dimension, Form and Function","Kausik S Das, Larry Gonick, Salem Al Mosleh","Since Galileo and (more recently) D'Arcy Thompson, it has been understood that physical processes and constraints influence biological structures and their resulting functions. However these cross-discpline connections -- and their importance to growing scientific discplines such as biophysics -- are rarely tought in introductory physics courses. Here we examine how the laws of physics shape Darwinism evolution through the surface area to volume ratio, an important geometric measure of a structure. We develop conceptual cartoon clicker questions to enhance students' understanding of these interdisciplinary concepts.

Generating Physical Dynamics under Priors,"Zihan Zhou, Xiaoxue Wang, Tianshu Yu","Generating physically feasible dynamics in a data-driven context is challenging, especially when adhering to physical priors expressed in specific equations or formulas. Existing methodologies often overlook the integration of physical priors, resulting in violation of basic physical laws and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates physical priors into diffusion-based generative models to address this limitation. Our approach leverages two categories of priors: 1) distributional priors, such as roto-translational invariance, and 2) physical feasibility priors, including energy and momentum conservation laws and PDE constraints. By embedding these priors into the generative process, our method can efficiently generate physically realistic dynamics, encompassing trajectories and flows. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method produces high-quality dynamics across a diverse array of physical phenomena with remarkable robustness, underscoring its potential to advance data-driven studies in AI4Physics. Our contributions signify a substantial advancement in the field of generative modeling, offering a robust solution to generate accurate and physically consistent dynamics.",2024-09-01T14:43:47Z,2024-09-01T14:43:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00730v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00730v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
The Epistemology of Contemporary Physics: Introduction,Taha Sochi,"This is the first of a series of papers that we intend to publish about the epistemology of fundamental physics in its current state. One of the main objectives of these papers is to improve our understanding of fundamental physics (and modern physics in particular) from an epistemological and interpretative perspective (i.e. versus formal perspective). Another main objective is to investigate and assess the merit of searching for a unified physical theory (the so-called ``theory of everything'') considering the fact that contemporary physics is a collection of theories created and developed by different individuals and groups of scientists in different eras of history reflecting different levels of scientific, philosophical and epistemological development and dealing with largely separate physical phenomena and hence such unification may mean ``stitching together'' an inhomogeneous collection of theoretical structures which may be clumsy (if not impossible) at least from an epistemological viewpoint.",2024-09-27T09:38:20Z,2024-09-27T09:38:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00040v1,"physics.pop-ph, physics.ed-ph, physics.hist-ph"
Role of inclusiveness of learning environment in predicting students'   outcomes in courses in which women are not underrepresented,"Sonja Cwik, Chandralekha Singh","Student beliefs in introductory physics courses can influence their course outcomes and retention in STEM disciplines and future career aspirations. This study used survey data from 501 students in the first of two-semester algebra-based introductory physics courses primarily taken by bioscience majors, in which women make up approximately 65% of the class. We investigated how the learning environment including perceived recognition, peer interaction, and sense of belonging correlate with students' physics outcomes, including their physics self-efficacy, interest, and identity. We found that in general, women had lower physics beliefs than men and the learning environment plays a major role in explaining student outcomes. We also found that perceived recognition played an important role in predicting students' physics identity and students' sense of belonging played an important role in predicting students' physics self-efficacy in the first algebra-based introductory physics course investigated. These findings can be useful to contemplate strategies to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment to help all students to excel in these physics courses.",2024-10-22T22:00:37Z,2024-10-22T22:00:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17451v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17451v1,physics.ed-ph
Physics Reasoner: Knowledge-Augmented Reasoning for Solving Physics   Problems with Large Language Models,"Xinyu Pang, Ruixin Hong, Zhanke Zhou, Fangrui Lv, Xinwei Yang, Zhilong Liang, Bo Han, Changshui Zhang","Physics problems constitute a significant aspect of reasoning, necessitating complicated reasoning ability and abundant physics knowledge. However, existing large language models (LLMs) frequently fail due to a lack of knowledge or incorrect knowledge application. To mitigate these issues, we propose Physics Reasoner, a knowledge-augmented framework to solve physics problems with LLMs. Specifically, the proposed framework constructs a comprehensive formula set to provide explicit physics knowledge and utilizes checklists containing detailed instructions to guide effective knowledge application. Namely, given a physics problem, Physics Reasoner solves it through three stages: problem analysis, formula retrieval, and guided reasoning. During the process, checklists are employed to enhance LLMs' self-improvement in the analysis and reasoning stages. Empirically, Physics Reasoner mitigates the issues of insufficient knowledge and incorrect application, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SciBench with an average accuracy improvement of 5.8%.",2024-12-18T12:33:50Z,2024-12-18T12:33:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13791v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13791v1,cs.CL

Physical AI Agents: Integrating Cognitive Intelligence with Real-World   Action,Fouad Bousetouane,"Vertical AI Agents are revolutionizing industries by delivering domain-specific intelligence and tailored solutions. However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks.   This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context.   Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.",2025-01-15T16:46:32Z,2025-01-15T16:46:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08944v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08944v1,cs.MA
Do generative video models learn physical principles from watching   videos?,"Saman Motamed, Laura Culp, Kevin Swersky, Priyank Jaini, Robert Geirhos","AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn ``world models'' that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

Generative Physical AI in Vision: A Survey,"Daochang Liu, Junyu Zhang, Anh-Dung Dinh, Eunbyung Park, Shichao Zhang, Chang Xu","Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced the field of computer vision by enabling machines to create and interpret visual data with unprecedented sophistication. This transformation builds upon a foundation of generative models to produce realistic images, videos, and 3D or 4D content. Traditionally, generative models primarily focus on visual fidelity while often neglecting the physical plausibility of generated content. This gap limits their effectiveness in applications requiring adherence to real-world physical laws, such as robotics, autonomous systems, and scientific simulations. As generative AI evolves to increasingly integrate physical realism and dynamic simulation, its potential to function as a ""world simulator"" expands-enabling the modeling of interactions governed by physics and bridging the divide between virtual and physical realities. This survey systematically reviews this emerging field of physics-aware generative AI in computer vision, categorizing methods based on how they incorporate physical knowledge-either through explicit simulation or implicit learning.

Multi-Physics Simulations via Coupled Fourier Neural Operator,"Shibo Li, Tao Wang, Yifei Sun, Hewei Tang","Physical simulations are essential tools across critical fields such as mechanical and aerospace engineering, chemistry, meteorology, etc. While neural operators, particularly the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have shown promise in predicting simulation results with impressive performance and efficiency, they face limitations when handling real-world scenarios involving coupled multi-physics outputs. Current neural operator methods either overlook the correlations between multiple physical processes or employ simplistic architectures that inadequately capture these relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel coupled multi-physics neural operator learning (COMPOL) framework that extends the capabilities of Fourier operator layers to model interactions among multiple physical processes. Our approach implements feature aggregation through recurrent and attention mechanisms, enabling comprehensive modeling of coupled interactions. Our method's core is an innovative system for aggregating latent features from multi-physics processes. These aggregated features serve as enriched information sources for neural operator layers, allowing our framework to capture complex physical relationships accurately. We evaluated our coupled multi-physics neural operator across diverse physical simulation tasks, including biological systems, fluid mechanics, and multiphase flow in porous media.

Hadron Physics at J-PARC,S. Kumano,"An outline is explained for hadron-physics projects at J-PARC, which is considered to be one of the flagship facilities in hadron physics from 2008. The facility provides an intensity frontier with 50 GeV proton beam for nuclear and particle physics. It could cover a wide range of hadron physics from strongly interacting many-body systems with an extended hadronic degree of freedom, strangeness, to new forms of hadrons and hadronic matters. These studies lead not only to create innovative fields of hadron physics but also, possibly, to understand fundamental interactions because of recent progress on AdS/CFT correspondence. At the first stage of the J-PARC operation, hadron topics are mainly on strangeness nuclear physics such as hypernuclei, kaonic nuclei, and possible pentaquark hadrons. Then, the studies could be extended to exotic hadron searches, chiral dynamics in nuclear medium, structure functions, hard exclusive processes, hadron physics in neutrino scattering, and spin structure of the nucleon. With major upgrades of the facility, extensive studies could be done for the nucleon spin, heavy-ion physics, and hadron physics at a high-energy neutrino factory.",2006-08-10T04:08:21Z,2006-08-10T04:08:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0608105v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0608105v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex, nucl-ex, nucl-th"
Language is Physical,Paul Benioff,"Some aspects of the physical nature of language are discussed. In particular, physical models of language must exist that are efficiently implementable. The existence requirement is essential because without physical models no communication or thinking would be possible. Efficient implementability for creating and reading language expressions is discussed and illustrated with a quantum mechanical model. The reason for interest in language is that language expressions can have meaning, either as an informal language or as a formal language associated with a mathematical or physical theory. It is noted that any universally applicable physical theory, or coherent theory of physics and mathematics together, includes in its domain physical models of expressons for both the informal language used to discuss the theory and expressions of the theory itself. It follows that there must be formulas in the formal theory that express some of their own physical properties. Inclusion of intelligent system in the theory domain means that the theory, e.g., quantum mechanics, must describe in some sense its own validation. Maps of language expressions into physical states are discussed as are conditions under which such a map is a Godel map. The possibility that language is also mathematical is very briefly discussed.",2002-10-31T18:28:51Z,2002-10-31T18:28:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210211v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0210211v1,"quant-ph, hep-th"
Blogging in the physics classroom: A research-based approach to shaping   students' attitudes towards physics,"Gintaras Duda, Katherine Garrett","Even though there has been a tremendous amount of research done in how to help students learn physics, students are still coming away missing a crucial piece of the puzzle: why bother with physics? Students learn fundamental laws and how to calculate, but come out of a general physics course without a deep understanding of how physics has transformed the world around them. In other words, they get the ""how"" but not the ""why"". Studies have shown that students leave introductory physics courses almost universally with decreased expectations and with a more negative attitude. This paper will detail an experiment to address this problem: a course weblog or ""blog"" which discusses real-world applications of physics and engages students in discussion and thinking outside of class. Specifically, students' attitudes towards the value of physics and its applicability to the real-world were probed using a 26-question Likert scale survey over the course of four semesters in an introductory physics course at a comprehensive Jesuit university. We found that students who did not participate in the blog study generally exhibited a deterioration in attitude towards physics as seen previously. However, students who read, commented, and were involved with the blog maintained their initially positive attitudes towards physics. Student response to the blog was overwhelmingly positive, with students claiming that the blog made the things we studied in the classroom come alive for them and seem much more relevant.",2007-08-13T19:25:05Z,2008-06-25T19:50:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1759v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1759v2,physics.ed-ph
When does a physical system compute?,"Dominic Horsman, Susan Stepney, Rob C. Wagner, Viv Kendon","Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been, however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract computational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology, leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.",2013-09-30T19:37:43Z,2014-06-16T08:40:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7979v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7979v3,"cs.ET, physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"
"What is Physics: The individual and the universal, and seeing past the   noise",A. R. P. Rau,"Along with weaving together observations, experiments, and theoretical constructs into a coherent mesh of understanding of the world around us, physics over its past five centuries has continuously refined the base concepts on which the whole framework is built. In quantum physics, first in non-relativistic mechanics and later in quantum field theories, even familiar concepts of position, momentum, wave or particle, are derived constructs from the classical limit in which we live but not intrinsic to the underlying physics. Most crucially, the very idea of the individual, whether an object or an event, distinguished only in a mere label of identity from others identical to it in all the physics, exists only as an approximation, not an element of underlying reality. Failure to recognize this and seeking alternative explanations in many worlds or multiverses leads only to incoherent logic and incorrect physics.   As an example, in a physical system such as an atom in a particular state, physics deals with the universal system of all such atoms but makes no meaningful prediction of the position of an electron or the time of decay of any specific atom. Those are incidental, entirely random among all possible positions and times, even while physics makes very precise predictions for the distribution of the outcomes in measurements on atoms in that state. Physics deals with the universal, not the individual.",2016-05-09T19:41:32Z,2016-05-09T19:41:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03106v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03106v1,"physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"
Hermione and the Secretary: How gendered task division in introductory   physics labs can disrupt equitable learning,"Danny Doucette, Russell Clark, Chandralekha Singh","Physics labs provide a unique opportunity for students to grow their physics identity and science identity in general since they provide students with opportunity to tinker with experiments and analyze data in a low-stakes environment. However, it is important to ensure that all students are benefiting from the labs equally and have a positive growth trajectory. Through interviews and reflexive ethnographic observations, we identify and analyze two common modes of work that may disadvantage female students in introductory physics labs. Students who adopt the Secretary archetype are relegated to recording and analyzing data, and thus miss out on much of the opportunity to grow their physics and science identities by engaging fully in the experimental work. Meanwhile, students in the Hermione mode shoulder a disproportionate amount of managerial work, and also do not get adequate opportunity to engage with different aspects of the experimental work that are essential for helping them develop their physics and science identities. Using a physics identity framework, we analyze interviews and observational data to investigate how students under these modes of work may experience stunted growth in their physics and science identity trajectories in their physics lab course. This stunted growth then perpetuates and reinforces societal stereotypes and biases about who does physics. This categorization not only gives a vocabulary to discussions about equity in the lab, but can also serve as a useful touchstone for those who seek to center equity in efforts to transform physics instruction.",2019-08-19T14:23:58Z,2020-02-03T15:46:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06827v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06827v2,physics.ed-ph
Physical Reality and the Unobservables of Physical Nature,C. S. Unnikrishnan,"The fundamental physical theories that interpret and explain behaviour of matter in nature are dependent on several unobservables and insensibles in their construction. While a rigorous natural philosophy cannot take them for granted, there does not seem to be a way of avoiding such unobservables in our theories. While a program to banish all unobservables from physical theory is unlikely to succeed, and perhaps even unnecessary, they are both the strong and weak points of the theoretical descriptions of physical nature. Analyzing them for empirical and philosophical consistency and integrity is always a promising path towards a better theory. In this paper, I examine the nature of physical reality in the context of unobservables in physics and discuss three examples. One is about the apparent loss of physical reality due to the need for a consistent quantum mechanical representation. The second example deals with the conflict between the assumed reality of quantum fields, so fundamental and essential to our standard physics worldview, and the dynamics of the observable universe. The third deals with an all-important difference between conventional modern physics constructed in the unreal and unobservable empty `space' and an empirically and logically determined physics with matter-filled universe as its arena. The acknowledgment of the observable matter-filled universe necessitates reformulation of dynamics with total relativity. Not surprisingly, this paradigm with its universal cosmic links also holds human concepts of harmony and beauty.",2020-01-21T10:55:22Z,2020-01-21T10:55:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10009v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10009v1,physics.hist-ph
Case Study: Context Interactions & Physics Faculty's Professional   Development,"Shams El-Adawy, Tra Huynh, Mary Bridget Kustusch, Eleanor C. Sayre","This paper investigates the interactions between context and professional development of physics instructors in a case study of two physics faculty. A phenomenological-case study approach was used to analyze two physics faculty at different institutions over a year and a half using three semi-structured interviews each. The data enabled the identification of relevant context elements; and the impact of these elements on physics faculty was explored by adapting a framework that examines instructors' professional development. The analysis shows that both case study subjects used their physics expertise and growing understanding of their context to develop their physics teaching. However, this growth was enacted differently given the nature of their context, highlighting instructors' strengths in navigating their local context to improve their physics teaching. The results show the subtleties of how context has a salient, complex, and evolving role in moderating faculty's professional development. By taking a faculty-centric approach, this paper broadens the community's awareness of the ways physics instructors develop their physics teaching.

Physically Explainable CNN for SAR Image Classification,"Zhongling Huang, Xiwen Yao, Ying Liu, Corneliu Octavian Dumitru, Mihai Datcu, Junwei Han","Integrating the special electromagnetic characteristics of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in deep neural networks is essential in order to enhance the explainability and physics awareness of deep learning. In this paper, we first propose a novel physically explainable convolutional neural network for SAR image classification, namely physics guided and injected learning (PGIL). It comprises three parts: (1) explainable models (XM) to provide prior physics knowledge, (2) physics guided network (PGN) to encode the knowledge into physics-aware features, and (3) physics injected network (PIN) to adaptively introduce the physics-aware features into classification pipeline for label prediction. A hybrid Image-Physics SAR dataset format is proposed for evaluation, with both Sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 SAR data being experimented.

Physics-informed ConvNet: Learning Physical Field from a Shallow Neural   Network,"Pengpeng Shi, Zhi Zeng, Tianshou Liang","Big-data-based artificial intelligence (AI) supports profound evolution in almost all of science and technology. However, modeling and forecasting multi-physical systems remain a challenge due to unavoidable data scarcity and noise. Improving the generalization ability of neural networks by ""teaching"" domain knowledge and developing a new generation of models combined with the physical laws have become promising areas of machine learning research. Different from ""deep"" fully-connected neural networks embedded with physical information (PINN), a novel shallow framework named physics-informed convolutional network (PICN) is recommended from a CNN perspective, in which the physical field is generated by a deconvolution layer and a single convolution layer. The difference fields forming the physical operator are constructed using the pre-trained shallow convolution layer. An efficient linear interpolation network calculates the loss function involving boundary conditions and the physical constraints in irregular geometry domains. The effectiveness of the current development is illustrated through some numerical cases involving the solving (and estimation) of nonlinear physical operator equations and recovering physical information from noisy observations.

A Survey on Physical Adversarial Attack in Computer Vision,"Donghua Wang, Wen Yao, Tingsong Jiang, Guijian Tang, Xiaoqian Chen","Over the past decade, deep learning has revolutionized conventional tasks that rely on hand-craft feature extraction with its strong feature learning capability, leading to substantial enhancements in traditional tasks. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by malicious tiny noise, which is imperceptible to human observers but can make DNNs output the wrong result. Existing adversarial attacks can be categorized into digital and physical adversarial attacks. The former is designed to pursue strong attack performance in lab environments while hardly remaining effective when applied to the physical world. In contrast, the latter focus on developing physical deployable attacks, thus exhibiting more robustness in complex physical environmental conditions. Recently, with the increasing deployment of the DNN-based system in the real world, strengthening the robustness of these systems is an emergency, while exploring physical adversarial attacks exhaustively is the precondition. To this end, this paper reviews the evolution of physical adversarial attacks against DNN-based computer vision tasks, expecting to provide beneficial information for developing stronger physical adversarial attacks. Specifically, we first proposed a taxonomy to categorize the current physical adversarial attacks and grouped them. Then, we discuss the existing physical attacks and focus on the technique for improving the robustness of physical attacks under complex physical environmental conditions. Finally, we discuss the issues of the current physical adversarial attacks to be solved and give promising directions.",2022-09-28T17:23:52Z,2023-09-18T05:47:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14262v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14262v3,cs.CV
"Progression in self-efficacy, interest, identity, sense of belonging,   perceived recognition and effectiveness of peer interaction of physics majors   and comparison with non-majors and Ph.D. students","Kyle Whitcomb, Alexandru Maries, Chandralekha Singh","The importance of science beliefs such as self-efficacy, interest, identity, sense of belonging, perceived recognition and effectiveness of peer interaction in science education has been increasingly recognized in recent years. Here, we use five years of data from a validated survey administered to non-majors during their first year, physics majors throughout their undergraduate education, and first-year physics Ph.D. students at a large research university in the US. We find that physics majors in the first-year responded to the survey prompts more positively than their non-physics major peers who were in the same introductory courses, with the largest differences in perceived recognition, interest, and physics identity and somewhat smaller differences in self-efficacy, perception of peer interaction, and sense of belonging. Further, the average survey responses of physics majors for each belief remain largely constant over time from their first-year of the undergraduate curriculum through the last year and comparable to the Ph.D. students. This suggests that students are adjusting their interpretation of the survey items to match the current level of expertise expected of them. One exception occurs in the second year, when peer interaction and sense of belonging reach a minimum. Moreover, physics identity dips to the lowest value in the fourth year when many students are contemplating continuing in physics beyond their undergraduate years or switching fields. We also find that perceived recognition is the best predictor of physics identity for physics majors throughout their entire physics education, pointing to the importance of instructors making a concerted effort to recognize and affirm their students throughout their education.",2023-04-12T23:55:10Z,2023-04-12T23:55:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06192v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06192v1,physics.ed-ph
Undergraduate physics students' experiences: Exploring the impact of   underrepresented identities and intersectionality,"Dakota Keblbeck, Katrina Piatek-Jimenez, Cielo Medina Medina","Historically, physics has been a predominantly male field, with previous literature showing there is little diversity amongst U.S. physics students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Recent research indicates that the lack of underrepresented minorities in physics is partially due to an unwelcoming climate within physics departments, as well as differential experiences during college. Most physics education research that addresses the lack of underrepresented identities within the field has focused on the identities of women and people of color. There has been little research to investigate people with multiple underrepresented identities, including those such as socioeconomic status, first-generation college students, or learning disabilities. Furthermore, there has been even less research conducted to better understand the impacts of the intersection of these underrepresented identities and how it relates to experiences when pursuing a physics major. To address this gap in the literature, our research has investigated undergraduate physics students' experiences, to better understand what factors affect their experiences and how these may differ by the intersection of one's underrepresented identities. To achieve this goal, we conducted a series of in-depth interviews with physics majors at one university to learn more about their college experiences regarding physics. Our findings suggest that there is a disproportionate number of obstacles when pursuing a physics major faced by those with a greater number of underrepresented identities. We conclude that there is a need for more equitable pedagogical practices and departmental policies within the undergraduate physics experience, in addition to, a more ""human"" approach to mentorship, in order to foster an environment in which students with underrepresented identities can feel supported and thrive academically and professionally.",2023-06-29T19:44:21Z,2024-02-06T17:08:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17280v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17280v2,physics.ed-ph
Towards a Generalized Assessment of Computational Thinking for   Introductory Physics Students,"Justin Gambrell, Eric Brewe","Computational thinking in physics has many different forms, definitions, and implementations depending on the level of physics, or the institution it is presented in. In order to better integrate computational thinking in introductory physics, we need to understand what physicists find important about computational thinking in introductory physics. We present a qualitative analysis of twenty-six interviews asking academic (N=18) and industrial (N=8) physicists about the teaching and learning of computational thinking in introductory physics courses. These interviews are part of a longer-term project towards developing an assessment protocol for computational thinking in introductory physics. We find that academic and industrial physicists value students' ability to read code and that Python (or VPython) and spreadsheets were the preferred computational language or environment used. Additionally, the interviewees mentioned that identifying the core physics concepts within a program, explaining code to others, and good program hygiene (i.e., commenting and using meaningful variable names) are important skills for introductory students to acquire. We also find that while a handful of interviewees note that the experience and skills gained from computation are quite useful for student's future careers, they also describe multiple limiting factors of teaching computation in introductory physics, such as curricular overhaul, not having ""space"" for computation, and student rejection. The interviews show that while adding computational thinking to physics students repertoire is important, the importance really comes from using computational thinking to learn and understand physics better. This informs us that the assessment we develop should only include the basics of computational thinking needed to assess introductory physics knowledge.",2023-08-07T13:51:05Z,2023-08-07T13:51:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03593v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03593v1,physics.ed-ph
A Physics Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) Framework for Vehicle   Trajectory Prediction,"Keke Long, Zihao Sheng, Haotian Shi, Xiaopeng Li, Sikai Chen, Sue Ahn","In vehicle trajectory prediction, physics models and data-driven models are two predominant methodologies. However, each approach presents its own set of challenges: physics models fall short in predictability, while data-driven models lack interpretability. Addressing these identified shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) model. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods for traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual learning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a predicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability inherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to data-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as its residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics car-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction with a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and PINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training, offering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the data-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable performance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics car-following model.",2023-09-26T21:41:45Z,2024-03-21T04:36:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15284v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15284v2,cs.LG
A Hybrid Simulation of DNN-based Gray Box Models,"Aayushya Agarwal, Yihan Ruan, Larry Pileggi","Simulation is vital for engineering disciplines, as it enables the prediction and design of physical systems. However, the computational challenges inherent to large-scale simulations often arise from complex device models featuring high degrees of nonlinearities or hidden physical behaviors not captured by first principles. Gray-box models combine deep neural networks (DNNs) with physics-based models to address the computational challenges in modeling physical systems. A well-crafted gray box model capitalizes on the interpretability and accuracy of a physical model while incorporating DNNs to capture hidden physical behaviors and mitigate computational load associated with highly nonlinear components. Previously, gray box models have been constructed by defining an explicit combination of physics-based and DNN models to represent the behavior of sub-systems; however this cannot represent the coupled interactions within physical systems. We explore an implicit gray box model, where both DNNs and physical equations share a common set of state-variables. While this approach captures coupled interactions at the boundary of DNN and physics-based models, simulating the implicit gray box model remains an open-ended problem. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid simulation that integrates DNNs into the numerical solvers of simulation engines to fully simulate implicit gray box models of large physical systems. This is accomplished by backpropagating through the DNN to calculate Jacobian values during each iteration of the numerical method. The hybrid simulation improves the accuracy and runtime compared to physics-based simulation and enables reusable DNN models with lower data requirements. We explore the advantages of this approach as compared to physics-based, black box, and other gray box methods for simulating the steady-state and transient behavior of power systems.",2024-10-22T15:28:51Z,2024-10-22T15:28:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17103v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Physics Encoded Blocks in Residual Neural Network Architectures for   Digital Twin Models,"Muhammad Saad Zia, Ashiq Anjum, Lu Liu, Anthony Conway, Anasol Pena Rios","Physics Informed Machine Learning has emerged as a popular approach in modelling and simulation for digital twins to generate accurate models of processes and behaviours of real-world systems. However, despite their success in generating accurate and reliable models, the existing methods either use simple regularizations in loss functions to offer limited physics integration or are too specific in architectural definitions to be generalized to a wide variety of physical systems. This paper presents a generic approach based on a novel physics-encoded residual neural network architecture to combine data-driven and physics-based analytical models to address these limitations. Our method combines physics blocks as mathematical operators from physics-based models with learning blocks comprising feed-forward layers. Intermediate residual blocks are incorporated for stable gradient flow as they train on physical system observation data. This way, the model learns to comply with the geometric and kinematic aspects of the physical system. Compared to conventional neural network-based methods, our method improves generalizability with substantially low data requirements and model complexity in terms of parameters, especially in scenarios where prior physics knowledge is either elementary or incomplete. We investigate our approach in two application domains. The first is a basic robotic motion model using Euler Lagrangian equations of motion as physics prior. The second application is a complex scenario of a steering model for a self-driving vehicle in a simulation. In both applications, our method outperforms both conventional neural network based approaches as-well as state-of-the-art Physics Informed Machine Learning methods.",2024-11-18T11:58:20Z,2024-11-18T11:58:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11497v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11497v1,"cs.LG, cs.RO"

However, this area remains under-explored due to the inherent ambiguities in physical property estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianProperty, a training-free framework that assigns physical properties of materials to 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we integrate the segmentation capability of SAM with the recognition capability of GPT-4V(ision) to formulate a global-local physical property reasoning module for 2D images. Then we project the physical properties from multi-view 2D images to 3D Gaussians using a voting strategy. We demonstrate that 3D Gaussians with physical property annotations enable applications in physics-based dynamic simulation and robotic grasping. For physics-based dynamic simulation, we leverage the Material Point Method (MPM) for realistic dynamic simulation. For robot grasping, we develop a grasping force prediction strategy that estimates a safe force range required for object grasping based on the estimated physical properties. Extensive experiments on material segmentation, physics-based dynamic simulation, and robotic grasping validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, highlighting its crucial role in understanding physical properties from visual data.

The Notion of Time in Special Relativity,"Yefim Bakman, Boris Pogorelsky","Even though the concepts of time and space are basic concepts of physics, they have not been vouchsafed a constructive definition. As to space, this is no wonder because a correct notion of space cannot be formed in the frame of the existing physical paradigm. However, a definition of time can be given on the basis of the simple principle that each physical magnitude constitutes a feature of some physical carrier (Costa, 1987). This article deals with identifying that carrier for the feature ""time"". Finally this article affirms that because of the lack of a definition of time some physical experiments have been erroneously interpreted as signs of time dilation.",2007-01-09T17:21:58Z,2007-05-19T07:50:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0701109v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0701109v2,physics.gen-ph

Monopole and Topological Electron Dynamics in Adiabatic Spintronic and   Graphene Systems,"S. G. Tan, M. B. A. Jalil, Takashi Fujita","A unified theoretical treatment is presented to describe the physics of electron dynamics in semiconductor and graphene systems. Electron spin fast alignment with the Zeeman magnetic field (physical or effective) is treated as a form of adiabatic spin evolution which necessarily generates a monopole in magnetic space. One could transform this monopole into the physical and intuitive topological magnetic fields in the useful momentum (K) or real spaces (R). The physics of electron dynamics related to spin Hall, torque, oscillations and other technologically useful spinor effects can be inferred from the topological magnetic fields in spintronic, graphene and other SU(2) systems.",2009-01-22T06:15:36Z,2009-01-22T06:15:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3411v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.3411v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall"
Physical Properties of Biological Membranes,Thomas Heimburg,"Biological membranes mainly consist of lipids and proteins. While the proteins have many functions as single molecules, the membrane as a whole displays physical properties that cannot be explained on the single molecule level. For example, membranes show melting events, phase behavior, and elasticity. Biomembranes adapt their composition such that the physical properties are maintained when the external conditions change. This gives a role to changes in composition, to temperature and pressure. This article introduces into the physics of membranes as a whole and shows how phenomena as permeability, pulse propagation and the effect of anesthetics arise.",2009-02-16T20:43:47Z,2009-02-16T21:36:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2454v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.2454v2,physics.bio-ph

Top-quark Pair Production in a Running Mass Scheme,"Matthew Dowling, Sven Moch","Between the Tevatron and LHC, top-quark physics is now becoming an area for precision physics.

This point has so far been made with respect to Bohms quantum theory. Against this background, this paper seeks to achieve the following four results: to generalize the option of quantum Humeanism from Bohmian mechanics to primitive ontology theories in general, to show that this option applies also to classical mechanics, to establish that it requires a commitment to matter as primitive stuff, but no commitment to natural properties (physicalism without properties, to point out that by removing the commitment to properties, the stock metaphysical objections against Humeanism from quidditism and humility no longer apply.

In so doing, we uncover two pervasive forms of category-theoretic generalization. We call these `generalization by duality' and `generalization by categorifying physical processes'. We describe in detail how these arise, and explain their significance using detailed examples. We show that their significance is two-fold: the articulation of high-level physical concepts, and the generation of new models.",2014-04-11T09:33:30Z,2014-04-11T09:33:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3049v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3049v1,"physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"

Modern physics has shown that fields are fundamental entities, and in particular that the electromagnetic field is fundamental. Here I hypothesize that consciousness arises from information intrinsic to fundamental fields. This hypothesis unites fundamental physics with what we know empirically about the neuroscience underlying consciousness, and it bypasses the need to consider quantum effects.",2014-07-03T13:33:45Z,2014-07-03T13:33:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4706v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4706v1,q-bio.OT

Rudolf Haag's legacy of Local Quantum Physics and reminiscences about a   cherished teacher and friend,Bert Schroer,"After some personal recollectioms about Rudolf Haag and his thoughts which led him to ""Local Quantum Physics"", the present work recalls his ideas about scattering theory, the relation between local observables and localized fields and his contributions to the physical aspects of modular operator theory which paved the way for an intrisic understanding of quantum causal localization in which fields ""coordinatize"" the local algebras. The paper ends with the presentation of string-local fields whose construction and use in a new renormalization theory for higher spin fields is part of an ongoing reformulation of gauge theory in the conceptual setting of Haag's LQP.",2016-11-30T15:22:25Z,2016-11-30T15:22:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00003v1,"math-ph, math.MP, physics.hist-ph"

The demographics of physics education research,"Stephen Kanim, Ximena C. Cid","Is physics education research based on a representative sample of students? To answer this question we skimmed physics education research papers from three journals for the years 1970 - 2015 looking for the number of research subjects, the course the subjects were enrolled in, and the institution where the research was conducted. We then compared the demographics of our research population to those of all students taking physics in the United States. Our results suggest that research subjects as a whole are better prepared mathematically and are less diverse than the overall physics student population.",2017-10-06T22:01:36Z,2017-10-06T22:01:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02598v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02598v1,physics.ed-ph

Recent progress in applying lattice QCD to kaon physics,Xu Feng,Standard lattice calculations in kaon physics are based on the evaluation of matrix elements of local operators between two single-hadron states or a single-hadron state and the vacuum. Recent progress in lattice QCD has gone beyond these standard observables.

From Quantum Foundations to Applications and Back,"Nicolas Gisin, Florian Fröwis","Quantum non-locality has been an extremely fruitful subject of research, leading the scientific revolution towards quantum information science, in particular to device-independent quantum information processing. We argue that time is ripe to work on another basic problem in the foundations of quantum physics, the quantum measurement problem, that should produce good physics both in theoretical, mathematical, experimental and applied physics.

A physical realization of our theory necessitates the use of a synthetic dimension, recently promoted and realized in condensed matter physics. In the simplest incarnation of the theory, we find a Skyrmion and a sphaleron - the latter being an unstable soliton.

Derive the supersymmetric Lagrangian - the superpotential W. Soft supersymmetry breaking - underlying physics - the general soft-breaking Lagrangian - the MSSM. The \mu opportunity - R-parity conservation. Count of parameters - constraints - measuring the parameters. Connecting the weak and unification scale. Derivation of the Higgs mechanism - in what sense does supersymmetry explain the Higgs physics.   The Higgs spectrum - \tan\beta, Yukawa couplings, constraints. LEP Higgs physics - Tevatron Higgs physics can confirm the Higgs mechanism and coupling proportional to mass - measurements in the Higgs sector. gluino, Neutralino, Chargino - cannot in general measure \tan\beta at hadron colliders. Effects of soft phases - all observables, not only CPV ones, g-2, EDMs, gluino phase, LSP CDM, possible connections to stringy physics. Phase structure of simple D-brane models.

Students' views about the nature of experimental physics,"Bethany R. Wilcox, H. J. Lewandowski","The physics community explores and explains the physical world through a blend of theoretical and experimental studies. The future of physics as a discipline depends on training of students in both the theoretical and experimental aspects of the field. However, while student learning within lecture courses has been the subject of extensive research, lab courses remain relatively under-studied. In particular, there is little, if any, data available that addresses the effectiveness of physics lab courses at encouraging students to recognize the nature and importance of experimental physics within the discipline as a whole. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale, national study ($N_{institutions}=75$ and $N_{students}=7167$) of undergraduate physics lab courses through analysis of students' responses to a research-validated assessment designed to investigate students' beliefs about the nature of experimental physics. We find that students often enter and leave physics lab courses with ideas about experimental physics as practiced in their courses that are inconsistent with the views of practicing experimental physicists, and this trend holds at both the introductory and upper-division levels. Despite this inconsistency, we find that both introductory and upper-division students are able to accurately predict the expert-like response even in cases where their views about experimentation in their lab courses disagree. These finding have implications for the recruitment, retention, and adequate preparation of students in physics.",2017-08-14T17:43:51Z,2017-08-14T17:43:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04226v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04226v1,physics.ed-ph

A Learning Based Approach for Uncertainty Analysis in Numerical Weather   Prediction Models,"Azam Moosavi, Vishwas Rao, Adrian Sandu","Complex numerical weather prediction models incorporate a variety of physical processes, each described by multiple alternative physical schemes with specific parameters. The selection of the physical schemes and the choice of the corresponding physical parameters during model configuration can significantly impact the accuracy of model forecasts. There is no combination of physical schemes that works best for all times, at all locations, and under all conditions. It is therefore of considerable interest to understand the interplay between the choice of physics and the accuracy of the resulting forecasts under different conditions. This paper demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to study the uncertainty in numerical weather prediction models due to the interaction of multiple physical processes. The first problem addressed herein is the estimation of systematic model errors in output quantities of interest at future times, and the use of this information to improve the model forecasts. The second problem considered is the identification of those specific physical processes that contribute most to the forecast uncertainty in the quantity of interest under specified meteorological conditions.   The discrepancies between model results and observations at past times are used to learn the relationships between the choice of physical processes and the resulting forecast errors. Numerical experiments are carried out with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.

Physics without Determinism: Alternative Interpretations of Classical   Physics,"Flavio Del Santo, Nicolas Gisin","Classical physics is generally regarded as deterministic, as opposed to quantum mechanics that is considered the first theory to have introduced genuine indeterminism into physics. We challenge this view by arguing that the alleged determinism of classical physics relies on the tacit, metaphysical assumption that there exists an actual value of every physical quantity, with its infinite predetermined digits (which we name \emph{principle of infinite precision}). Building on recent information-theoretic arguments showing that the principle of infinite precision (which translates into the attribution of a physical meaning to mathematical real numbers) leads to unphysical consequences, we consider possible alternative indeterministic interpretations of classical physics. We also link those to well-known interpretations of quantum mechanics. In particular, we propose a model of classical indeterminism based on \emph{finite information quantities} (FIQs). Moreover, we discuss the perspectives that an indeterministic physics could open (such as strong emergence), as well as some potential problematic issues. Finally, we make evident that any indeterministic interpretation of physics would have to deal with the problem of explaining how the indeterminate values become determinate, a problem known in the context of quantum mechanics as (part of) the ``quantum measurement problem''. We discuss some similarities between the classical and the quantum measurement problems, and propose ideas for possible solutions (e.g., ``collapse models'' and ``top-down causation'').",2019-09-09T08:34:56Z,2019-11-26T18:28:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03697v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03697v2,"quant-ph, physics.hist-ph"

The Plausibility Paradox for Resized Users in Virtual Environments,"Matti Pouke, Katherine J. Mimnaugh, Alexis Chambers, Timo Ojala, Steven M. LaValle","This paper identifies and confirms a perceptual phenomenon: when users interact with simulated objects in a virtual environment where the users' scale deviates greatly from normal, there is a mismatch between the object physics they consider realistic and the object physics that would be correct at that scale. We report the findings of two studies investigating the relationship between perceived realism and a physically accurate approximation of reality in a virtual reality experience in which the user has been scaled by a factor of ten. Study 1 investigated perception of physics when scaled-down by a factor of ten, whereas Study 2 focused on enlargement by a similar amount. Studies were carried out as within-subjects experiments in which a total of 84 subjects performed simple interaction tasks with objects under two different physics simulation conditions. In the true physics condition, the objects, when dropped and thrown, behaved accurately according to the physics that would be correct at that either reduced or enlarged scale in the real world. In the movie physics condition, the objects behaved in a similar manner as they would if no scaling of the user had occurred. We found that a significant majority of the users considered the movie physics condition to be the more realistic one. However, at enlarged scale, many users considered true physics to match their expectations even if they ultimately believed movie physics to be the realistic condition. We argue that our findings have implications for many virtual reality and telepresence applications involving operation with simulated or physical objects in abnormal and especially small scales.",2021-02-05T13:55:31Z,2021-02-05T13:55:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03179v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03179v1,"cs.HC, cs.MM"

Physics-Guided Machine Learning for Scientific Discovery: An Application   in Simulating Lake Temperature Profiles,"Xiaowei Jia, Jared Willard, Anuj Karpatne, Jordan S Read, Jacob A Zwart, Michael Steinbach, Vipin Kumar","Physics-based models of dynamical systems are often used to study engineering and environmental systems. Despite their extensive use, these models have several well-known limitations due to simplified representations of the physical processes being modeled or challenges in selecting appropriate parameters. While-state-of-the-art machine learning models can sometimes outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can produce results that are physically inconsistent. This paper proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improves the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models, while generating outputs consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where physics-based (also known as mechanistic) models are used, e.g., climate science, materials science, computational chemistry, and biomedicine.",2020-01-28T15:44:45Z,2020-09-14T14:47:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11086v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11086v3,"cs.LG, eess.SP"
Non-Hermitian Physics,"Yuto Ashida, Zongping Gong, Masahito Ueda","A review is given on the foundations and applications of non-Hermitian classical and quantum physics. First, key theorems and central concepts in non-Hermitian linear algebra, including Jordan normal form, biorthogonality, exceptional points, pseudo-Hermiticity and parity-time symmetry, are delineated in a pedagogical and mathematically coherent manner. Building on these, we provide an overview of how diverse classical systems, ranging from photonics, mechanics, electrical circuits, acoustics to active matter, can be used to simulate non-Hermitian wave physics. In particular, we discuss rich and unique phenomena found therein, such as unidirectional invisibility, enhanced sensitivity, topological energy transfer, coherent perfect absorption, single-mode lasing, and robust biological transport. We then explain in detail how non-Hermitian operators emerge as an effective description of open quantum systems on the basis of the Feshbach projection approach and the quantum trajectory approach. We discuss their applications to physical systems relevant to a variety of fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics, mesoscopic physics, and nuclear physics with emphasis on prominent phenomena/subjects in quantum regimes, such as quantum resonances, superradiance, continuous quantum Zeno effect, quantum critical phenomena, Dirac spectra in quantum chromodynamics, and nonunitary conformal field theories. Finally, we introduce the notion of band topology in complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems and present their classifications by providing the proof, firstly given by this review in a complete manner, as well as a number of instructive examples. Other topics related to non-Hermitian physics, including nonreciprocal transport, speed limits, nonunitary quantum walk, are also reviewed.",2020-06-02T18:00:01Z,2020-06-02T18:00:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01837v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01837v1,"cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph"

Hi-Phy: A Benchmark for Hierarchical Physical Reasoning,"Cheng Xue, Vimukthini Pinto, Chathura Gamage, Peng Zhang, Jochen Renz","Reasoning about the behaviour of physical objects is a key capability of agents operating in physical worlds. Humans are very experienced in physical reasoning while it remains a major challenge for AI. To facilitate research addressing this problem, several benchmarks have been proposed recently. However, these benchmarks do not enable us to measure an agent's granular physical reasoning capabilities when solving a complex reasoning task. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark for physical reasoning that allows us to test individual physical reasoning capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire these capabilities, we propose a general hierarchy of physical reasoning capabilities with increasing complexity. Our benchmark tests capabilities according to this hierarchy through generated physical reasoning tasks in the video game Angry Birds. This benchmark enables us to conduct a comprehensive agent evaluation by measuring the agent's granular physical reasoning capabilities. We conduct an evaluation with human players, learning agents, and heuristic agents and determine their capabilities. Our evaluation shows that learning agents, with good local generalization ability, still struggle to learn the underlying physical reasoning capabilities and perform worse than current state-of-the-art heuristic agents and humans. We believe that this benchmark will encourage researchers to develop intelligent agents with advanced, human-like physical reasoning capabilities.

Let's Talk Through Physics! Covert Cyber-Physical Data Exfiltration on   Air-Gapped Edge Devices,"Matthew Chan, Nathaniel Snyder, Marcus Lucas, Luis Garcia, Oleg Sokolsky, James Weimer, Insup Lee, Paulo Tabuada, Saman Zonouz, Mani Srivastava","Although organizations are continuously making concerted efforts to harden their systems against network attacks by air-gapping critical systems, attackers continuously adapt and uncover covert channels to exfiltrate data from air-gapped systems. For instance, attackers have demonstrated the feasibility of exfiltrating data from a computer sitting in a Faraday cage by exfiltrating data using magnetic fields. Although a large body of work has recently emerged highlighting various physical covert channels, these attacks have mostly targeted open-loop cyber-physical systems where the covert channels exist on physical channels that are not being monitored by the victim. Network architectures such as fog computing push sensitive data to cyber-physical edge devices--whose physical side channels are typically monitored via state estimation. In this paper, we formalize covert data exfiltration that uses existing cyber-physical models and infrastructure of individual devices to exfiltrate data in a stealthy manner, i.e., we propose a method to circumvent cyber-physical state estimation intrusion detection techniques while exfiltrating sensitive data from the network. We propose a generalized model for encoding and decoding sensitive data within cyber-physical control loops. We evaluate our approach on a distributed IoT network that includes computation nodes residing on physical drones as well as on an industrial control system for the control of a robotic arm.

Exploring QCD matter in extreme conditions with Machine Learning,"Kai Zhou, Lingxiao Wang, Long-Gang Pang, Shuzhe Shi","In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful computational tool and novel problem-solving perspective for physics, offering new avenues for studying strongly interacting QCD matter properties under extreme conditions. This review article aims to provide an overview of the current state of this intersection of fields, focusing on the application of machine learning to theoretical studies in high energy nuclear physics. It covers diverse aspects, including heavy ion collisions, lattice field theory, and neutron stars, and discuss how machine learning can be used to explore and facilitate the physics goals of understanding QCD matter. The review also provides a commonality overview from a methodology perspective, from data-driven perspective to physics-driven perspective. We conclude by discussing the challenges and future prospects of machine learning applications in high energy nuclear physics, also underscoring the importance of incorporating physics priors into the purely data-driven learning toolbox.

Physics-Driven Diffusion Models for Impact Sound Synthesis from Videos,"Kun Su, Kaizhi Qian, Eli Shlizerman, Antonio Torralba, Chuang Gan","Modeling sounds emitted from physical object interactions is critical for immersive perceptual experiences in real and virtual worlds. Traditional methods of impact sound synthesis use physics simulation to obtain a set of physics parameters that could represent and synthesize the sound. However, they require fine details of both the object geometries and impact locations, which are rarely available in the real world and can not be applied to synthesize impact sounds from common videos. On the other hand, existing video-driven deep learning-based approaches could only capture the weak correspondence between visual content and impact sounds since they lack of physics knowledge. In this work, we propose a physics-driven diffusion model that can synthesize high-fidelity impact sound for a silent video clip. In addition to the video content, we propose to use additional physics priors to guide the impact sound synthesis procedure. The physics priors include both physics parameters that are directly estimated from noisy real-world impact sound examples without sophisticated setup and learned residual parameters that interpret the sound environment via neural networks. We further implement a novel diffusion model with specific training and inference strategies to combine physics priors and visual information for impact sound synthesis. Experimental results show that our model outperforms several existing systems in generating realistic impact sounds. More importantly, the physics-based representations are fully interpretable and transparent, thus enabling us to perform sound editing flexibly.",2023-03-29T17:59:53Z,2023-07-08T07:12:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16897v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16897v3,"cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SD, eess.AS"

PADetBench: Towards Benchmarking Physical Attacks against Object   Detection,"Jiawei Lian, Jianhong Pan, Lefan Wang, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau, Shaohui Mei","Physical attacks against object detection have gained increasing attention due to their significant practical implications. However, conducting physical experiments is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, physical dynamics and cross-domain transformation are challenging to strictly regulate in the real world, leading to unaligned evaluation and comparison, severely hindering the development of physically robust models. To accommodate these challenges, we explore utilizing realistic simulation to thoroughly and rigorously benchmark physical attacks with fairness under controlled physical dynamics and cross-domain transformation. This resolves the problem of capturing identical adversarial images that cannot be achieved in the real world. Our benchmark includes 20 physical attack methods, 48 object detectors, comprehensive physical dynamics, and evaluation metrics. We also provide end-to-end pipelines for dataset generation, detection, evaluation, and further analysis. In addition, we perform 8064 groups of evaluation based on our benchmark, which includes both overall evaluation and further detailed ablation studies for controlled physical dynamics. Through these experiments, we provide in-depth analyses of physical attack performance and physical adversarial robustness, draw valuable observations, and discuss potential directions for future research.

Identifying Terrain Physical Parameters from Vision -- Towards   Physical-Parameter-Aware Locomotion and Navigation,"Jiaqi Chen, Jonas Frey, Ruyi Zhou, Takahiro Miki, Georg Martius, Marco Hutter","Identifying the physical properties of the surrounding environment is essential for robotic locomotion and navigation to deal with non-geometric hazards, such as slippery and deformable terrains. It would be of great benefit for robots to anticipate these extreme physical properties before contact; however, estimating environmental physical parameters from vision is still an open challenge. Animals can achieve this by using their prior experience and knowledge of what they have seen and how it felt. In this work, we propose a cross-modal self-supervised learning framework for vision-based environmental physical parameter estimation, which paves the way for future physical-property-aware locomotion and navigation. We bridge the gap between existing policies trained in simulation and identification of physical terrain parameters from vision. We propose to train a physical decoder in simulation to predict friction and stiffness from multi-modal input. The trained network allows the labeling of real-world images with physical parameters in a self-supervised manner to further train a visual network during deployment, which can densely predict the friction and stiffness from image data. We validate our physical decoder in simulation and the real world using a quadruped ANYmal robot, outperforming an existing baseline method. We show that our visual network can predict the physical properties in indoor and outdoor experiments while allowing fast adaptation to new environments.",2024-08-29T14:35:14Z,2024-08-29T14:35:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16567v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16567v1,"cs.RO, cs.LG"

Generating videos following the fundamental physical laws is still an opening challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to teach video diffusion models with latent physical phenomenon knowledge, enabling the accurate generation of physically informed phenomena. Specifically, we first pretrain Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to reconstruct the physical phenomena, resulting in output embeddings that encapsulate latent physical phenomenon knowledge. Leveraging these embeddings, we could generate the pseudo-language prompt features based on the aligned spatial relationships between CLIP vision and language encoders. Particularly, given that diffusion models typically use CLIP's language encoder for text prompt embeddings, our approach integrates the CLIP visual features informed by latent physical knowledge into a quaternion hidden space. This enables the modeling of spatial relationships to produce physical knowledge-informed pseudo-language prompts. By incorporating these prompt features and fine-tuning the video diffusion model in a parameter-efficient manner, the physical knowledge-informed videos are successfully generated. We validate our method extensively through both numerical simulations and real-world observations of physical phenomena, demonstrating its remarkable performance across diverse scenarios.",2024-11-18T07:26:09Z,2024-11-18T07:26:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11343v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11343v1,"cs.CV, stat.AP"

Physics of mirror photons,"R. Foot, A. Yu. Ignatiev, R. R. Volkas","The physics of kinetic mixing between ordinary and mirror photons is discussed. An important role is played by four linear combinations we dub the physical photon, the sterile photon, the physical mirror photon, and the sterile mirror photon. Because of the mass degeneracy between the two gauge bosons, quantum coherence effects are important. The physical photon becomes a certain coherent superposition of the bare ordinary photon and the bare mirror photon. Similarly, the physical mirror photon is another, but {\it not orthogonal}, coherent superposition. We discuss the physics of the interaction between physical mirror photons and ordinary matter. Observational signatures for some hybrid ordinary/mirror binary astrophysical systems are qualitatively discussed. We show that a small amount of ordinary matter at the center of a mirror star may make the mirror star observable.

Pedagogical Reflections on Color Confinement in Chromostatics,Richard S. Wittman,Abelian and nonabelian gauge invariant states are directly compared to revisit how the unconfined abelian theory is expressed.

Anomaly in conformal quantum mechanics: From molecular physics to black   holes,"Horacio E. Camblong, Carlos R. Ordonez","A number of physical systems exhibit a particular form of asymptotic conformal invariance: within a particular range of distances, they are characterized by a long-range conformal interaction (inverse square potential), the absence of dimensional scales, and an SO(2,1) symmetry algebra. Examples from molecular physics to black holes are provided and discussed within a unified treatment. When such systems are physically realized in the appropriate strong-coupling regime,the occurrence of quantum symmetry breaking is possible. This anomaly is revealed by the failure of the symmetry generators to close the algebra in a manner shown to be independent of the renormalization procedure.",2003-03-19T15:52:23Z,2003-11-17T13:03:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0303166v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0303166v2,"hep-th, gr-qc, hep-ph, math-ph, math.MP, nucl-th, quant-ph"

Since two-by-two matrices with unit determinant form the group SL(2,c) which acts as the universal covering group of the Lorentz group, the two-by-two matrices constitute the natural language for special relativity. The central language for optical instruments is the two-by-two matrix called the beam transfer matrix, or the so-called ABCD matrix. It is shown that the ABCD matrices also form the SL(2,C) group. Thus, it is possible to perform experiments in special relativity using optical instruments.

Conservation laws. Their role in evolutionary processes (The method of   skew-symmetric differential forms),L. I. Petrova,"In the work it has been shown that there are two types of the conservation laws.   1. The conservation laws that can be called exact ones. They point to an avalability of some conservative quantities or objects. Such objects are the physical structures, which the physical fields and relevant manifolds are constructed of. These are conservation laws for physical fields.   2. The conservation laws of energy, linear and angular momentum, and mass. These laws are conservation laws for material systems (material media). They establish a balance between changes of physical quantities and external actions. Such conservation laws can be called as balance ones. It has been shown that the exact and balance conservation laws execute a relation between the physical structures, which form physical fields, and material systems. The physical structures, to which the exact conservation laws correspond, are generated by material systems in the evolutionary processes, whose moving force is the noncommutativity of the balance conservation laws.

Specific features of differential equations of mathematical physics,L. I. Petrova,"Three types of equations of mathematical physics, namely, the equations, which describe any physical processes, the equations of mechanics and physics of continuous media, and field-theory equations are studied in this paper.   In the first and second case the investigation is reduced to the analysis of the nonidentical relations of the skew-symmetric differential forms that are obtained from differential equations. It is shown that the integrability of equations and the properties of their solutions depend on the realization of the conditions of degenerate transformations under which the identical relations are obtained from the nonidentical relation.   The field-theory equations, in contrast to the equations of first two types, are the relations made up by skew-symmetric differential forms or their analogs (differential or integral ones). This is due to the fact that the field-theory equations have to describe physical structures (to which closed exterior forms correspond) rather than physical quantities. The equations that correspond to field theories are obtained from the equations that describe the conservation laws (of energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and mass) of material systems (of continuous media). This disclose a connection between field theories and the equations for material systems (and points to that material media generate physical fields).",2007-02-06T17:30:23Z,2007-02-06T17:30:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0702019v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0702019v1,"math-ph, math.DG, math.MP, LaTex 2e"

New approach for building of unified theory about the Universe and some   results,S. Sarg,"The physical models of a successful unified theory about the Universe must operate in different phase of matter evolution and different fields of physics. The attempts to build such wide range theory as a bunch of theories developed for different fields of physics are not quite successful. The accumulated knowledge from experiments and observations leads to a conclusion that some of the adopted postulates in the modern physics are not absolutely fundamental, as considered so far. A new approach for building of unified model of the Universe suggests resurrection of the principles of causality and logical understanding for any kind of physical phenomena. It is successfully applied in a new theory titled Basic Structures of Matter, which provides fundamentals for a unified theory about the Universe. The new approach leads to different physical models for the elementary particles and the atoms and also to a different concept about the Universe. In the same time the suggested models exhibit the same interaction energies as obtained by the Quantum mechanics and experiments. The analysis of the physical phenomena from a new point of view allows deeper understanding of the relations between the basic physical attributes: mass, energy, space, time, gravitation and inertia.",2002-05-17T19:55:08Z,2002-05-17T19:55:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0205052v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0205052v1,physics.gen-ph

Causality and time-space evolution of physical systems,Enrique Ordaz Romay,"All physical process are subject to some laws which determine with math accurately its time-space evolution. These laws are described, in the last analysis for the principle of causality. The physical space can be homogeneous or heterogeneous in function of the distribution of the physical magnitudes. Applying the principle of causality to the homogeneous space we observe that its more important qualities are: their metric does not depend of the 4coordeninate where it is measured and the light speed constancy [1]. However, to apply the principle of causality in the heterogeneous space is very much fruitful. Thanks to the presence of physical magnitudes that vary in the 4space we can find the equations that this magnitudes should verify so that it takes place their space and time evolution.   Working on the principle of causality like axiom for describe our physical systems, we will obtain the most basic expression of evolution of the magnitudes of the physical system. This expression coincides with the principle of action expressed for a tensorial action [2]. The scalar form of this principle coincides, in its turn, with the traditional relativistic and quantum expression, of the principle of action or principle of least action according to other authors.",2003-02-25T18:33:34Z,2003-02-25T18:33:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0302091v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0302091v1,"physics.gen-ph, physics.ed-ph"

The clouds of physics and Einstein's last query: Can quantum mechanics   be derived from general relativity?,Friedwardt Winterberg,"Towards the end of the 19th century, Kelvin pronounced as the ""clouds of physics"" 1) the failure of the Michelson-Morely experiment to detect an ether wind, 2) the violation of the classical mechanical equipartition theorem in statistical thermodynamics. And he believed that the removal of these clouds would bring physics to an end. But as we know, the removal of these clouds led to the two great breakthoughts of modern physics: 1) The theory of relativity, and 2) to quantum mechanics. Towards the end of the 20th century more clouds of physics became apparent. They are 1) the riddle of quantum gravity, 2) the superluminal quantum correlations, 3) the small cosmological constant. Furthermore, there is the riddle of dark energy making up 70% of the physical universe, the non-baryonic cold dark matter making up 26% and the very small initial entropy of the universe. An attempt is made to explain the importance of these clouds for the future of physics. Conjectures for a possible solution are presented. they have to do with Einstein's last query: ""Can quantum mechanics be derived general relativity"", and with the question is there an ether?",2008-05-20T23:06:55Z,2008-05-20T23:06:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3184v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3184v1,"physics.gen-ph, physics.hist-ph"

A model-independent approach (Vista) considers gross features of the data, and is sensitive to new large cross-section physics. Further sensitivity to new physics is provided by two additional algorithms: a Bump Hunter searches invariant mass distributions for ""bumps"" that could indicate resonant production of new particles; and the Sleuth procedure scans for data excesses at large summed transverse momentum.

Bogoliubov's Vision: Quasiaverages and Broken Symmetry to Quantum   Protectorate and Emergence,A. L.

The profound and innovative idea of quasiaverages formulated by N.N.

We discuss the complementary unifying ideas of modern physics, namely: spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum protectorate and emergence. The interrelation of the concepts of symmetry breaking, quasiaverages and quantum protectorate was analyzed in the context of quantum theory and statistical physics. The chief purposes of this paper were to demonstrate the connection and interrelation of these conceptual advances of the many-body physics and to try to show explicitly that those concepts, though different in details, have a certain common features.

Theory overview of charm physics,S. Fajfer,"Recent developments in charm physics within the standard model and beyond are reviewed. The precision study of leptonic charm meson decays accompanied with the constraints coming from K, B and tau physics enables to determine constraints on models of new physics. The standard model contributions in the D0 - D0bar system are still under investigation including operators of higher dimensions. New physics models such as the Littlest Higgs model or warped extra-dimensional models might modify the amount of CP violation, although CP violating asymmetries are still predicted to be at most of the order 1%. The forward-backward asymmetry in the top anti-top pair production at the Tevatron is opening a new window in the study of new physics in the charm sector. A few of the models considered to explain the observed asymmetry might modify flavor changing neutral current mediated charm processes. New physics searches in rare charm decays are discussed.

Attack Detection and Identification in Cyber-Physical Systems -- Part I:   Models and Fundamental Limitations,"Fabio Pasqualetti, Florian Dörfler, Francesco Bullo","Cyber-physical systems integrate computation, communication, and physical capabilities to interact with the physical world and humans. Besides failures of components, cyber-physical systems are prone to malignant attacks, and specific analysis tools as well as monitoring mechanisms need to be developed to enforce system security and reliability. This paper proposes a unified framework to analyze the resilience of cyber-physical systems against attacks cast by an omniscient adversary. We model cyber-physical systems as linear descriptor systems, and attacks as exogenous unknown inputs. Despite its simplicity, our model captures various real-world cyber-physical systems, and it includes and generalizes many prototypical attacks, including stealth, (dynamic) false-data injection and replay attacks. First, we characterize fundamental limitations of static, dynamic, and active monitors for attack detection and identification. Second, we provide constructive algebraic conditions to cast undetectable and unidentifiable attacks. Third, by using the system interconnection structure, we describe graph-theoretic conditions for the existence of undetectable and unidentifiable attacks. Finally, we validate our findings through some illustrative examples with different cyber-physical systems, such as a municipal water supply network and two electrical power grids.",2012-02-28T08:07:43Z,2012-03-10T01:44:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6144v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.6144v2,"math.OC, cs.SY"

But, strangely, concerning Physics, a paradox which we call the Memory Paradox has remained yet undiscovered, despite its simplicity and remarkable consequences, mostly in Physics and surprisingly in classical Physics that appear to be non deterministic, contrary to the general belief since Newton, Laplace, etc..

Testing new physics with the electron g-2,"G. F. Giudice, P. Paradisi, M. Passera","We argue that the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (a_e) can be used to probe new physics. We show that the present bound on new-physics contributions to a_e is 8*10^-13, but the sensitivity can be improved by about an order of magnitude with new measurements of a_e and more refined determinations of alpha in atomic-physics experiments. Tests on new-physics effects in a_e can play a crucial role in the interpretation of the observed discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (a_mu). In a large class of models, new contributions to magnetic moments scale with the square of lepton masses and thus the anomaly in a_mu suggests a new-physics effect in a_e of (0.7 +- 0.2)*10^-13. We also present examples of new-physics theories in which this scaling is violated and larger effects in a_e are expected. In such models the value of a_e is correlated with specific predictions for processes with violation of lepton number or lepton universality, and with the electric dipole moment of the electron.",2012-08-31T19:19:58Z,2012-11-16T19:25:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6583v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.6583v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex"

We show that within our model these paradoxes are resolved.,2013-05-27T13:48:13Z,2013-05-27T13:48:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6219v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6219v1,quant-ph

Physical Relativism as an Interpretation of Existence,Stuart Heinrich,"Despite the success of modern physics in formulating mathematical theories that can predict the outcome of quantum-scale experiments, the physical interpretations of these theories remain controversial. In this manuscript, we propose a new interpretation of existence that we call physical relativism. Under physical relativism, the difference between mathematical existence and physical existence is clarified, and Wheeler's `it from bit' viewpoint can be objectively evaluated. In addition, physical relativism provides a simple answer to the question of why the universe exists at all, and permits us to derive the maximally biophilic principle, a generalization of the anthropic principle that ascribes high prior likelihood to the observation of a universe with simple physical laws supporting the overall concepts of time, space and the emergent evolution of life.",2013-06-23T23:00:23Z,2013-12-05T23:43:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5484v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.5484v2,physics.hist-ph

Physical security often requires either restricting access to the channel or performing periodic manual inspections. In this tutorial, we describe how the field of quantum communication offers new techniques for securing the physical layer. We describe the use of quantum seals as a unique way to test the integrity and authenticity of a communication channel and to provide security for the physical layer. We present the theoretical and physical underpinnings of quantum seals including the quantum optical encoding used at the transmitter and the test for non-locality used at the receiver. We describe how the envisioned quantum physical sublayer senses tampering and how coordination with higher protocol layers allow quantum seals to influence secure routing or tailor data management methods. We conclude by discussing challenges in the development of quantum seals, the overlap with existing quantum key distribution cryptographic services, and the relevance of a quantum physical sublayer to the future of communication security.",2014-07-16T21:57:13Z,2014-07-16T21:57:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4509v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4509v1,quant-ph

Kinesthetic activities in physics instruction: Image schematic   justification and design based on didactic situations,"Jesper Bruun, Frederik V. Christiansen","One of the major difficulties in learning physics is for students to develop a conceptual understanding of the core concepts of physics. Many authors have argued that student conceptions of basic physical phenomena are rooted in basic schemas, originating in fundamental kinesthetic experiences of being. If central schemas have a bodily basis, this idea should be utilized in physics instruction. Thus, we argue that kinesthetic activities, including careful experiential and conceptual analysis will provide useful entry point for student acquisition of the basic conceptions of physics, and can overcome the phenomenological gap between the experiential and the conceptual understanding. We discuss the nature of image schemas and focus particularly on one: effort-resistance-flow. We argue that this schema is fundamental not only in our everyday experience, but also in most of school physics. We provide an example of a kinesthetic model and describe how an instructional strategy of these exercises can support student understanding and intuition with respect to central physics concepts.",2014-10-16T22:46:25Z,2014-10-16T22:46:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4602v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4602v1,physics.ed-ph

The Duhem-Quine thesis and the dark matter problem,M. A. Reynolds,"There are few opportunities in introductory physics for a genuine discussion of the philosophy of science, especially in cases where the physical principles are straightforward and the mathematics is simple. Terrestrial classical mechanics satisfies these requirements, but students new to physics usually carry too many incorrect or misleading preconceptions about the subject for it to be analyzed epistemologically. The problem of dark matter, and especially the physics of spiral galaxy velocity rotation curves, is a straightforward application of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation, and is just enough removed from everyday experience to be analyzed from a fresh perspective. It is proposed to teach students about important issues in the philosophy of physics, including Bacon's induction, Popper's falsifiability, and the Duhem-Quine thesis, all in light of the dark matter problem. These issues can be discussed in an advanced classical mechanics course, or, with limited simplification, at the end of a first course in introductory mechanics.

Examples of non-constructive proofs in quantum theory,Arkady Bolotin,"Unlike mathematics, in which the notion of truth might be abstract, in physics, the emphasis must be placed on algorithmic procedures for obtaining numerical results subject to the experimental verifiability. For, a physical science is exactly that: algorithmic procedures (built on a certain mathematical formalism) for obtaining verifiable conclusions from a set of basic hypotheses. By admitting non-constructivist statements a physical theory loses its concrete applicability and thus verifiability of its predictions. Accordingly, the requirement of constructivism must be indispensable to any physical theory. Nevertheless, in at least some physical theories, and especially in quantum mechanics, one can find examples of non-constructive statements. The present paper demonstrates a couple of such examples dealing with macroscopic quantum states (i.e., with the applicability of the standard quantum formalism to macroscopic systems). As it is shown, in these examples the proofs of the existence of macroscopic quantum states are based on logical principles allowing one to decide the truth of predicates over an infinite number of things.",2015-09-22T22:38:56Z,2015-09-22T22:38:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06801v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06801v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"

Learning optimal quantum models is NP-hard,Cyril Stark,"Physical modeling closes the gap between perception in terms of measurements and abstraction in terms of theoretical models. Physical modeling is a major objective in physics and is generally regarded as a creative process. How good are computers at solving this task? This question is both of philosophical and practical interest because a positive answer would allow an artificial intelligence to understand the physical world. Quantum mechanics is the most fundamental physical theory and there is a deep belief that nature follows the rules of quantum mechanics. Hence, we raise the question whether computers are able to learn optimal quantum models from measured data. Here we show that in the absence of physical heuristics, the inference of optimal quantum models cannot be computed efficiently (unless P = NP). This result illuminates rigorous limits to the extent to which computers can be used to further our understanding of nature.",2015-10-09T20:04:06Z,2015-10-09T20:04:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02800v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.02800v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"

Classical Zero-Point Radiation and Relativity: The Problem of Blackbody   Radiation Revisited,Timothy H. Boyer,"The physicists of the early 20th century were unaware of two ideas which are vital to understanding some aspects of modern physics within classical theory. The two ideas are: 1) the presence of classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, and 2) the importance of special relativity. In classes of modern physics today, the problem of blackbody radiation within classical physics is still described in the historical context of the early 20th century. However, the inclusion of classical zero-point radiation and of relativity now allows a completely satisfactory classical understanding of blackbody radiation with the Planck spectrum, as well as of some other aspects of modern physics. Here we sketch the current classical understanding of blackbody radiation, pointing out that thermodynamics allows the presence of classical zero-point radiation, and that use of nonrelativistic physics leads to the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum while relativistic physics gives the Planck spectrum. The current textbooks of modern physics are a century out of date in presenting the connections between classical and quantum physics.",2015-11-19T15:05:58Z,2015-11-19T15:05:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06195v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06195v1,physics.class-ph

CPDY: Extending the Dolev-Yao Attacker with Physical-Layer Interactions,"Marco Rocchetto, Nils Ole Tippenhauer","We propose extensions to the Dolev-Yao attacker model to make it suitable for arguments about security of Cyber-Physical Systems. The Dolev-Yao attacker model uses a set of rules to define potential actions by an attacker with respect to messages (i.e. information) exchanged between parties during a protocol execution. As the traditional Dolev-Yao model considers only information (exchanged over a channel controlled by the attacker), the model cannot directly be used to argue about the security of cyber-physical systems where physical-layer interactions are possible. Our Dolev-Yao extension, called cyber-physical Dolev-Yao (CPDY) attacker model, allows additional orthogonal interaction channels between the parties. In particular, such orthogonal channels can be used to model physical-layer mechanical, chemical, or electrical interactions between components. In addition, we discuss the inclusion of physical properties such as location or distance in the rule set. We present an example set of additional rules for the Dolev-Yao attacker, using those we are able to formally discover physical attacks that previously could only be found by empirical methods or detailed physical process models.",2016-07-09T02:45:15Z,2016-07-20T02:49:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02562v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02562v3,cs.CR

Complex systems: physics beyond physics,"Yurij Holovatch, Ralph Kenna, Stefan Thurner","Complex systems are characterized by specific time-dependent interactions among their many constituents. As a consequence they often manifest rich, non-trivial and unexpected behavior. Examples arise both in the physical and non-physical world. The study of complex systems forms a new interdisciplinary research area that cuts across physics, biology, ecology, economics, sociology, and the humanities. In this paper we review the essence of complex systems from a physicist's point of view, and try to clarify what makes them conceptually different from systems that are traditionally studied in physics. Our goal is to demonstrate how the dynamics of such systems may be conceptualized in quantitative and predictive terms by extending notions from statistical physics and how they can often be captured in a framework of co-evolving multiplex network structures. We mention three areas of complex-systems science that are currently studied extensively, the science of cities, dynamics of societies, and the representation of texts as evolutionary objects. We discuss why these areas form complex systems in the above sense. We argue that there exists plenty of new land for physicists to explore and that methodical and conceptual progress is needed most.",2016-09-29T22:14:16Z,2016-09-29T22:14:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01002v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01002v1,physics.soc-ph

Duff summarising the far reaching contributions of Ettore Majorana to fundamental physics, with special focus on Majorana fermions in all their guises. The theoretical discovery of the eponymous fermion in 1937 has since had profound implications for particle physics, solid state and quantum computation. The breadth of these disciplines is testimony to Majorana's genius, which continues to permeate physics today. These lectures offer a whistle-stop tour through some limited subset of the key ideas. In addition to touching on these various applications, we will draw out some fascinating relations connecting the normed division algebras $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}$ to spinors, trialities, $K$-theory and the classification of stable topological states of symmetry-protected gapped free-fermion systems.",2016-12-05T14:31:06Z,2016-12-07T20:23:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01371v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01371v2,"hep-th, cond-mat.other, cond-mat.supr-con, hep-ph, quant-ph, 81V70, 81V15, 17A75, 13D15, 81T45"

Are inequities in self-efficacy a systemic feature of physics education?,Jayson M. Nissen,"There is consistent and growing evidence that physics instruction disproportionately harms female students' self-efficacy, their beliefs about their ability to learn and do physics. This harm is problematic because self-efficacy supports student learning and persistence. Nissen and Shemwell (PhysRevPER, 12, 2016) investigated this harm using an in-the-moment measure of student's self-efficacy states, which are dynamic judgments of one's ability to succeed in the activity at hand. Their results indicated that female students experienced much lower self-efficacy states in physics than male students did, and that this gender difference did not occur in other STEM courses. A limitation of their study was that it only investigated a single college physics course. In order to further inform the generalizability of this phenomenon I analyzed a large data set of 35,464 experiences from 4,816 students at 33 secondary schools collected between 1993 and 1997 that was designed to be representative of high school students' experiences. Results confirmed that there was a large gender difference in self-efficacy states in high school physics courses and not in any other courses. The identification of this phenomenon in two very different settings indicates that physics instruction systemically harms female students' belief in their ability to learn and do physics.",2016-12-29T16:14:36Z,2016-12-29T16:14:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09188v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09188v1,physics.ed-ph
On Lagrangian description of Borel resummation,A. Milekhin,In this paper we will propose a physical interpretation of Borel resummation. We will define Borel transformation on the Lagrangian level.

In the non-perturbative sector this transformation reproduces Bogomolny--Zinn-Justin(BZJ) regularization.

Introduction of a Hybrid Monitor to Cyber-Physical Systems,"J Ceasar Aguma, Bruce McMillin, Amelia Regan","Computing and technology have vastly changed since the introduction of firewall technology in 1988. The internet has grown from a simple network of networks to a cyber and physical entity that encompasses the entire planet. Cyber-physical systems(CPS) now control most of the day to day operations of human civilization from autonomous cars to nuclear energy plants. While phenomenal, this growth spurt has created new security threats. These are threats that cannot be blocked by a firewall for they are not only cyber but cyber-physical. In light of these new cyber-physical threats, this text proposes a security measure that promises to enhance the security of cyber-physical systems. Using theoretical cyber, physical, and cyber-physical attack scenarios, this text will highlight the need for some sort of monitor in cyber-physical systems as an extra security measure. Additionally, this text will illustrate the efficiency of said monitor using a Shannon entropy proof, and a multiple security domain nondeducibility(MSDND) proof.",2018-05-05T00:31:48Z,2019-08-09T19:48:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01975v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01975v2,cs.CR
Attitude and Motivation towards Learning Physics,Ryan Manuel D. Guido,"Physics is considered as one of the most prevailing and problematic subjects by the students in the realm of science. Students perceived physics as a difficult subject during high school days and become more evasive when they reach college. Based on an investigation of 446 engineering and technology students, this study analyses and evaluates the relationship between attitude and motivation of engineering and technology students towards learning physics. It shows that there is no significant difference in the attitude and motivation of students towards learning physics. Furthermore, there is a negligible degree of relationship for attitude and motivation. The relationship between attitude and motivation is due to chance. This confides that most students found that is unlikely for them to enjoy learning physics because of their professor. Faculty should encourage students in drilling physics problems, students are found to like answering difficult physics questions in ever examination, expresses that they have a mathematical mind.",2018-05-06T23:26:27Z,2018-05-06T23:26:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02293v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02293v1,physics.ed-ph

A framework for the natures of negativity in introductory physics,"Suzanne White Brahmia, Alexis Olsho, Trevor I. Smith, Andrew Boudreaux","Mathematical reasoning skills are a desired outcome of many introductory physics courses, particularly calculus-based physics courses. Positive and negative quantities are ubiquitous in physics, and the sign carries important and varied meanings. Novices can struggle to understand the many roles signed numbers play in physics contexts, and recent evidence shows that unresolved struggle can carry over to subsequent physics courses. The mathematics education research literature documents the cognitive challenge of conceptualizing negative numbers as mathematical objects--both for experts, historically, and for novices as they learn. We contribute to the small but growing body of research in physics contexts that examines student reasoning about signed quantities and reasoning about the use and interpretation of signs in mathematical models. In this paper we present a framework for categorizing various meanings and interpretations of the negative sign in physics contexts, inspired by established work in algebra contexts from the mathematics education research community. Such a framework can support innovation that can catalyze deeper mathematical conceptualizations of signed quantities in the introductory courses and beyond.",2019-03-09T14:07:27Z,2019-03-09T14:07:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03806v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03806v1,physics.ed-ph

Physics Successfully Implements Lagrange Multiplier Optimization,"Sri Krishna Vadlamani, Tianyao Patrick Xiao, Eli Yablonovitch","Optimization is a major part of human effort. While being mathematical, optimization is also built into physics. For example, physics has the principle of Least Action, the principle of Minimum Entropy Generation, and the Variational Principle. Physics also has physical annealing which, of course, preceded computational Simulated Annealing. Physics has the Adiabatic Principle, which in its quantum form is called Quantum Annealing. Thus, physical machines can solve the mathematical problem of optimization, including constraints. Binary constraints can be built into the physical optimization. In that case the machines are digital in the same sense that a flip-flop is digital. A wide variety of machines have had recent success at optimizing the Ising magnetic energy. We demonstrate in this paper that almost all those machines perform optimization according to the Principle of Minimum Entropy Generation as put forth by Onsager. Further, we show that this optimization is in fact equivalent to Lagrange multiplier optimization for constrained problems. We find that the physical gain coefficients which drive those systems actually play the role of the corresponding Lagrange Multipliers.",2020-07-12T01:25:33Z,2020-07-21T20:08:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05882v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05882v2,cs.ET

"Observers, observations and referencing in physics theories",Uri Ben-Ya'acov,"Is it possible to encompass the full extent of the universe within a theory based on a finite set of first principles and inference rules?   The r\^{o}le of observers and observations in physics theories is considered here in the light of G\""{o}del's incompleteness theorem. Physics theories are the sum-total that we -- humans, scientists, physicists -- can make in interpreting our observations of the universe. We are integral part of the universe, together with our observations, therefore acts of observation are also observables and should become part of the phenomena considered by the theory, especially in view of the fact that arbitrarily chosen modes of observations may essentially determine empirical results.   Incompleteness arises in G\""{o}del's theorem with self-referential propositions. Observations and interpretations are acts of referencing, and self-referencing occurs in physics whenever the observer is recognized as being part of the observed system. If self-reference appears in physics in simile to G\""{o}del's theorem, then incompleteness seems unavoidable in physics.   The article discusses observers and observations as referencing in physics, culminating with the understanding that they are hierarchically inter-related so that a universal physics theory cannot be complete.",2020-07-26T00:28:29Z,2021-03-22T21:19:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13036v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13036v3,physics.hist-ph

Their knowledge is essential for the proper handling and understanding of current problems in physics. They are also related to the art of scientific computing in physics and mathematics. Special functions are included in many computer algebra software such as Matlab, Mathematica, and Maple, and students are strongly encouraged to take part in this development which has become indispensable for the treatment of almost all current problems in physics.

Dimensioned Algebra: the mathematics of physical quantities,Carlos Zapata-Carratala,"A rigorous mathematical theory of dimensional analysis, systematically accounting for the use of physical quantities in science and engineering, perhaps surprisingly, was not developed until relatively recently. We claim that this has shaped current mathematical models of theoretical physics, which generally lack any explicit reference to units of measurement, and we propose a novel mathematical framework to alleviate this. Our proposal is a generalization of the usual categories of algebraic structures used to formulate physical theories (groups, rings, vector spaces...), herein dubbed dimensioned, that can naturally articulate the structure of physical dimension. Our goal in the present work is not so much to define an algebraic theory of physical quantities - this has already been done - but to define a theory of algebra informed by how physical quantities are used in practice. We conclude by studying the dimensioned analogue of Poisson algebras in some detail due to their relevance in Jacobi geometry and classical mechanics.

Using this method, we mainly study the standard nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation and predict various data-driven optical soliton solutions, including one-soliton, soliton molecules, two-soliton interaction, and rogue wave.

Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy in the Research on the Foundations of Quantum   Physics: E. P. Wigner's Case,Olival Freire Jr,"Dealing with Eugene Wigner's ideas on the measurement procedure in quantum physics and unearthing the controversy that pitted him against supporters of the interpretation of complementarity, I will show how Wigner and his followers contributed to the defeat of a seemingly unshakeable consensus. In fact, although he intended to defend what seemed to him to be orthodoxy, he himself became a heterodox. I suggest that Wigner's conjectures on the role of consciousness in physical phenomena were not fruitful and were discarded, being today part of the history of physics rather than physics proper. However, his ideas and actions left an indelible mark on the physics of the second half of the 20th century. Namely, he formulated his ideas in opposition to the Copenhagen monocracy, which held a stronghold on the interpretation of quantum physics until the late 1960s; he stressed the unsolved status of the measurement problem; and he effectively defended his ideas and supported those who were willing to investigate the foundations of quantum physics. He thus contributed to the creation of a new field of physical research, that of the foundations of quantum physics, which attributed a higher scientific status to the old controversy on the interpretations and foundations of this theory. This new field has had to deal with important theoretical, experimental, and philosophical issues, and significant repercussions have arisen in the last decades.",2006-02-04T02:32:25Z,2007-12-07T19:44:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0602028v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0602028v3,physics.hist-ph
"Harmonic Oscillators as Bridges between Theories: Einstein, Dirac, and   Feynman","Y. S. Kim, Marilyn E. Noz","Other than scattering problems where perturbation theory is applicable, there are basically two ways to solve problems in physics. One is to reduce the problem to harmonic oscillators, and the other is to formulate the problem in terms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem combines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then becomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics. Indeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated into another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators provide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics, including entanglement, decoherence, and Feynman's rest of the universe. In addition, it is noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a physics of harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the Lorentz group which can be represented by the group of by two-by-two matrices commonly called $SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can therefore play the role of combining quantum mechanics with special relativity. Both Paul A. M. Dirac and Richard P. Feynman were fond of harmonic oscillators, while they used different approaches to physical problems. Both were also keenly interested in making quantum mechanics compatible with special relativity. It is shown that the coupled harmonic oscillators can bridge these two different approaches to physics.",2004-11-02T16:18:39Z,2004-11-02T16:18:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411017v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0411017v1,"quant-ph, hep-ph, hep-th"
Physicalism versus quantum mechanics,Henry P. Stapp,"In the context of theories of the connection between mind and brain, physicalism is the demand that all is basically purely physical. But the concept of ""physical"" embodied in this demand is characterized essentially by the properties of the physical that hold in classical physical theories. Certain of these properties contradict the character of the physical in quantum mechanics, which provides a better, more comprehensive, and more fundamental account of phenomena. It is argued that the difficulties that have plaged physicalists for half a century, and that continue to do so, dissolve when the classical idea of the physical is replaced by its quantum successor. The argument is concretized in a way that makes it accessible to non-physicists by exploiting the recent evidence connecting our conscious experiences to macroscopic measurable synchronous oscillations occurring in well-separated parts of the brain. A specific new model of the mind-brain connection that is fundamentally quantum mechanical but that ties conscious experiences to these macroscopic synchronous oscillations is used to illustrate the essential disparities between the classical and quantum notions of the physical, and in particular to demonstrate the failure in the quantum world of the principle of the causal closure of the physical, a failure that goes beyond what is entailed by the randomness in the outcomes of observations, and that accommodates the efficacy in the brain of conscious intent.",2008-03-11T16:25:01Z,2008-03-11T16:25:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1625v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.1625v1,physics.gen-ph

The Descent of Math,Sara Imari Walker,"A perplexing problem in understanding physical reality is why the universe seems comprehensible, and correspondingly why there should exist physical systems capable of comprehending it. In this essay I explore the possibility that rather than being an odd coincidence arising due to our strange position as passive (and even more strangely, conscious) observers in the cosmos, these two problems might be related and could be explainable in terms of fundamental physics. The perspective presented suggests a potential unified framework where, when taken together, comprehenders and comprehensibility are part of causal structure of physical reality, which is considered as a causal graph (network) connecting states that are physically possible. I argue that in some local regions, the most probable states are those that include physical systems which contain information encodings - such as mathematics, language and art - because these are the most highly connected to other possible states in this causal graph. Such physical systems include life and - of particular interest for the discussion of the place of math in physical reality - comprehenders capable of making mathematical sense of the world. Within this framework, the descent of math is an undirected outcome of the evolution of the universe, which will tend toward states that are increasingly connected to other possible states of the universe, a process greatly facilitated if some physical systems know the rules of the game. I therefore conclude that our ability to use mathematics to describe, and more importantly manipulate, the natural world may not be an anomaly or trick, but instead could provide clues to the underlying causal structure of physical reality.",2015-05-02T05:00:57Z,2015-11-09T05:06:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00312v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00312v2,physics.hist-ph

Investigating how students collaborate to generate physics problems   through structured tasks,"Javier Pulgar, Alexis Spina, Carlos Ríos","Traditionally, scholars in physics education research pay attention to students solving well-structured learning activities, which provide restricted room for collaboration and idea-generation due to their close-ended nature. In order to encourage the socialization of information among group members, we utilized a real-world problem where students were asked to generate a well-structured physics task, and investigated how student groups collaborated to create physics problems for younger students at an introductory physics course at a university in northern Chile. Data collection consists of audio recording the group discussions while they were collaborating to develop their physics problems as well as the solutions they created to their problems. Through interviews, we accessed students' perceptions on the task and its challenges. Results suggest that generating problems is an opportunity for students to propose ideas and make decisions regarding the goals of the problem, concepts and procedures, contextual details and magnitudes and units to introduce in their generated problems. In addition, we found evidence that groups tested the validity of their creations by engaging in strategies often observed with algebra-based physics problems, such as mathematical procedures and qualitative descriptions of the physics embedded in the problem, yet groups invested more time with algebra-based strategies compared to more qualitative descriptions. Students valued the open-ended nature of the task and recognized its benefits in utilizing physics ideas into context, which in turn enabled collaboration in a way not experienced with traditional algebra-based problems. These findings support the use of generative activities as a pathway for students to engage in real-world physics problems that allow for a range and variety of collective processes and ideas.",2020-03-30T02:55:09Z,2020-03-30T02:55:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13196v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13196v1,physics.ed-ph
SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in 3D   Environments,"Jiafei Duan, Samson Yu Bai Jian, Cheston Tan","Recent advancements in deep learning, computer vision, and embodied AI have given rise to synthetic causal reasoning video datasets. These datasets facilitate the development of AI algorithms that can reason about physical interactions between objects. However, datasets thus far have primarily focused on elementary physical events such as rolling or falling. There is currently a scarcity of datasets that focus on the physical interactions that humans perform daily with objects in the real world. To address this scarcity, we introduce SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in 3D Environments. The SPACE simulator allows us to generate the SPACE dataset, a synthetic video dataset in a 3D environment, to systematically evaluate physics-based models on a range of physical causal reasoning tasks. Inspired by daily object interactions, the SPACE dataset comprises videos depicting three types of physical events: containment, stability and contact. These events make up the vast majority of the basic physical interactions between objects. We then further evaluate it with a state-of-the-art physics-based deep model and show that the SPACE dataset improves the learning of intuitive physics with an approach inspired by curriculum learning.

"Typical Physics PhD Admissions Criteria Limit Access to Underrepresented   Groups but Fail to Predict Doctoral Completion, including some additional   information","Casey W. Miller, Benjamin M. Zwickl, Julie R. Posselt, Rachel T. Silvestrini, Theodore Hodapp","This work aims to understand how effective the typical admissions criteria used in physics are at identifying students who will complete the PhD. Through a multivariate statistical analysis of a sample that includes roughly one in eight students who entered physics PhD programs from 2000-2010, we find that the traditional admissions metrics of undergraduate GPA and the Graduate Records Examination (GRE) Quantitative, Verbal, and Physics Subject Tests do not predict completion in US physics graduate programs with the efficacy often assumed by admissions committees. We find only undergraduate GPA to have a statistically significant association with physics PhD completion across all models studied. In no model did GRE Physics or GRE Verbal predict PhD completion. GRE Quantitative scores had statistically significant relationships with PhD completion in two of four models studied. However, in practice, probability of completing the PhD changed by less than 10 percentage points for students scoring in the 10 ^th vs 90 ^th percentile of US test takers that were physics majors. Noting the significant race, gender, and citizenship gaps in GRE scores, these findings indicate that the heavy reliance on these test scores within typical PhD admissions process is a deterrent to increasing access, diversity, and equity in physics. Misuse of GRE scores selects against already-underrepresented groups and US citizens with tools that fail to meaningfully predict PhD completion.

Quantum-Entropy Physics,"Davi Geiger, Zvi M. Kedem","All the laws of physics are time-reversible. Time arrow emerges only when ensembles of classical particles are treated probabilistically, outside of physics laws, and the entropy and the second law of thermodynamics are introduced. In quantum physics, no mechanism for a time arrow has been proposed despite its intrinsic probabilistic nature. In consequence, one cannot explain why an electron in an excited state will ""spontaneously"" transition into a ground state as a photon is created and emitted, instead of continuing in its reversible unitary evolution. To address such phenomena, we introduce an entropy for quantum physics, which will conduce to the emergence of a time arrow.   The entropy is a measure of randomness over the degrees of freedom of a quantum state. It is dimensionless; it is a relativistic scalar, it is invariant under coordinate transformation of position and momentum that maintain conjugate properties and under CPT transformations; and its minimum is positive due to the uncertainty principle.   To excogitate why some quantum physical processes cannot take place even though they obey conservation laws, we partition the set of all evolutions of an initial state into four blocks, based on whether the entropy is (i) increasing but not a constant, (ii) decreasing but not a constant, (iii) a constant, (iv) oscillating. We propose a law that in quantum physics entropy (weakly) increases over time. Thus, evolutions in the set (ii) are disallowed, and evolutions in set (iv) are barred from completing an oscillation period by instantaneously transitioning to a new state. This law for quantum physics limits physical scenarios beyond conservation laws, providing causality reasoning by defining a time arrow.",2021-03-14T18:50:14Z,2021-03-14T18:50:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07996v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07996v1,"quant-ph, hep-th"
Impact of Detector Simulation in Particle Physics Collider Experiments,V. Daniel Elvira,"Through the last three decades, accurate simulation of the interactions of particles with matter and modeling of detector geometries has proven to be of critical importance to the success of the international high-energy physics (HEP) experimental programs. For example, the detailed detector modeling and accurate physics of the Geant4-based simulation software of the CMS and ATLAS particle physics experiments at the European Center of Nuclear Research (CERN) Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was a determinant factor for these collaborations to deliver physics results of outstanding quality faster than any hadron collider experiment ever before.   This review article highlights the impact of detector simulation on particle physics collider experiments. It presents numerous examples of the use of simulation, from detector design and optimization, through software and computing development and testing, to cases where the use of simulation samples made a difference in the precision of the physics results and publication turnaround, from data-taking to submission. It also presents estimates of the cost and economic impact of simulation in the CMS experiment.   Future experiments will collect orders of magnitude more data with increasingly complex detectors, taxing heavily the performance of simulation and reconstruction software. Consequently, exploring solutions to speed up simulation and reconstruction software to satisfy the growing demand of computing resources in a time of flat budgets is a matter that deserves immediate attention. The article ends with a short discussion on the potential solutions that are being considered, based on leveraging core count growth in multicore machines, using new generation coprocessors, and re-engineering HEP code for concurrency and parallel computing.",2017-06-14T01:41:33Z,2017-06-14T01:41:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04293v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04293v1,"hep-ex, physics.ins-det"
The solution of the Sixth Hilbert Problem: the Ultimate Galilean   Revolution,Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano,"I argue for a full mathematisation of the physical theory, including its axioms, which must contain no physical primitives. In provocative words: ""physics from no physics"". Although this may seem an oxymoron, it is the royal road to keep complete logical coherence, hence falsifiability of the theory. For such a purely mathematical theory the physical connotation must pertain only the interpretation of the mathematics, ranging from the axioms to the final theorems. On the contrary, the postulates of the two current major physical theories either don't have physical interpretation (as for von Neumann's axioms for quantum theory), or contain physical primitives as ""clock"", ""rigid rod "", ""force"", ""inertial mass"" (as for special relativity and mechanics). A purely mathematical theory as proposed here, though with limited (but relentlessly growing) domain of applicability, will have the eternal validity of mathematical truth. It will be a theory on which natural sciences can firmly rely. Such kind of theory is what I consider to be the solution of the Sixth Hilbert's Problem. I argue that a prototype example of such a mathematical theory is provided by the novel algorithmic paradigm for physics, as in the recent information-theoretical derivation of quantum theory and free quantum field theory.",2018-01-29T15:09:35Z,2018-01-29T15:09:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09561v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09561v1,"quant-ph, hep-th"

Schools on different corners: An investigation into the effects of   ethnicity and socioeconomic status on physics offerings in Northern   California public high schools,"David Marasco, Bree Barnett Dreyfuss","In the spring of 2018 the Northern California/Nevada section of the American Association of Physics Teachers was alerted to a local high school's plans to eliminate physics for the following school year. As part of the campaign to support the school's efforts to sustain physics in the following year, the physics offerings from the surrounding schools in that district were compiled. It appeared that the demographics of the student population in the district played a role in the number of different physics courses offered within that district, particularly the percentage of Hispanic students (%Hispanic) and percentage of socioeconomically disadvantaged (%SED) students at each school. Concerned that this trend was more widespread, physics course offerings were reviewed for Northern California public high schools to determine if there were correlations between the amount of different physics class offerings and these populations. It was found that %Hispanic and %SED are strongly correlated in California public schools, and along with number of students, could be used as statistically significant predictors of a school's physics offerings.",2020-10-16T16:23:59Z,2021-06-10T01:59:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08476v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08476v4,physics.ed-ph
Physical Implementability of Linear Maps and Its Application in Error   Mitigation,"Jiaqing Jiang, Kun Wang, Xin Wang","Completely positive and trace-preserving maps characterize physically implementable quantum operations. On the other hand, general linear maps, such as positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically implemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in theoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well one can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by physically implementable operations. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to resolve this task using the quasiprobability decomposition technique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of physically implementable operations and introduce the physical implementability measure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must pertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using physically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is efficiently computable by semidefinite programs and prove several properties of this measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests. Furthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the quantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the sampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique. In particular, for parallel quantum noises, we show that global error mitigation has no advantage over local error mitigation.",2020-12-20T16:03:09Z,2021-12-02T08:38:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10959v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10959v2,"quant-ph, cs.IT, hep-th, math-ph, math.IT, math.MP"
AdjointNet: Constraining machine learning models with physics-based   codes,"Satish Karra, Bulbul Ahmmed, Maruti K. Mudunuru","Physics-informed Machine Learning has recently become attractive for learning physical parameters and features from simulation and observation data. However, most existing methods do not ensure that the physics, such as balance laws (e.g., mass, momentum, energy conservation), are constrained. Some recent works (e.g., physics-informed neural networks) softly enforce physics constraints by including partial differential equation (PDE)-based loss functions but need re-discretization of the PDEs using auto-differentiation. Training these neural nets on observational data showed that one could solve forward and inverse problems in one shot. They evaluate the state variables and the parameters in a PDE. This re-discretization of PDEs is not necessarily an attractive option for domain scientists that work with physics-based codes that have been developed for decades with sophisticated discretization techniques to solve complex process models and advanced equations of state. This paper proposes a physics constrained machine learning framework, AdjointNet, allowing domain scientists to embed their physics code in neural network training workflows. This embedding ensures that physics is constrained everywhere in the domain. Additionally, the mathematical properties such as consistency, stability, and convergence vital to the numerical solution of a PDE are still satisfied. We show that the proposed AdjointNet framework can be used for parameter estimation (and uncertainty quantification by extension) and experimental design using active learning. The applicability of our framework is demonstrated for four flow cases. Results show that AdjointNet-based inversion can estimate process model parameters with reasonable accuracy. These examples demonstrate the applicability of using existing software with no changes in source code to perform accurate and reliable inversion of model parameters.",2021-09-08T22:43:44Z,2021-09-08T22:43:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03956v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03956v1,"math.NA, cs.LG, cs.NA, physics.comp-ph, physics.flu-dyn"
Do female physics students benefit from informal physics programs they   facilitate?,"Jessi Randolph, Jonathan Perry, Jonan Phillip Donaldson, Callie Rethman, Tatiana Erukhimova","Gender bias, reduced sense of belonging, and lower physics self-efficacy are among the challenges faced by female students who choose to study physics. Prior studies focusing on this underrepresented group have examined the experiences and impacts of formal educational settings, leaving the impact of informal physics programs as a relatively overlooked area. Existing research on the impact of informal physics programs indicates that student facilitators, who help run the programs, can experience positive impacts on their learning and sense of community beyond the formal setting of a classroom or laboratory. In this study we took a first step, narrowing our focus to explore the relation between facilitation of informal physics programs and female students' physics identity, persistence, mindset, and worldview. We analyzed survey responses (32) and interviews (11) collected from undergraduate and graduate female students at a large, land-grant university. Our results, based on self-reported data, showed a statistically significant shift in confidence of choice of major after facilitating informal physics programs. Analysis of interviews indicated a positive effect of facilitation of informal programs on female student interest and motivation with regards to the field of physics, improved performance and competence beliefs, and the development of characteristics indicative of a growth mindset. A semantic network analysis showed statistically significant interdependencies between positive persistence and constructs including growth mindset, important early undergraduate experiences, gender stereotype threat, external recognition, and confidence.",2021-10-25T20:49:24Z,2021-10-25T20:49:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13258v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13258v1,physics.ed-ph
An introduction to Goldstone boson physics and to the coset construction,Daniel Naegels,"These lecture notes are based on a six-hour series of lectures given at the XVII Modave summer school in mathematical physics, aimed at Ph.D. students in high-energy theoretical physics.   The manuscript starts by briefly stating Goldstone's theorem and emphasises the motivations behind Goldstone physics; the main asset being the universality of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) which is the fundamental hypothesis of Goldstone's theorem. Once the different notions of SSB will be clarified/reviewed, Goldstone's theorem will be stated and proved. A prediction of this theorem is the existence of gapless particles, called Nambu-Goldstone modes (NG modes). From the discussion on Goldstone's results, some aspects of the NG modes will emerge. Besides to be gapless, they are systematically weakly coupled at low energy. Therefore, an effective field theory (EFT) building tool called ``coset construction'' will be presented to explicitly display these specific features of the NG modes. The coset construction suits our goal since it is mainly based on the symmetry realisation of the perturbed theory around the background inducing SSB. From the general obtained EFT, a counting rule for the NG modes will be derived. The limitations of this rule as well as the still ongoing generalisation will be discussed (e.g. spacetime symmetry breaking). The tools developed during this course will be illustrated with a concrete example in physics: ferromagnetism. The notes end with a brief state of the art of Goldstone physics. This provides some directions into which the interested reader could investigate to expand his knowledge on the subject.

Phy-Taylor: Physics-Model-Based Deep Neural Networks,"Yanbing Mao, Lui Sha, Huajie Shao, Yuliang Gu, Qixin Wang, Tarek Abdelzaher","Purely data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to physical engineering systems can infer relations that violate physics laws, thus leading to unexpected consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-model-based DNN framework, called Phy-Taylor, that accelerates learning compliant representations with physical knowledge. The Phy-Taylor framework makes two key contributions; it introduces a new architectural Physics-compatible neural network (PhN), and features a novel compliance mechanism, we call {\em Physics-guided Neural Network Editing\}. The PhN aims to directly capture nonlinearities inspired by physical quantities, such as kinetic energy, potential energy, electrical power, and aerodynamic drag force. To do so, the PhN augments neural network layers with two key components: (i) monomials of Taylor series expansion of nonlinear functions capturing physical knowledge, and (ii) a suppressor for mitigating the influence of noise. The neural-network editing mechanism further modifies network links and activation functions consistently with physical knowledge. As an extension, we also propose a self-correcting Phy-Taylor framework that introduces two additional capabilities: (i) physics-model-based safety relationship learning, and (ii) automatic output correction when violations of safety occur. Through experiments, we show that (by expressing hard-to-learn nonlinearities directly and by constraining dependencies) Phy-Taylor features considerably fewer parameters, and a remarkably accelerated training process, while offering enhanced model robustness and accuracy.",2022-09-27T16:30:35Z,2022-11-03T04:44:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13511v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13511v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
PhysDiff: Physics-Guided Human Motion Diffusion Model,"Ye Yuan, Jiaming Song, Umar Iqbal, Arash Vahdat, Jan Kautz","Denoising diffusion models hold great promise for generating diverse and realistic human motions. However, existing motion diffusion models largely disregard the laws of physics in the diffusion process and often generate physically-implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating, foot sliding, and ground penetration. This seriously impacts the quality of generated motions and limits their real-world application. To address this issue, we present a novel physics-guided motion diffusion model (PhysDiff), which incorporates physical constraints into the diffusion process. Specifically, we propose a physics-based motion projection module that uses motion imitation in a physics simulator to project the denoised motion of a diffusion step to a physically-plausible motion. The projected motion is further used in the next diffusion step to guide the denoising diffusion process. Intuitively, the use of physics in our model iteratively pulls the motion toward a physically-plausible space, which cannot be achieved by simple post-processing. Experiments on large-scale human motion datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion quality and improves physical plausibility drastically (>78% for all datasets).",2022-12-05T18:59:52Z,2023-08-18T19:59:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02500v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02500v3,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.GR, cs.LG"
Deep symbolic regression for physics guided by units constraints: toward   the automated discovery of physical laws,"Wassim Tenachi, Rodrigo Ibata, Foivos I. Diakogiannis","Symbolic Regression is the study of algorithms that automate the search for analytic expressions that fit data. While recent advances in deep learning have generated renewed interest in such approaches, the development of symbolic regression methods has not been focused on physics, where we have important additional constraints due to the units associated with our data. Here we present $\Phi$-SO, a Physical Symbolic Optimization framework for recovering analytical symbolic expressions from physics data using deep reinforcement learning techniques by learning units constraints. Our system is built, from the ground up, to propose solutions where the physical units are consistent by construction. This is useful not only in eliminating physically impossible solutions, but because the ""grammatical"" rules of dimensional analysis restrict enormously the freedom of the equation generator, thus vastly improving performance. The algorithm can be used to fit noiseless data, which can be useful for instance when attempting to derive an analytical property of a physical model, and it can also be used to obtain analytical approximations to noisy data. We test our machinery on a standard benchmark of equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics and other physics textbooks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the presence of noise (exceeding 0.1%) and show that it is robust even in the presence of substantial (10%) noise. We showcase its abilities on a panel of examples from astrophysics.",2023-03-06T16:47:59Z,2023-10-09T15:05:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03192v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03192v2,"astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.comp-ph"
Physics-Guided Human Motion Capture with Pose Probability Modeling,"Jingyi Ju, Buzhen Huang, Chen Zhu, Zhihao Li, Yangang Wang","Incorporating physics in human motion capture to avoid artifacts like floating, foot sliding, and ground penetration is a promising direction. Existing solutions always adopt kinematic results as reference motions, and the physics is treated as a post-processing module. However, due to the depth ambiguity, monocular motion capture inevitably suffers from noises, and the noisy reference often leads to failure for physics-based tracking. To address the obstacles, our key-idea is to employ physics as denoising guidance in the reverse diffusion process to reconstruct physically plausible human motion from a modeled pose probability distribution. Specifically, we first train a latent gaussian model that encodes the uncertainty of 2D-to-3D lifting to facilitate reverse diffusion. Then, a physics module is constructed to track the motion sampled from the distribution. The discrepancies between the tracked motion and image observation are used to provide explicit guidance for the reverse diffusion model to refine the motion. With several iterations, the physics-based tracking and kinematic denoising promote each other to generate a physically plausible human motion. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous physics-based methods in both joint accuracy and success rate.

A Survey on Physics Informed Reinforcement Learning: Review and Open   Problems,"Chayan Banerjee, Kien Nguyen, Clinton Fookes, Maziar Raissi","The inclusion of physical information in machine learning frameworks has revolutionized many application areas. This involves enhancing the learning process by incorporating physical constraints and adhering to physical laws. In this work we explore their utility for reinforcement learning applications. We present a thorough review of the literature on incorporating physics information, as known as physics priors, in reinforcement learning approaches, commonly referred to as physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL). We introduce a novel taxonomy with the reinforcement learning pipeline as the backbone to classify existing works, compare and contrast them, and derive crucial insights. Existing works are analyzed with regard to the representation/ form of the governing physics modeled for integration, their specific contribution to the typical reinforcement learning architecture, and their connection to the underlying reinforcement learning pipeline stages. We also identify core learning architectures and physics incorporation biases (i.e., observational, inductive and learning) of existing PIRL approaches and use them to further categorize the works for better understanding and adaptation. By providing a comprehensive perspective on the implementation of the physics-informed capability, the taxonomy presents a cohesive approach to PIRL. It identifies the areas where this approach has been applied, as well as the gaps and opportunities that exist. Additionally, the taxonomy sheds light on unresolved issues and challenges, which can guide future research.

We first summarise existing research on the performance of a popular LLM-based chatbot (ChatGPT) on physics tasks. We then give a basic account of how LLMs work, illustrate essential features of their functioning, and discuss their strengths and limitations. Equipped with this knowledge, we discuss some challenges with generating useful output with ChatGPT-4 in the context of introductory physics, paying special attention to conceptual questions and problems. We then provide a condensed overview of relevant literature on prompt engineering and demonstrate through illustrative examples how selected prompt-engineering techniques can be employed to improve ChatGPT-4's output on conceptual introductory physics problems. Qualitatively studying these examples provides additional insights into ChatGPT's functioning and its utility in physics problem solving.

DeepPhysiNet: Bridging Deep Learning and Atmospheric Physics for   Accurate and Continuous Weather Modeling,"Wenyuan Li, Zili Liu, Keyan Chen, Hao Chen, Shunlin Liang, Zhengxia Zou, Zhenwei Shi","Accurate weather forecasting holds significant importance to human activities. Currently, there are two paradigms for weather forecasting: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and Deep Learning-based Prediction (DLP). NWP utilizes atmospheric physics for weather modeling but suffers from poor data utilization and high computational costs, while DLP can learn weather patterns from vast amounts of data directly but struggles to incorporate physical laws. Both paradigms possess their respective strengths and weaknesses, and are incompatible, because physical laws adopted in NWP describe the relationship between coordinates and meteorological variables, while DLP directly learns the relationships between meteorological variables without consideration of coordinates. To address these problems, we introduce the DeepPhysiNet framework, incorporating physical laws into deep learning models for accurate and continuous weather system modeling. First, we construct physics networks based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for individual meteorological variable, such as temperature, pressure, and wind speed. Physics networks establish relationships between variables and coordinates by taking coordinates as input and producing variable values as output. The physical laws in the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) can be incorporated as a part of loss function. Next, we construct hyper-networks based on deep learning methods to directly learn weather patterns from a large amount of meteorological data. The output of hyper-networks constitutes a part of the weights for the physics networks. Experimental results demonstrate that, upon successful integration of physical laws, DeepPhysiNet can accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously, not only enhancing forecast accuracy but also obtaining continuous spatiotemporal resolution results, which is unattainable by either the NWP or DLP.",2024-01-04T05:05:16Z,2024-01-04T05:05:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04125v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04125v1,"physics.ao-ph, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Multi-fidelity physics constrained neural networks for dynamical systems,"Hao Zhou, Sibo Cheng, Rossella Arcucci","Physics-constrained neural networks are commonly employed to enhance prediction robustness compared to purely data-driven models, achieved through the inclusion of physical constraint losses during the model training process. However, one of the major challenges of physics-constrained neural networks consists of the training complexity especially for high-dimensional systems. In fact, conventional physics-constrained models rely on singular-fidelity data necessitating the assessment of physical constraints within high-dimensional fields, which introduces computational difficulties. Furthermore, due to the fixed input size of the neural networks, employing multi-fidelity training data can also be cumbersome. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Scale Physics-Constrained Neural Network (MSPCNN), which offers a novel methodology for incorporating data with different levels of fidelity into a unified latent space through a customised multi-fidelity autoencoder. Additionally, multiple decoders are concurrently trained to map latent representations of inputs into various fidelity physical spaces. As a result, during the training of predictive models, physical constraints can be evaluated within low-fidelity spaces, yielding a trade-off between training efficiency and accuracy. In addition, unlike conventional methods, MSPCNN also manages to employ multi-fidelity data to train the predictive model. We assess the performance of MSPCNN in two fluid dynamics problems, namely a two-dimensional Burgers' system and a shallow water system. Numerical results clearly demonstrate the enhancement of prediction accuracy and noise robustness when introducing physical constraints in low-fidelity fields. On the other hand, as expected, the training complexity can be significantly reduced by computing physical constraint loss in the low-fidelity field rather than the high-fidelity one.",2024-02-03T05:05:26Z,2024-02-03T05:05:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02031v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02031v1,"cs.LG, physics.flu-dyn"
Hybrid deep learning and physics-based neural network for programmable   illumination computational microscopy,"Ruiqing Sun, Delong Yang, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao","Relying on either deep models or physical models are two mainstream approaches for solving inverse sample reconstruction problems in programmable illumination computational microscopy. Solutions based on physical models possess strong generalization capabilities while struggling with global optimization of inverse problems due to a lack of insufficient physical constraints. In contrast, deep learning methods have strong problem-solving abilities, but their generalization ability is often questioned because of the unclear physical principles. Besides, conventional deep models are difficult to apply to some specific scenes because of the difficulty in acquiring high-quality training data and their limited capacity to generalize across different scenarios. In this paper, to combine the advantages of deep models and physical models together, we propose a hybrid framework consisting of three sub-neural networks (two deep learning networks and one physics-based network). We first obtain a result with rich semantic information through a light deep learning neural network and then use it as the initial value of the physical network to make its output comply with physical process constraints. These two results are then used as the input of a fusion deep learning neural work which utilizes the paired features between the reconstruction results of two different models to further enhance imaging quality. The final result integrates the advantages of both deep models and physical models and can quickly solve the computational reconstruction inverse problem in programmable illumination computational microscopy and achieve better results.

Physics-based models usually struggle with high computational demands and closed-system assumptions, while data-driven models may overlook essential physical dynamics, confusing the capturing of spatiotemporal correlations. Although some physics-informed approaches combine the strengths of both models, they often face a mismatch between explicit physical equations and implicit learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose Air-DualODE, a novel physics-informed approach that integrates dual branches of Neural ODEs for air quality prediction. The first branch applies open-system physical equations to capture spatiotemporal dependencies for learning physics dynamics, while the second branch identifies the dependencies not addressed by the first in a fully data-driven way.

Coarse-Grained Structure of a Physical (Strange) Attractor. Analytical   Solution,Maria K. Koleva,"The structure of the physical and strange attractors is inherently associated with the boundedness of fluctuations. The idea behind the boundedness is that a stable long-term evolution of any natural and engineered system is possible if and only if the fluctuations that the system exerts are bounded so that the system permanently stays within its thresholds of stability. It has been established that the asymptotic structure of the physical and strange attractors is identical. Now it is found out that though the non-asymptotic behavior is universal it can be very different, namely: on coarse-graining the physical attractors can exhibit a variety of behavior while the strange attractors always have hyperuniversal properties. Yet, under certain levels of coarse-graining both physical and strange attractors match non-asymptotically a variety of noise type behavior.",2003-09-01T08:21:39Z,2003-09-01T08:21:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0309026v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0309026v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP, nlin.CD"
A Combinatorial Approach to Diffeomorphism Invariant Quantum Gauge   Theories,Jose A. Zapata,"Quantum gauge theory in the connection representation uses functions of holonomies as configuration observables. Physical observables (gauge and diffeomorphism invariant) are represented in the Hilbert space of physical states; physical states are gauge and diffeomorphism invariant distributions on the space of functions of the holonomies of the edges of a certain family of graphs. Then a family of graphs embedded in the space manifold (satisfying certain properties) induces a representation of the algebra of physical observables. We construct a quantum model from the set of piecewise linear graphs on a piecewise linear manifold, and another manifestly combinatorial model from graphs defined on a sequence of increasingly refined simplicial complexes. Even though the two models are different at the kinematical level, they provide unitarily equivalent representations of the algebra of physical observables in separable Hilbert spaces of physical states (their s-knot basis is countable). Hence, the combinatorial framework is compatible with the usual interpretation of quantum field theory.",1997-03-14T21:44:32Z,1997-03-14T21:44:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9703037v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9703037v1,"gr-qc, hep-lat, hep-th"

Critical Issues in Linear Colliders,Valery Telnov,"Linear colliders (LC) on the energy 0.5-1 TeV are considered as the next step in the particle physics. High acceleration gradients, small beam sizes, precision tolerances, beam collision effects are main problems for linear colliders. In this paper we discuss physics motivation, parameters and status of current LC projects, e+e-, gamma-gamma and gamma-electron modes of operation, physical limitations on the energy and luminosity. Present technologies allow to reach energies about 5 TeV with adequate luminosities. Advanced technique based on plasma and laser method of acceleration can provide much higher accelerating gradients, however, perspectives of these methods for high energy colliders are still under big question. Linear colliders with energies above 10 TeV are hard for any acceleration technology. Speculations on possibility of PeV linear colliders based on ponderomotive laser acceleration are just not serious and contain several mistakes on conceptual level. It is shown that due to radiation in the transverse laser field, methods of acceleration based on laser bunch ``pressure'' do not work at high energies.",2003-06-20T17:30:15Z,2003-06-20T17:30:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0306044v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0306044v1,"hep-ex, physics.acc-ph, physics.optics"

Phase Transitions in the Universe,Marcelo Gleiser,"During the past two decades, cosmologists turned to particle physics in order to explore the physics of the very early Universe. The main link between the physics of the smallest and largest structures in the Universe is the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking, familiar from condensed matter physics. Implementing this mechanism into cosmology leads to the interesting possibility that phase transitions related to the breaking of symmetries in high energy particle physics took place during the early history of the Universe. These cosmological phase transitions may help us understand many of the challenges faced by the standard hot Big Bang model of cosmology, while offering a unique window into the very early Universe and the physics of high energy particle interactions.",1998-03-09T23:21:43Z,1998-03-09T23:21:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9803291v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9803291v1,"hep-ph, astro-ph, cond-mat"

New Physics and the Landau Pole,Michael S. Chanowitz,"In scalar field theories the Landau pole is an ultraviolet singularity in the running coupling constant that indicates a mass scale at which the theory breaks down and new physics must intervene. However, new physics at the pole will in general affect the running of the low energy coupling constant, which will in turn affect the location of the pole and the related upper limit (``triviality'' bound) on the low energy coupling constant. If the new physics is strongly coupled to the scalar fields these effects can be significant even though they are power suppressed. We explore the possible range of such effects by deriving the one loop renormalization group equations for an effective scalar field theory with a dimension 6 operator representing the low energy effects of the new physics. As an independent check we also consider a renormalizable model of the high-scale physics constructed so that its low energy limit coincides with the effective theory.",2000-10-26T19:47:36Z,2000-10-26T19:47:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0010310v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0010310v1,"hep-ph, hep-lat"

Selected applications of theoretical methods in QCD used in the interpretation of data are given and some of the issues restricting theoretical precision on the CKM matrix elements discussed. The overall consistency of the CKM theory with the available data in flavour physics is impressive and we quantify this consistency. Current data also show some anomalies which, however, are not yet statistically significant. They are discussed briefly. Some benchmark measurements that remain to be done in experiments at the $B$-factories and hadron colliders are listed.

Yost","We present new results for two important heavy vector boson physics processes: (1), virtual corrections to hard bremsstrahlung which are relevant to precision predictions for the radiative return process in Z boson production at and beyond LEP2 energies ; and, (2), electric charge screening effects in single W production with finite p_T, multiple photon radiation in high energy collider physics processes. In both cases we show that we improve the respective precision tag significantly. Phenomenological implications are discussed.",2004-11-03T16:00:39Z,2004-11-03T16:00:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0411051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0411051v1,hep-ph

"The B -> pi pi, pi K Puzzles: Implications for Hadron Physics, New   Physics and Rare Decays",Robert Fleischer,"The B-meson system is an interesting probe for the exploration of strong interactions, the quark-flavour sector of the Standard Model, and the search for new physics. In this programme, non-leptonic B decays, which are particularly challenging from the point of view of QCD, play a key role. After discussing strategies to deal with the corresponding hadronic matrix elements of four-quark operators and popular avenues for new physics to manifest itself in B decays, we focus on puzzling patterns in the B-factory data for B -> pi pi, pi K decays; we explore their implications for hadron physics, new physics and rare K and B decays.",2005-07-13T14:26:42Z,2005-07-13T14:26:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0507156v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0507156v1,hep-ph
Physics aspects of polarized e+ at the linear collider,Gudrid Moortgat-Pick,"Polarized e- and e+ at the International Linear Collider play an important role for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model and for precisely unravelling the structure of the underlying physics. The physics programme at the first energy stage at sqrt{s}=500 GeV benefits strongly from the polarization of both beams. But also at 1 TeV as well as at a possible multi-TeV design of a linear collider, CLIC, the physics output is greatly enriched by beam polarization. An overview is given of the impact of providing polarized e+ at the linear collider in addition to polarized e- for physics studies in top, Higgs, supersymmetry and further models of physics beyond the Standard Model.",2006-07-14T16:13:36Z,2006-07-14T16:13:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0607173v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0607173v1,hep-ph

Finite Approximations to Quantum Physics: Quantum Points and their   Bundles,"A. P. Balachandran, G. Bimonte, E. Ercolessi, P. Teotonio-Sobrinho","There exists a physically well motivated method for approximating manifolds by certain topological spaces with a finite or a countable set of points. These spaces, which are partially ordered sets (posets) have the power to effectively reproduce important topological features of continuum physics like winding numbers and fractional statistics, and that too often with just a few points. In this work, we develop the essential tools for doing quantum physics on posets. The poset approach to covering space quantization, soliton physics, gauge theories and the Dirac equation are discussed with emphasis on physically important topological aspects. These ideas are illustrated by simple examples like the covering space quantization of a particle on a circle, and the sine-Gordon solitons.",1993-10-04T14:53:00Z,1993-10-04T14:53:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9310015v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9310015v1,"hep-th, gr-qc, hep-lat"

The Pivotal Role of Causality in Local Quantum Physics,Bert Schroer,"In this article an attempt is made to present very recent conceptual and computational developments in QFT as new manifestations of old and well establihed physical principles. The vehicle for converting the quantum-algebraic aspects of local quantum physics into more classical geometric structures is the modular theory of Tomita. As the above named laureate to whom I have dedicated has shown together with his collaborator for the first time in sufficient generality, its use in physics goes through Einstein causality. This line of research recently gained momentum when it was realized that it is not only of structural and conceptual innovative power (see section 4), but also promises to be a new computational road into nonperturbative QFT (section 5) which, picturesquely speaking, enters the subject on the extreme opposite (noncommutative) side.",1998-09-02T15:48:21Z,1999-04-15T19:11:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9809017v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9809017v4,"hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"

Geometry of the physical phase space in quantum gauge models,Sergei V. Shabanov,The physical phase space in gauge systems is studied. Effects caused by a non-Euclidean geometry of the physical phase space in quantum gauge models are described in the operator and path integral formalisms. The projection on the Dirac gauge invariant states is used to derive a necessary modification of the Hamiltonian path integral in gauge theories of the Yang-Mills type with fermions that takes into account the non-Euclidean geometry of the physical phase space. The new path integral is applied to resolve the Gribov obstruction. Applications to the Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theory are given. The basic ideas are illustrated with examples accessible for non-specialists.,2000-02-05T21:47:40Z,2000-02-05T21:47:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0002043v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0002043v1,"hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"

Quantum Anomaly in Molecular Physics,"Horacio E Camblong, Luis N. Epele, Huner Fanchiotti, Carlos A. Garcia Canal","The interaction of an electron with a polar molecule is shown to be the simplest realization of a quantum anomaly in a physical system. The existence of a critical dipole moment for electron capture and formation of anions, which has been confirmed experimentally and numerically, is derived. This phenomenon is a manifestation of the anomaly associated with quantum symmetry breaking of the classical scale invariance exhibited by the point-dipole interaction. Finally, analysis of symmetry breaking for this system is implemented within two different models: point dipole subject to an anomaly and finite dipole subject to explicit symmetry breaking.",2001-06-16T00:11:47Z,2001-11-12T03:56:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0106144v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0106144v2,"hep-th, hep-ph, math-ph, math.MP, physics.atom-ph, quant-ph"

Effective Field Theories and Inflation,"C. P. Burgess, J. Cline, R. Holman","We investigate the possible influence of very-high-energy physics on inflationary predictions focussing on whether effective field theories can allow effects which are parametrically larger than order H^2/M^2, where M is the scale of heavy physics and H is the Hubble scale at horizon exit. By investigating supersymmetric hybrid inflation models, we show that decoupling does not preclude heavy-physics having effects for the CMB with observable size even if H^2/M^2 << O(1%), although their presence can only be inferred from observations given some a priori assumptions about the inflationary mechanism. Our analysis differs from the results of hep-th/0210233, in which other kinds of heavy-physics effects were found which could alter inflationary predictions for CMB fluctuations, inasmuch as the heavy-physics can be integrated out here to produce an effective field theory description of low-energy physics. We argue, as in hep-th/0210233, that the potential presence of heavy-physics effects in the CMB does not alter the predictions of inflation for generic models, but does make the search for deviations from standard predictions worthwhile.",2003-06-10T02:45:51Z,2003-06-10T02:45:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0306079v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0306079v1,hep-th
Nature of Time and particles-caustics: physical World in algebrodynamics   and in twistor theory,Vladimir V. Kassandrov,"In the field theories with twistor structure particles can be identified with (spacially bounded) caustics of null geodesic congruences defined by the twistor field. As a realization, we consider the ``algebrodynamical'' approach based on the field equations which originate from noncommutative analysis (over the algebra of biquaternions) and lead to the complex eikonal field and to the set of gauge fields associated with solutions of the eikonal equation. Particle-like formations represented by singularities of these fields possess ``elementary'' electric charge and other realistic ``quantum numbers'' and manifest self-consistent time evolution including transmutations. Related concepts of generating ``World Function'' and of multivalued physical fields are discussed. The picture of Lorentz invariant light-formed aether and of matter born from light arises then quite naturally. The notion of the Time Flow identified with the flow of primodial light (``pre-Light'') is introduced in the context.

"Simultaneous Ordinary and Type A N-fold Supersymmetries in Schroedinger,   Pauli, and Dirac Equations","Choon-Lin Ho, Toshiaki Tanaka","We investigate physical models which possess simultaneous ordinary and type A N-fold supersymmetries, which we call type A (N,1)-fold supersymmetry. Inequivalent type A (N,1)-fold supersymmetric models with real-valued potentials are completely classified. Among them, we find that a trigonometric Rosen-Morse type and its elliptic version are of physical interest. We investigate various aspects of these models, namely, dynamical breaking and interrelation between ordinary and N-fold supersymmetries, shape invariance, quasi-solvability, and an associated algebra which is composed of one bosonic and four fermionic operators and dubbed type A (N,1)-fold superalgebra. As realistic physical applications, we demonstrate how these systems can be embedded into Pauli and Dirac equations in external electromagnetic fields.",2005-09-02T05:56:12Z,2006-01-23T13:30:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509020v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0509020v2,"hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"

Mathematical Basis for Physical Inference,"Albert Tarantola, Klaus Mosegaard","While the axiomatic introduction of a probability distribution over a space is common, its use for making predictions, using physical theories and prior knowledge, suffers from a lack of formalization. We propose to introduce, in the space of all probability distributions, two operations, the OR and the AND operation, that bring to the space the necessary structure for making inferences on possible values of physical parameters. While physical theories are often asumed to be analytical, we argue that consistent inference needs to replace analytical theories by probability distributions over the parameter space, and we propose a systematic way of obtaining such ""theoretical correlations"", using the OR operation on the results of physical experiments. Predicting the outcome of an experiment or solving ""inverse problems"" are then examples of the use of the AND operation. This leads to a simple and complete mathematical basis for general physical inference.",2000-09-20T00:59:30Z,2000-09-20T00:59:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0009029v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0009029v1,"math-ph, math.MP"
Symmetries Shared by Particle Physics and Quantum Optics,Y. S. Kim,"It is known that two coupled harmonic oscillators can support the symmetry group as rich as O(3,3) which corresponds to the Lorentz group applicable to three space-like and three time-like coordinates. This group contains many subgroups, including O(3), O(3,2), O(2,1) which are already familiar to us. In this report, we discuss the symmetry of O(1,1) which plays pivotal roles in quantum optics and particle physics. For this one-parameter group, a full-fledged group theory is not necessary, and we can start the discussion from the Hamiltonian of the coupled oscillator system. It is shown first that, from the group theoretical point of view, the squeeze state of light is a representation of this O(1,1) group. It is then shown that the same mathematical device supports three seemingly different ideas of Feynman, namely the parton model, the relativistic quark model for hadrons, and the ``rest of the universe'' in connection with the density matrix. If these three theories are combined, they produce a covariant picture of Feynman's parton model with a built-in decoherence mechanism.",2000-11-14T21:35:47Z,2000-11-14T21:35:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0011024v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0011024v1,"math-ph, hep-ph, hep-th, math.MP, math.SG, quant-ph"

Evolutionary forms: Conservation laws and causality,L. I. Petrova,"Evolutionary forms are skew-symmetric differential forms the basis of which, as opposed to exterior forms, are deforming manifolds (with unclosed metric forms). Such differential forms arise when describing physical processes. A specific feature of evolutionary forms is the fact that from the evolutionary forms, which correspond to the conservation laws for material media, the closed exterior forms, which correspond to the conservation laws for physical fields, are obtained. This shows that material media generate physical fields. And by this the determinacy of physical processes and phenomena is revealed.   In this paper we obtain the mathematic apparatus that allows to describe discrete transitions and quantum jumps. This relates to the fact that the mathematic apparatus of exterior and evolutionary forms, which basis involves nonidentical relations and degenerate transformations, can describe transitions from nonconjugate operators to conjugate ones. None of mathematic formalisms contains such possibilities.   The physical results that disclose a mechanism of evolutionary processes in material media and a generation of physical fields are obtained. These results explain many actual processes.",2005-06-09T09:07:30Z,2005-06-09T09:07:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0506018v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0506018v1,"math-ph, math.MP, LaTeX 2e"
Hierarchy Based Microworld Scales' Classification and Microworld Physics,A. Ya. Temkin,"Scales of the microworld are defined on the grounds of the hierarchy that can be set up within a well ordered finite or infinite countable set of well ordered sets. Indirect measurements in pure mathematical as well as physical meaning are considered as the mean to obtain information on the occurring within each scale. The general concept of the physical laws within a certain scale is defined in the framework of the set theory. The hypothesis is proposed that quarks are not within the same scale as other elementary particles are, but within the following (""smaller"", exactly of lower hierarchy) scale. Maybe, in particular, this is the cause of difficulties of the free quark detection? Some other consequences of the abovementioned hypothesis are discussed.   Limitations of the possibility to obtain information on the going on within sets of low hierarchy (in particular, ""small"" scales of the microworld, in physics) and to transfer it toward the set of the highest hierarchy (in particular, to the macroscopic observer in physics) are found as a consequences of the multi-step character of measurements.

Finite group symmetry breaking,G. Gaeta,"Finite group symmetry is commonplace in Physics, in particular through crystallographic groups occurring in condensed matter physics -- but also through the inversions (C,P,T and their combinations) occurring in high energy physics and field theory.   The breaking of finite groups symmetry has thus been thoroughly studied, and general approaches exist to investigate it.   In Landau theory, the state of a system is described by a finite dimensional variable (the {\it order parameter}), and physical states correspond to minima of a potential, invariant under a group.   In this article we describe the basics of symmetry breaking analysis for systems described by a symmetric polynomial; in particular we discuss generic symmetry breakings, i.e. those determined by the symmetry properties themselves and independent on the details of the polynomial describing a concrete system. We also discuss how the plethora of invariant polynomials can be to some extent reduced by means of changes of coordinates, i.e. how one can reduce to consider certain types of polynomials with no loss of generality. Finally, we will give some indications on extension of this theory, i.e. on how one deals with symmetry breakings for more general groups and/or more general physical systems.",2005-10-02T19:55:25Z,2005-10-02T19:55:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0510010v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0510010v1,"math-ph, math.MP"
Role of exterior and evolutionary skew-symmetric differential forms in   mathematical physics,L. I. Petrova,"A role of skew-symmetric differential forms in mathematical physics relates to the fact that they reflect the properties of conservation laws. The closed exterior forms correspond to the conservation laws for physical fields, whereas the evolutionary forms correspond to the conservation laws for material media.   Skew-symmetric differential forms can describe a conjugacy of any objects (that correspond to the conservation laws). The closed exterior forms describe conjugated objects. And the evolutionary forms, whose basis are deforming manifolds, describe the process of conjugating objects and obtaining conjugated objects. From the evolutionary forms the closed exterior forms are obtained.   This shows that material media generate physical fields. The relation between evolutionary and closed exterior forms discloses the relation between the equations of mathematical physics and field theories. This explains the field theory postulates.   Conjugacy is possible if there is symmetry. Symmetries of closed exterior forms, which are conditions of fulfilment of the conservation laws for physical fields, are interior symmetries of field theories. And symmetries of dual forms (due to the degrees of freedom of material media) are external symmetries of the equations of field theories. This shows connection between internal and external symmetries of field theories.",2005-10-21T15:31:39Z,2005-10-21T15:31:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0510077v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0510077v1,"math-ph, math.MP, LaTex 2e"

Graph kinematics of discrete physical objects: beyond space-time. I.   General,V. E. Asribekov,The necessity of an introduction of discrete physical objects in physics conception is analysed taking into consideration an optimum stage for postulating of some like objects in microworld as well as in macroworld including the new ``physical graph'' as a discrete microobject and carrying out its analogy with ``Kirchhoff's laws graph'' for an electric network as a prototype of discrete macroobject which correspond both to discrete sets of trees -- root trees (for microobjects) or skeleton trees (for macro networks). The transitions are found connecting the usual $S$-matrix theory with Feynman integrals and Feynman diagrams and the new physical graph kinematics formalism which uses the natural root trees basis for the treatment of the structure of an arbitrary complicated physical microobject with a specific ``graph microgeometry'' -- beyond space-time consideration. Accordingly to the QCD results the proton (nucleon) mass is determined in terms of the root trees number $T_{v=3D11}$=3D1842 which corresponds to v=3D11 physical graph vertices. It is supposed that by means of a double- and a triple-splitting of the root trees numbers could be estimated the masses of the various series of another microobjects.,2001-10-08T12:52:24Z,2001-10-08T12:52:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0110024v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0110024v1,physics.gen-ph

Large forward-backward asymmetry in B --> K mu+ mu- from new physics   tensor operators,"Ashutosh Kumar Alok, Amol Dighe, S.

New physics in the form of vector/axial-vector operators does not contribute to A_{FB}(q^2) whereas new physics in the form of scalar/pseudoscalar operators can enhance A_{FB}(q^2) only by a few per cent. However new physics the form of tensor operators can take the peak value of A_{FB}(q^2) to as high as 40% near the high-q^2 end point. In addition, if both scalar/pseudoscalar and tensor operators are present, then A_{FB}(q^2) can be more than 15% for the entire high-q^2 region q^2 > 15 GeV^2. The observation of significant A_{FB} would imply the presence of new physics tensor operators, whereas its q^2 dependence could further indicate the presence of new scalar/pseudoscalar physics.",2008-10-21T09:18:00Z,2008-10-21T09:18:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3779v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3779v1,hep-ph

Configurations are generated with the O(a)-improved Wilson quark action and the Iwasaki gauge action. The up-down quark is simulated by employing the DDHMC algorithm with several improvements and the UV-filtered PHMC algorithm is implemented for the strange quark. We investigate the convergence behaviors of the SU(2) and SU(3) chiral expansions up to NLO for the pseudoscalar meson sector, where the up-down quark mass ranges from 3 MeV to 24 MeV and the strange quark mass is chosen around the physical value. The fit results for the low energy constants are compared with those recently obtained by other groups. We also discuss the importance of the direct simulation at the physical point by comparing the physical quantities measured on the physical point with those estimated by the extrapolation method.",2008-11-17T06:44:09Z,2008-11-17T06:44:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2630v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2630v1,hep-lat

Effectiveness of Ninth-Grade Physics in Maine: Conceptual Understanding,"Michael O'Brien, John Thompson","The Physics First movement - teaching a true physics course to ninth grade students - is gaining popularity in high schools. There are several different rhetorical arguments for and against this movement, and it is quite controversial in physics education. However, there is no actual evidence to assess the success, or failure, of this substantial shift in the science teaching sequence. We have undertaken a comparison study of physics classes taught in ninth- and 12th grade classes in Maine. Comparisons of student understanding and gains with respect to mechanics concepts were made with excerpts from well-known multiple-choice surveys and individual student interviews. Results indicate that both populations begin physics courses with similar content knowledge and specific difficulties, but that in the learning of the concepts ninth graders are more sensitive to the instructional method used.",2009-01-29T14:51:13Z,2009-01-29T14:51:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4692v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.4692v1,physics.ed-ph

"Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone","John C. Baez, Mike Stay","In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a ""cobordism"". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation.

Physical Consequences of Complex Dimensions of Fractals,"Eric Akkermans, Gerald V.

We identify the physical origin of these complex poles as the exponentially large degeneracy of the iterated eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and discuss applications in quantum mesoscopic systems such as oscillations in the fluctuation $\Sigma^2 (E)$ of the number of levels, as a correction to results obtained in Random Matrix Theory.

Non-physical consequences of the Muffin-tin-type intra-molecular   potential,"M. Ya. Amusia, A. S.

The magnitude of non-physical effects is of the same order as the physical oscillations in the cross-section of a two-atomic molecule. The role of the size of these jumps is illustrated by choosing three values of it. The results obtained are connected to the studied previously effect of non-analytical behavior as a function of r the potential V(r)acting upon a particle on its photoionization cross-section. In reality, such potential has to be analytic in magnitude and first derivative function in distance. Introduction of non-analytic features in model potential leads to non-physical features in the corresponding cross-section - oscillations, additional maxima etc.",2009-05-11T19:57:26Z,2009-05-11T19:57:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1529v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.1529v1,"physics.chem-ph, physics.atom-ph"

In this contribution we show that these relations are even more general than originally assumed as their validity is conditioned by the smoothness of the underlying nuclear mass function and nothing else. Based on the assumed smoothness of the underlying physical function, the main conclusions from this study are: (1) the GK relations are model independent; (2) any slowly-varying physical observable satisfies the GK relations; and (3) the accuracy of the GK relations may be systematically improved. Examples from nuclear physics (charge radii) and from particle physics (baryon masses) are used to illustrate the flexibility of the approach.",2009-05-13T14:52:40Z,2009-05-15T16:59:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2129v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.2129v2,"nucl-th, hep-ex, hep-ph, nucl-ex"

A Categorical Framework for Quantum Theory,"Thomas Filk, Albrecht von Mueller","Underlying any theory of physics is a layer of conceptual frames. They connect the mathematical structures used in theoretical models with physical phenomena, but they also constitute our fundamental assumptions about reality. Many of the discrepancies between quantum physics and classical physics (including Maxwell's electrodynamics and relativity) can be traced back to these categorical foundations. We argue that classical physics corresponds to the factual aspects of reality and requires a categorical framework which consists of four interdependent components: boolean logic, the linear-sequential notion of time, the principle of sufficient reason, and the dichotomy between observer and observed. None of these can be dropped without affecting the others. However, in quantum theory the reduction postulate also addresses the ""status nascendi"" of facts, i.e., their coming into being. Therefore, quantum phyics requires a different conceptual framework which will be elaborated in this article. It is shown that many of its components are already present in the standard formalisms of quantum physics, but in most cases they are highlighted not so much from a conceptual perspective but more from their mathematical structures. The categorical frame underlying quantum physics includes a profoundly different notion of time which encompasses a crucial role for the present.",2009-07-30T14:32:33Z,2009-07-30T14:32:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.5242v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5242v1,quant-ph

Discovering the Higgs Boson in New Physics Events using Jet Substructure,"Graham D. Kribs, Adam Martin, Tuhin S. Roy, Michael Spannowsky","We present a novel method to discover the Higgs boson in new physics event samples at the LHC. Our technique applies to broad classes of models where the Higgs has a significant branching fraction to b-bbar. We exploit the recently developed techniques for discovering a boosted Higgs using jet substructure. Our requirements of new physics are quite general: there must be features in the new physics event sample that allow a clean separation from standard model background, and there should be Higgs bosons produced in association with the new physics. We demonstrate that this method superbly finds and identifies the lightest Higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We focus on two case studies with a gravitino LSP, however, generalizations to other LSPs and to other models of new physics are also briefly discussed. In some circumstances, discovery of the lightest Higgs is possible well before conventional search strategies uncover convincing evidence.",2009-12-23T21:00:10Z,2009-12-23T21:00:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4731v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.4731v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex"

Her immediate goal though, is to tackle the obstacles on the way up, and reach the summit. In a similar vein, one of the immediate goals of contemporary theoretical physics is to build a quantum, unified description of general relativity and the standard model of particle physics. Once that peak has been reached, a new (yet unknown) vista will open up. In this essay I propose a novel approach towards this goal.

"A New Principle in Physics: the Principle of ""Finiteness"", and Some   Consequences",Abraham Sternlieb,"In this paper I propose a new principle in physics: the principle of ""finiteness"". It stems from the definition of physics as a science that deals (among other things) with measurable dimensional physical quantities. Since measurement results, including their errors, are always finite, the principle of finiteness postulates that the mathematical formulation of ""legitimate"" laws of physics should prevent exactly zero or infinite solutions. Some consequences of the principle of finiteness are discussed, in general, and then more specifically in the fields of special relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum gravity. The consequences are derived independently of any other theory or principle in physics. I propose ""finiteness"" as a postulate (like the constancy of the speed of light in vacuum, ""c""), as opposed to a notion whose validity has to be corroborated by, or derived theoretically or experimentally from other facts, theories, or principles.",2010-06-18T14:14:20Z,2010-06-18T14:14:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3697v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.3697v1,physics.gen-ph

In this paper, in order to prevent musculoskeletal disorders, the integration of virtual human simulation and VR application is presented to facilitate physical ergonomic evaluation, especially for physical fatigue evaluation of a given population. Immersive working environments are created to avoid expensive physical mock-up in conventional evaluation methods. Peripheral motion capture systems are used to capture natural movements and then to simulate the physical operations in virtual human simulation. Physical aspects of human's movement are then analyzed to determine the effort level of each key joint using inverse kinematics. The physical fatigue level of each joint is further analyzed by integrating a fatigue and recovery model on the basis of physical task parameters. All the process has been realized based on VRHIT platform and a case study is presented to demonstrate the function of the physical fatigue for a given population and its usefulness for worker selection.",2010-12-10T08:09:20Z,2010-12-10T08:09:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2197v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2197v1,cs.RO
A physicist's view of the universe: a philosophical approach,Israel Perez,"Without a doubt many problems in physics arise as a consequence of our philosophical conception of the world. In this contribution however we endeavor to alleviate this scenario by putting forward a philosophical approach under which some of the most fundamental problems in modern physics might turn out to be fictitious. To accomplish such task we propound that everything that exists must be made up of \emph{matter} which not only makes up space and the universe but also is in constant change. For such reason the existence of total emptiness and material discontinuity are rejected. Here physical fields are assumed as a particular state of matter. And time is understood as the result of the intrinsic dynamics of the universe. Furthermore, the infiniteness of the universe is also discussed and its implications are briefly mentioned, e.g., the laws of conservation. Finally, the regularity of the physical laws is questioned. In summary four great problems (from the perspective of physics) are suggested to be deeply studied: (1) What is matter?, (2) Why does the universe change? (3) is the universe infinite in extension? and (4) are there really regular (invariant) laws of physics?",2010-12-11T02:35:20Z,2010-12-11T02:35:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2423v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2423v1,"physics.gen-ph, physics.hist-ph"

Tau lepton charge asymmetry and new physics at the LHC,"Sudhir Kumar Gupta, German Valencia",We consider the possibility of studying new physics that singles out the tau-lepton at the LHC. We concentrate on the tau-lepton charge asymmetry in tau+tau- pair production as a tool to probe this physics beyond the Standard Model. We consider two generic scenarios for the new physics. We first study a non-universal Z' boson as an example of a new resonance that can single out tau-leptons. We then consider vector lepto-quarks coupling of the first generation quarks with the third generation leptons as an example of non-resonant new physics. We find that in both cases the charge asymmetry can be sufficiently sensitive to the new physics to provide useful constraints at the LHC.,2011-02-03T17:49:24Z,2011-07-11T16:35:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0741v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.0741v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex"

Yet several works have shown how quantum theory as it stands could breach the physical Church-Turing thesis. We draw a clear line as to when this is the case, in a way that is inspired by Gandy. Gandy formulates postulates about physics, such as homogeneity of space and time, bounded density and velocity of information --- and proves that the physical Church-Turing thesis is a consequence of these postulates.

Interference Effects in Schwinger Vacuum Pair Production for   Time-Dependent Laser Pulses,"Cesim K. Dumlu, Gerald V. Dunne","We present simple new approximate formulas, for both scalar and spinor QED, for the number of particles produced from vacuum by a time dependent electric field, incorporating the interference effects that arise from an arbitrary number of distinct semiclassical turning points. Such interference effects are important when the temporal profile of the laser pulse has subcycle structure. We show how the resulting semiclassical intuition may be used to guide the design of temporal profiles that enhance the momentum spectrum due to interference effects. The result is easy to implement and generally applicable to time-dependent tunneling problems, such as appear in many other contexts in particle and nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, atomic physics, chemical physics, and gravitational physics.",2011-02-14T21:15:06Z,2011-02-21T12:44:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2899v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.2899v2,"hep-th, hep-ph, quant-ph"
On the experimental determination of the one-way speed of light,Israel Perez,"In this contribution the question of the isotropy of the one-way speed of light from an experimental perspective is addressed. In particular, we analyze two experimental methods commonly used in its determination. The analysis is aimed at clarifying the view that the one-way speed of light cannot be determined by techniques in which physical entities close paths. The procedure employed here will provide epistemological tools such that physicists understand that a direct measurement of the speed not only of light but of any physical entity is by no means trivial. Our results shed light on the physics behind the experiments which may be of interest for both physicists with an elemental knowledge in special relativity and philosophers of science.",2011-02-22T05:54:36Z,2011-04-22T01:59:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4837v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.4837v2,"physics.class-ph, physics.gen-ph, physics.hist-ph"

Computations in Finite Groups and Quantum Physics,Vladimir V. Kornyak,"Mathematical core of quantum mechanics is the theory of unitary representations of symmetries of physical systems. We argue that quantum behavior is a natural result of extraction of ""observable"" information about systems containing ""unobservable"" elements in their descriptions. Since our aim is physics where the choice between finite and infinite descriptions can not have any empirical consequences, we consider the problem in the finite background. Besides, there are many indications from observations - from the lepton mixing data, for example - that finite groups underly phenomena in particle physics at the deep level. The ""finite"" approach allows to reduce any quantum dynamics to the simple permutation dynamics, and thus to express quantum observables in terms of permutation invariants of symmetry groups and their integer characteristics such as sizes of conjugate classes, sizes of group orbits, class coefficients, dimensions of representations. Our study has been accompanied by computations with finite groups, their representations and invariants.

We then apply these ideas to examine an introductory biology course that incorporates physics and mathematics. We characterize the uses of interdisciplinary tools in this biology course and contrast them with the typical uses of these tools in physics courses. Finally, we examine student responses to the use of mathematics and physics in this course, to better understand the challenges and consequences of using interdisciplinary tools in introductory courses.

Generalized Minkowski spacetime with geometric algebra,"James M. Chappell, David L.

We propose that this is the correct algebraic representation for physical three-dimensional space. We find that this representation incorporates spin and helicity directly into spacetime, in a Lorentz invariant manner. From this foundation, based on purely algebraic arguments, we derive Minkowski spacetime, the properties of electromagnetic radiation and Maxwell's equations. These results being achieved all without physical arguments, showing that these physical laws are actually purely geometric effects. This approach also leads to a generalization of complex mass and proper time. Several insight about time are produced, including an arrow of time, which ultimately becomes a five-dimensional property. We also provide a new argument explaining the non-existence of magnetic monopoles. We suggest that the rotational freedoms, inherent in three-dimensional physical space are an important aspect of nature, not properly addressed in physics, as they are not incorporated within the spacetime background, as achieved in this paper.",2012-05-23T14:58:18Z,2024-09-28T02:48:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5195v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.5195v3,"math-ph, math.MP, physics.class-ph, 83-XX"
Schroedinger equation and classical physics,Milos V. Lokajicek,"Any time-dependent solution of Schr\""{o}dinger equation may be always correlated to a solution of Hamilton equations or to a statistical combination of their solutions; only the set of corresponding solutions is somewhat smaller (due to existence of quantization). There is not any reason to the physical interpretation according to Copenhagen alternative as Bell's inequalities are valid in the classical physics only (and not in any alternative based on Schr\""{o}dinger equation). The advantage of Schr\""{o}dinger equation consists then in that it enables to represent directly the time evolution of a statistical distribution of classical initial states (which is usual in collision experiments). The Schr\""{o}dinger equation (without assumptions added by Bohr) may then represent the common physical theory for microscopic as well as macroscopic physical systems. However, together with the last possibility the solutions of Schr\""{o}dinger equation may be helpful also in analyzing the influence of other statistically distributed properties (e.g., spin orientations or space structures) of individual matter objects forming a corresponding physical system, which goes in principle beyond the classical physics. In any case, the contemporary quantum theory represents the phenomenological approximative description of some matter characteristics only, without providing any insight into quantum mechanism emergence. In such a case it is necessary to take into account more detailed properties at least of some involved objects.",2012-05-30T15:15:36Z,2012-05-30T15:15:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6720v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6720v1,quant-ph

Monte Carlo Simulation for Particle Detectors,"Maria Grazia Pia, Georg Weidenspointner","Monte Carlo simulation is an essential component of experimental particle physics in all the phases of its life-cycle: the investigation of the physics reach of detector concepts, the design of facilities and detectors, the development and optimization of data reconstruction software, the data analysis for the production of physics results. This note briefly outlines some research topics related to Monte Carlo simulation, that are relevant to future experimental perspectives in particle physics. The focus is on physics aspects: conceptual progress beyond current particle transport schemes, the incorporation of materials science knowledge relevant to novel detection technologies, functionality to model radiation damage, the capability for multi-scale simulation, quantitative validation and uncertainty quantification to determine the predictive power of simulation. The R&D on simulation for future detectors would profit from cooperation within various components of the particle physics community, and synergy with other experimental domain sharing similar simulation requirements.",2012-07-31T22:39:27Z,2012-07-31T22:39:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0047v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0047v1,"physics.comp-ph, physics.ins-det"
A Potential Foundation for Emergent Space-Time,"Kevin H. Knuth, Newshaw Bahreyni","We present a novel derivation of both the Minkowski metric and Lorentz transformations from the consistent quantification of a causally ordered set of events with respect to an embedded observer. Unlike past derivations, which have relied on assumptions such as the existence of a 4-dimensional manifold, symmetries of space-time, or the constant speed of light, we demonstrate that these now familiar mathematics can be derived as the unique means to consistently quantify a network of events. This suggests that space-time need not be physical, but instead the mathematics of space and time emerges as the unique way in which an observer can consistently quantify events and their relationships to one another. The result is a potential foundation for emergent space-time.",2012-09-05T07:53:25Z,2014-12-19T04:23:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0881v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.0881v3,"math-ph, gr-qc, hep-th, math.MP, quant-ph, 83A05 (Primary), 83C99, 06A99 (Secondary)"

Physical unitarity for a massive Yang-Mills theory without the Higgs   field: (I) A perturbative treatment,"Kei-Ichi Kondo, Kenta Suzuki, Hitoshi Fukamachi, Shogo Nishino, Toru Shinohara","In a series of papers, we examine the physical unitarity in a massive Yang-Mills theory without the Higgs field in which the color gauge symmetry is not spontaneously broken and kept intact. For this purpose, we use a new framework proposed in the previous paper Kondo [arXiv:1208.3521] based on a nonperturbative construction of a non-Abelian field describing a massive spin-one vector boson field, which enables us to perform the perturbative and nonperturbative studies on the physical unitarity. In this paper, we present a new perturbative treatment for the physical unitarity after giving the general properties of the massive Yang-Mills theory. Then we reproduce the violation of physical unitarity in a transparent way.

The Beauty of Lattice Perturbation Theory: The Role of Lattice   Perturbation Theory in B Physics,Christopher Monahan,As new experimental data arrive from the LHC the prospect of indirectly detecting new physics through precision tests of the Standard Model grows more exciting. Precise experimental and theoretical inputs are required to test the unitarity of the CKM matrix and to search for new physics effects in rare decays. Lattice QCD calculations of nonperturbative inputs have reached a precision at the level of a few percent; in many cases aided by the use of lattice perturbation theory. This review examines the role of lattice perturbation theory in B physics calculations on the lattice in the context of two questions: how is lattice perturbation theory used in the different heavy quark formalisms implemented by the major lattice collaborations? And what role does lattice perturbation theory play in determinations of nonperturbative contributions to the physical processes at the heart of the search for new physics? Framing and addressing these questions reveals that lattice perturbation theory is a tool with a spectrum of applications in lattice B physics.,2012-10-26T22:45:15Z,2013-07-10T17:38:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7266v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.7266v3,hep-lat
Constructor Theory,David Deutsch,Constructor theory seeks to express all fundamental scientific theories in terms of a dichotomy between possible and impossible physical transformations - those that can be caused to happen and those that cannot. This is a departure from the prevailing conception of fundamental physics which is to predict what will happen from initial conditions and laws of motion. Several converging motivations for expecting constructor theory to be a fundamental branch of physics are discussed. Some principles of the theory are suggested and its potential for solving various problems and achieving various unifications is explored. These include providing a theory of information underlying classical and quantum information; generalising the theory of computation to include all physical transformations; unifying formal statements of conservation laws with the stronger operational ones (such as the ruling-out of perpetual motion machines); expressing the principles of testability and of the computability of nature (currently deemed methodological and metaphysical respectively) as laws of physics; allowing exact statements of emergent laws (such as the second law of thermodynamics); and expressing certain apparently anthropocentric attributes such as knowledge in physical terms.,2012-10-28T11:09:05Z,2013-01-17T11:46:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7439v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.7439v2,"physics.hist-ph, physics.comp-ph"

They present an introductory, but hopefully coherent, view of the main formalizations of quantum mechanics, of their interrelations and of their common physical underpinnings: causality, reversibility and locality/separability. The approaches covered are mainly: (ii) the canonical formalism; (ii) the algebraic formalism; (iii) the quantum logic formulation. Other subjects: quantum information approaches, quantum correlations, contextuality and non-locality issues, quantum measurements, interpretations and alternate theories, quantum gravity, are only very briefly and superficially discussed. Most of the material is not new, but is presented in an original, homogeneous and hopefully not technical or abstract way. I try to define simply all the mathematical concepts used and to justify them physically.

Here, the physics associated with searches for the violation of lepton-flavor conservation in charged-lepton processes and the violation of lepton-number conservation in nuclear physics processes is summarized. In the first part, several aspects of charged-lepton flavor violation are discussed, especially its sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics. The discussion concentrates mostly on rare processes involving muons and electrons. In the second part, the status of the conservation of total lepton number is discussed.

Evolution of quasi-history in a Physics Textbook,J. R.

A secondary aim is to allow the students to appreciate the scientific approach and significance of it in the evolution of science and society. One approach for the second aim has been to include 'historical material' in physics textbooks. The quantity of the historical material included is quite diverse, from textbooks with a very strong historical approach to others without any historical material. The quality of the material included is also diverse. In this article we focus on the development of the historical material, i.e. a certain historical development, in a specific textbook (Sears & Zemansky's University Physics) over a number of editions. The aim is to see when and how the historical material is included and how well it describes the actual history. Will the physics adapt to history or vice-verse.

The only first-principles method for calculating the nonperturbative, hadronic contributions is lattice QCD.

A strategy consisting of twelve steps which concentrate on theoretically clean observables, to be measured in this decade, could one day allow us to reach the Zeptouniverse.

Aspects of fine-tuning of the Higgs mass within finite field theories,"Pierre Grange', Jean-Francois Mathiot, Bruno Mutet, Ernst Werner","We reanalyze the perturbative radiative corrections to the Higgs mass within the Standard Model in the light of the Taylor-Lagrange renormalization scheme. This scheme naturally leads to completely finite corrections, depending on an arbitrary scale. The formulation avoids very large individual corrections to the Higgs mass. This illustrates the fact that the so-called fine-tuning problem in the Standard Model is just an artifact of the regularization scheme.

Physical observability of horizons,Matt Visser,"Event horizons are (generically) not physically observable.

Consequently event horizons are inappropriate tools for defining astrophysical black holes, or indeed for defining any notion of evolving}black hole, (evolving either due to accretion or Hawking radiation). The only situation in which an event horizon becomes physically observable is for the very highly idealized stationary or static black holes, when the event horizon is a Killing horizon which is degenerate with the apparent and trapping horizons; and then it is the physical observability of the apparent/trapping horizons that is fundamental --- the event horizon merely comes along for the ride.",2014-07-28T00:20:49Z,2014-11-25T20:34:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7295v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7295v3,"gr-qc, hep-th"

Perspectives for Top Quark Physics at the (I)LC,Frank Simon,"Linear e+e- colliders provide a rich set of opportunities for top quark physics, crucial for the understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking and for the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. A ttbar threshold scan in e+e- annihilation enables a precise measurement in theoretically well-defined mass schemes with small experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties. Above the production threshold, the efficient identification of top pair events combined with polarized beams provides the potential to extract the form factors for the top quark couplings with high precision and in a model-independent way, resulting in excellent sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model. This contribution provides an overview of top physics at linear colliders based on results from full-simulation studies of top quark pair production in the detectors proposed for ILC and CLIC. In addition, the influence of the luminosity spectrum of a 100 km circular e+e- collider (FCCee) compared to linear colliders on a top threshold scan is briefly discussed.",2014-11-27T09:54:27Z,2014-11-27T09:54:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7517v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.7517v1,"hep-ex, hep-ph"

Following the discovery of a new, Higgslike boson at the LHC facility in 2012, but with no sign of new physics after having explored a large region of parameter space, a dilemma thus seems to present itself : either the newly discovered boson is indeed the long-sought Higgs boson of the standard model of particle physics (or some appropriate variant of that model) and the new physics at the TeV scale, supposedly required by the naturalness argument, is still waiting to be discovered, possibly by LHC-II, or the identification of the new boson as the Higgs cannot be maintained.

The learned multi-moment fluid PDEs are demonstrated to incorporate kinetic effects such as Landau damping. Based on the learned fluid closure, the data-driven, multi-moment fluid modeling can well reproduce all the physical quantities derived from the fully kinetic model. The calculated damping rate of Landau damping is consistent with both the fully kinetic simulation and the linear theory. The data-driven fluid modeling of PDEs for complex physical systems may be applied to improve fluid closure and reduce the computational cost of multi-scale modeling of global systems.",2022-09-10T19:06:12Z,2022-09-10T19:06:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04726v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04726v1,"physics.plasm-ph, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.space-ph"
Deep Physics Corrector: A physics enhanced deep learning architecture   for solving stochastic differential equations,"Tushar, Souvik Chakraborty","We propose a novel gray-box modeling algorithm for physical systems governed by stochastic differential equations (SDE). The proposed approach, referred to as the Deep Physics Corrector (DPC), blends approximate physics represented in terms of SDE with deep neural network (DNN). The primary idea here is to exploit DNN to model the missing physics. We hypothesize that combining incomplete physics with data will make the model interpretable and allow better generalization. The primary bottleneck associated with training surrogate models for stochastic simulators is often associated with selecting the suitable loss function. Among the different loss functions available in the literature, we use the conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) loss function in DPC because of its proven performance. Overall, physics-data fusion and CMMD allow DPC to learn from sparse data. We illustrate the performance of the proposed DPC on four benchmark examples from the literature. The results obtained are highly accurate, indicating its possible application as a surrogate model for stochastic simulators.",2022-09-20T14:30:07Z,2022-09-20T14:30:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09750v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09750v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG"

Reversing the Arrow of Time,Bryan W Roberts,"The arrow of time refers to the curious asymmetry that distinguishes the future from the past. Reversing the Arrow of Time argues that there is an intimate link between the symmetries of 'time itself' and time reversal symmetry in physical theories, which has wide-ranging implications for both physics and its philosophy. This link helps to clarify how we can learn about the symmetries of our world; how to understand the relationship between symmetries and what is real, and how to overcome pervasive illusions about the direction of time. Roberts explains the significance of time reversal in a way that intertwines physics and philosophy, to establish what the arrow of time means and how we can come to know it.

UV physics from IR features: new prospects from top flavor violation,"Wolfgang Altmannshofer, Stefania Gori, Benjamin V. Lehmann, Jianhong Zuo","New physics in the rare top decays $t \to q \ell^+\ell^-$ is currently very weakly constrained. We show that in a large class of Standard Model extensions, existing experimental constraints on new physics in flavor-conserving processes imply strong indirect bounds on new physics contributions to flavor-violating processes of the form $t \to q \ell^+\ell^-$. These indirect bounds arise from basic principles of quantum field theory together with a few generic conditions on the UV structure of the theory, and are roughly an order of magnitude stronger than the present experimental bounds on the same processes. These constraints provide a theoretically motivated target for experimental searches for $t \to q \ell^+\ell^-$: violation of these bounds would exclude a large class of new physics models, and would provide nontrivial insight into the UV behavior of the new physics.",2023-03-01T19:08:46Z,2023-07-14T01:46:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00781v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00781v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex"
Intrinsic Physical Concepts Discovery with Object-Centric Predictive   Models,"Qu Tang, XiangYu Zhu, Zhen Lei, ZhaoXiang Zhang","The ability to discover abstract physical concepts and understand how they work in the world through observing lies at the core of human intelligence. The acquisition of this ability is based on compositionally perceiving the environment in terms of objects and relations in an unsupervised manner. Recent approaches learn object-centric representations and capture visually observable concepts of objects, e.g., shape, size, and location. In this paper, we take a step forward and try to discover and represent intrinsic physical concepts such as mass and charge. We introduce the PHYsical Concepts Inference NEtwork (PHYCINE), a system that infers physical concepts in different abstract levels without supervision. The key insights underlining PHYCINE are two-fold, commonsense knowledge emerges with prediction, and physical concepts of different abstract levels should be reasoned in a bottom-up fashion. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that variables inferred by our system work in accordance with the properties of the corresponding physical concepts. We also show that object representations containing the discovered physical concepts variables could help achieve better performance in causal reasoning tasks, i.e., ComPhy.",2023-03-03T11:52:21Z,2023-04-09T12:56:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01869v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01869v3,cs.CV
GenPhys: From Physical Processes to Generative Models,"Ziming Liu, Di Luo, Yilun Xu, Tommi Jaakkola, Max Tegmark","Since diffusion models (DM) and the more recent Poisson flow generative models (PFGM) are inspired by physical processes, it is reasonable to ask: Can physical processes offer additional new generative models? We show that the answer is yes. We introduce a general family, Generative Models from Physical Processes (GenPhys), where we translate partial differential equations (PDEs) describing physical processes to generative models. We show that generative models can be constructed from s-generative PDEs (s for smooth). GenPhys subsume the two existing generative models (DM and PFGM) and even give rise to new families of generative models, e.g., ""Yukawa Generative Models"" inspired from weak interactions. On the other hand, some physical processes by default do not belong to the GenPhys family, e.g., the wave equation and the Schr\""{o}dinger equation, but could be made into the GenPhys family with some modifications.

Three-body recombination in physical chemistry,"Marjan Mirahmadi, Jesús Pérez-Ríos","Three-body recombination, or ternary association, is a termolecular reaction in which three particles collide, forming a bound state between two, whereas the third escapes freely. Three-body recombination reactions play a significant role in many systems relevant to physics and chemistry. In particular, they are relevant in cold and ultracold chemistry, quantum gases, astrochemistry, atmospheric physics, physical chemistry, and plasma physics. As a result, three-body recombination has been the subject of extensive work during the last 50 years, although primarily from an experimental perspective. Indeed, a general theory for three-body recombination remains elusive despite the available experimental information. Our group recently developed a direct approach based on classical trajectory calculations in hyperspherical coordinates for three-body recombination to amend this situation, leading to a first principle explanation of ion-atom-atom and atom-atom-atom three-body recombination processes. This review aims to summarize our findings on three-body recombination reactions and identify the remaining challenges in the field.",2023-04-11T15:16:06Z,2023-04-11T15:16:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05272v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05272v1,"physics.chem-ph, physics.atom-ph"

Potentiality realism: A realistic and indeterministic physics based on   propensities,"Flavio Del Santo, Nicolas Gisin","We propose an interpretation of physics named potentiality realism. This view, which can be applied to classical as well as to quantum physics, regards potentialities (i.e. intrinsic, objective propensities for individual events to obtain) as elements of reality, thereby complementing the actual properties taken by physical variables. This allows one to naturally reconcile realism and fundamental indeterminism in any theoretical framework. We discuss our specific interpretation of propensities, that require them to depart from being probabilities at the formal level, though allowing for statistics and the law of large numbers. This view helps reconcile classical and quantum physics by showing that most of the conceptual problems that are customarily taken to be unique issues of the latter -- such as the measurement problem -- are actually in common to all indeterministic physical theories.",2023-05-03T21:01:17Z,2023-11-07T14:58:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02429v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02429v2,"quant-ph, physics.hist-ph"

Physics-Informed Kernel Function Neural Networks for Solving Partial   Differential Equations,"Zhuojia Fu, Wenzhi Xu, Shuainan Liu","This paper proposed a novel radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to solve various partial differential equations (PDEs). In the proposed RBF neural networks, the physics-informed kernel functions (PIKFs), which are derived according to the governing equations of the considered PDEs, are used to be the activation functions instead of the traditional RBFs. Similar to the well-known physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the proposed physics-informed kernel function neural networks (PIKFNNs) also include the physical information of the considered PDEs in the neural network. The difference is that the PINNs put this physical information in the loss function, and the proposed PIKFNNs put the physical information of the considered governing equations in the activation functions. By using the derived physics-informed kernel functions satisfying the considered governing equations of homogeneous, nonhomogeneous, transient PDEs as the activation functions, only the boundary/initial data are required to train the neural network. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed PIKFNNs are validated by several benchmark examples referred to high-wavenumber wave propagation problem, infinite domain problem, nonhomogeneous problem, long-time evolution problem, inverse problem, spatial structural derivative diffusion model, and so on.",2023-06-05T05:36:29Z,2023-06-07T14:36:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02606v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02606v2,"math.NA, cs.NA, 65N35, 65N80, G.1.8"

To address the issue of low accuracy and convergence problems of existing PINNs, we propose a self-training physics-informed neural network, ST-PINN. Specifically, ST-PINN introduces a pseudo label based self-learning algorithm during training. It employs governing equation as the pseudo-labeled evaluation index and selects the highest confidence examples from the sample points to attach the pseudo labels. To our best knowledge, we are the first to incorporate a self-training mechanism into physics-informed learning. We conduct experiments on five PDE problems in different fields and scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed method allows the network to learn more physical information and benefit convergence. The ST-PINN outperforms existing physics-informed neural network methods and improves the accuracy by a factor of 1.33x-2.54x.

Precision studies of quark flavour are one of the most sensitive experimental instruments for this task.

This learning, both in nature and in engineered systems, can occur through evolutionary selection or through dynamical rules that drive active learning from experience. Here, we show that \added{learning in linear physical networks with weak input signals} leaves architectural imprints on the Hessian of a physical system. Compared to a generic organization of the system components, (a) the effective physical dimension of the response to inputs decreases, (b) the response of physical degrees of freedom to random perturbations (or system ``susceptibility'') increases, and (c) the low-eigenvalue eigenvectors of the Hessian align with the task. Overall, these effects embody the typical scenario for learning processes in physical systems in the weak input regime, suggesting ways of discovering whether a physical network may have been trained.",2023-06-22T14:39:03Z,2024-01-27T15:08:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12928v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.12928v2,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech"

Solving differential equations with Deep Learning: a beginner's guide,"Luis Medrano Navarro, Luis Martín Moreno, Sergio G Rodrigo","The research in Artificial Intelligence methods with potential applications in science has become an essential task in the scientific community last years. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is one of this methods and represent a contemporary technique that is based on the fundamentals of neural networks to solve differential equations. These kind of networks have the potential to improve or complement classical numerical methods in computational physics, making them an exciting area of study. In this paper, we introduce PINNs at an elementary level, mainly oriented to physics education so making them suitable for educational purposes at both undergraduate and graduate levels. PINNs can be used to create virtual simulations and educational tools that aid in understating complex physical concepts and processes where differential equations are involved. By combining the power of neural networks with physics principles, PINNs can provide an interactive and engaging learning experience that can improve students' understanding and retention of physics concepts in higher education.",2023-07-20T21:16:01Z,2023-07-20T21:16:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11237v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11237v1,"physics.comp-ph, physics.ed-ph"

Empirical evidence of the inseparability of mathematics and physics in   expert reasoning about novel graphing tasks,"Charlotte Zimmerman, Alexis Olsho, Michael Loverude, Suzanne White Brahmia","Pre-college mathematics modeling instruction often frames mathematics as being separated from reasoning about the real world -- and commonly treats reasoning mathematically and reasoning about the real-world context as separate stages of a modeling cycle. In this paper, we present evidence that helps characterize how experts use mathematics in physics contexts while developing graphical models. An important finding is that there was essentially no evidence of experts reasoning in a context-free way with these tasks, but instead they used physical reasoning -- either grounded in the context of the task or from abstract physical models -- to guide their mathematics. The difference in approach of physics instructors and students may lead to a mismatch in expectations, and frustration, for both parties. This work contributes to the body of knowledge about how mathematical reasoning appears in physics, and can help researchers and instructors recognize the connections to the physical world in expert mathematical reasoning.

Neuroqueer Literacies in a Physics Context: A Discussion on Changing the   Physics Classroom Using a Neuroqueer Literacy Framework,"Liam G. McDermott, Daniel P. Oleynik","Life experience, identity, the relationship between ourselves and the world around us among others, all affect and shape how we, as scientists, construct knowledge. Neurodiversity, the diversity of minds, is an interesting concept when keeping this in mind. Being neurodivergent, or neuroqueer (the viewing of being neurodivergent as a queer thing, along with the intersection of neurodiversity and queerness), means having non-neurotypical ways of perceiving and interacting with the world, and especially of creating knowledge about the rules and regulations, both natural and societal, that govern it locally and broadly. Neuroqueer physicists, therefore, have unique non-normative ways of doing physics, the study of the rules (which is done societally) which govern the natural world. It is imperative that, when teaching neurodivergent students, we encourage and support this non-normative way of thinking about physics, and help them do physics in ways that they will be successful, and support the development of Neuroqueer (Scientific) Literacies, from Kleekamp's and Smilges's works on literacy.

Immersed figure-8 annuli and anyons,Bowen Shi,"Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can immerse in a disk or a sphere as a ""figure-8"", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects.

Invariant Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Ordinary Differential   Equations,"Shivam Arora, Alex Bihlo, Francis Valiquette","Physics-informed neural networks have emerged as a prominent new method for solving differential equations. While conceptually straightforward, they often suffer training difficulties that lead to relatively large discretization errors or the failure to obtain correct solutions. In this paper we introduce invariant physics-informed neural networks for ordinary differential equations that admit a finite-dimensional group of Lie point symmetries. Using the method of equivariant moving frames, a differential equation is invariantized to obtain a, generally, simpler equation in the space of differential invariants. A solution to the invariantized equation is then mapped back to a solution of the original differential equation by solving the reconstruction equations for the left moving frame. The invariantized differential equation together with the reconstruction equations are solved using a physics-informed neural network, and form what we call an invariant physics-informed neural network. We illustrate the method with several examples, all of which considerably outperform standard non-invariant physics-informed neural networks.",2023-10-25T23:26:51Z,2024-03-11T21:24:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17053v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17053v2,"math-ph, math.MP, 58D19"
Bias in physics peer recognition does not explain gaps in perceived   recognition,"Meagan Sundstrom, N. G. Holmes","Gaining recognition as a physics person by peers is an important contributor to undergraduate students' physics identity and their success in physics courses. Previous research has separately demonstrated that women perceive less recognition from peers than men in their physics courses (perceived recognition) and that women receive fewer nominations from their peers as strong in their physics course than men (received recognition). The relationship between perceived and received peer recognition for men and women, however, is not well understood. Here we test three plausible models for this relationship. We conduct a large-scale, quantitative study of over 1,700 students enrolled in introductory physics courses at eight institutions in the United States. We directly compare student gender, perceived recognition, and received recognition, controlling for other student demographics and course-level variability. Results show with high precision that, for students receiving the same amount of recognition, and having the same race or ethnicity, academic year, and major, women report significantly lower perceived recognition than men.

PF-DMD: Physics-fusion dynamic mode decomposition for accurate and   robust forecasting of dynamical systems with imperfect data and physics,"Yuhui Yin, Chenhui Kou, Shengkun Jia, Lu Lu, Xigang Yuan, Yiqing Luo","The DMD (Dynamic Mode Decomposition) method has attracted widespread attention as a representative modal-decomposition method and can build a predictive model. However, the DMD may give predicted results that deviate from physical reality in some scenarios, such as dealing with translation problems or noisy data. Therefore, this paper proposes a physics-fusion dynamic mode decomposition (PFDMD) method to address this issue. The proposed PFDMD method first obtains a data-driven model using DMD, then calculates the residual of the physical equations, and finally corrects the predicted results using Kalman filtering and gain coefficients. In this way, the PFDMD method can integrate the physics-informed equations with the data-driven model generated by DMD. Numerical experiments are conducted using the PFDMD, including the Allen-Cahn, advection-diffusion, and Burgers' equations. The results demonstrate that the proposed PFDMD method can significantly reduce the reconstruction and prediction errors by incorporating physics-informed equations, making it usable for translation and shock problems where the standard DMD method has failed.",2023-11-27T07:54:57Z,2023-11-28T03:33:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15604v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15604v2,physics.comp-ph
Searching for New Physics in Hadronic Final States with Run 2   Proton-Proton Collision Data at the LHC,Steven Schramm,"The symmetries of the Standard Model give rise to the forces that act on particles, and the corresponding force mediators. While the Standard Model is an excellent description of particle interactions, it has known limitations; it is therefore important to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model, potentially indicating as-of-yet unknown symmetries of nature. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have detailed physics programmes, involving a large number of searches for new physics in hadronic final states. As the start of Run 3 of the LHC is imminent, now is a good time to review the progress made and the status of hadronic searches during Run 2 at a centre-of-mass collision energy of 13 TeV. This review provides an overview of the motivations and challenges of hadronic final states at the LHC, followed by an introduction to jet reconstruction, calibration, and tagging. Three classes of searches for new physics in hadronic final states are discussed: di-jet searches, searches for missing transverse momentum in association with another object, and searches for hadronic di-boson resonances. The complementarity of these different analysis strategies is discussed, emphasising the importance of a varied hadronic physics programme in the search for new physics.",2023-11-27T18:01:27Z,2023-11-27T18:01:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16040v1,hep-ex
Attention-enhanced neural differential equations for physics-informed   deep learning of ion transport,"Danyal Rehman, John H. Lienhard","Species transport models typically combine partial differential equations (PDEs) with relations from hindered transport theory to quantify electromigrative, convective, and diffusive transport through complex nanoporous systems; however, these formulations are frequently substantial simplifications of the governing dynamics, leading to the poor generalization performance of PDE-based models. Given the growing interest in deep learning methods for the physical sciences, we develop a machine learning-based approach to characterize ion transport across nanoporous membranes. Our proposed framework centers around attention-enhanced neural differential equations that incorporate electroneutrality-based inductive biases to improve generalization performance relative to conventional PDE-based methods. In addition, we study the role of the attention mechanism in illuminating physically-meaningful ion-pairing relationships across diverse mixture compositions. Further, we investigate the importance of pre-training on simulated data from PDE-based models, as well as the performance benefits from hard vs. soft inductive biases. Our results indicate that physics-informed deep learning solutions can outperform their classical PDE-based counterparts and provide promising avenues for modelling complex transport phenomena across diverse applications.",2023-12-05T16:39:24Z,2023-12-05T16:39:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02871v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02871v1,"cs.LG, math-ph, math.MP, physics.comp-ph"
$ρ$-Diffusion: A diffusion-based density estimation framework for   computational physics,"Maxwell X. Cai, Kin Long Kelvin Lee","In physics, density $\rho(\cdot)$ is a fundamentally important scalar function to model, since it describes a scalar field or a probability density function that governs a physical process. Modeling $\rho(\cdot)$ typically scales poorly with parameter space, however, and quickly becomes prohibitively difficult and computationally expensive. One promising avenue to bypass this is to leverage the capabilities of denoising diffusion models often used in high-fidelity image generation to parameterize $\rho(\cdot)$ from existing scientific data, from which new samples can be trivially sampled from. In this paper, we propose $\rho$-Diffusion, an implementation of denoising diffusion probabilistic models for multidimensional density estimation in physics, which is currently in active development and, from our results, performs well on physically motivated 2D and 3D density functions. Moreover, we propose a novel hashing technique that allows $\rho$-Diffusion to be conditioned by arbitrary amounts of physical parameters of interest.",2023-12-13T14:05:35Z,2023-12-13T14:05:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08153v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08153v1,"physics.comp-ph, cs.LG"

"Emerging Jordan forms, with applications to critical statistical models   and conformal field theory",Lawrence Liu,"Two novel frameworks for handling mathematical and physical problems are introduced. The first, the emerging Jordan form, generalizes the concept of the Jordan canonical form, a well-established tool of linear algebra. The second, dual Jordan quantum physics, generalizes the framework of quantum physics to one in which the hermiticity postulate is considerably relaxed. These frameworks are then used to resolve some long-outstanding problems in theoretical physics, coming from critical statistical models and conformal field theory. I describe these problems and the difficulties involved in finding satisfactory solutions, then show how the concepts of emerging Jordan forms and dual Jordan quantum physics are naturally suited to overcoming these difficulties. Although their applications in this work are limited in scope to rather specific problems, the frameworks themselves are completely general, and I describe ways in which they may be used in other areas of mathematics and physics.

Precise-Physics Driven Text-to-3D Generation,"Qingshan Xu, Jiao Liu, Melvin Wong, Caishun Chen, Yew-Soon Ong","Text-to-3D generation has shown great promise in generating novel 3D content based on given text prompts. However, existing generative methods mostly focus on geometric or visual plausibility while ignoring precise physics perception for the generated 3D shapes. This greatly hinders the practicality of generated 3D shapes in real-world applications. In this work, we propose Phy3DGen, a precise-physics-driven text-to-3D generation method. By analyzing the solid mechanics of generated 3D shapes, we reveal that the 3D shapes generated by existing text-to-3D generation methods are impractical for real-world applications as the generated 3D shapes do not conform to the laws of physics. To this end, we leverage 3D diffusion models to provide 3D shape priors and design a data-driven differentiable physics layer to optimize 3D shape priors with solid mechanics. This allows us to optimize geometry efficiently and learn precise physics information about 3D shapes at the same time.

Understanding Physical Breakdowns in Virtual Reality,Wen-Jie Tseng,"Virtual Reality (VR) moves away from well-controlled laboratory environments into public and personal spaces. As users are visually disconnected from the physical environment, interacting in an uncontrolled space frequently leads to collisions and raises safety concerns. In my thesis, I investigate this phenomenon which I define as the physical breakdown in VR. The goal is to understand the reasons for physical breakdowns, provide solutions, and explore future mechanisms that could perpetuate safety risks. First, I explored the reasons for physical breakdowns by investigating how people interact with the current VR safety mechanism (e.g., Oculus Guardian). Results show one reason for breaking out of the safety boundary is when interacting with large motions (e.g., swinging arms), the user does not have enough time to react although they see the safety boundary. I proposed a solution, FingerMapper, that maps small-scale finger motions onto virtual arms and hands to enable whole-body virtual arm motions in VR to avoid physical breakdowns. To demonstrate future safety risks, I explored the malicious use of perceptual manipulations (e.g., redirection techniques) in VR, which could deliberately create physical breakdowns without users noticing. Results indicate further open challenges about the cognitive process of how users comprehend their physical environment when they are blindfolded in VR.",2024-03-20T18:03:54Z,2024-03-20T18:03:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00025v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00025v1,cs.HC

DeepRacer on Physical Track: Parameters Exploration and Performance   Evaluation,"Sinan Koparan, Bahman Javadi","This paper focuses on the physical racetrack capabilities of AWS DeepRacer. Two separate experiments were conducted. The first experiment (Experiment I) focused on evaluating the impact of hyperparameters on the physical environment. Hyperparameters such as gradient descent batch size and loss type were changed systematically as well as training time settings. The second experiment (Experiment II) focused on exploring AWS DeepRacer object avoidance in the physical environment. It was uncovered that in the simulated environment, models with a higher gradient descent batch size had better performance than models with a lower gradient descent batch size. Alternatively, in the physical environment, a gradient descent batch size of 128 appears to be preferable. It was found that models using the loss type of Huber outperformed models that used the loss type of MSE in both the simulated and physical environments. Finally, object avoidance in the simulated environment appeared to be effective; however, when bringing these models to the physical environment, there was a pronounced challenge to avoid objects. Therefore, object avoidance in the physical environment remains an open challenge.",2024-06-06T06:17:27Z,2024-06-06T06:17:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03769v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03769v1,"cs.LG, cs.RO"
Intra-QLAN Connectivity: beyond the Physical Topology,"Francesco Mazza, Marcello Caleffi, Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","In the near to mid future, Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) -- the fundamental building block of the Quantum Internet -- will unlike exhibit physical topologies characterized by densely physical connections among the nodes. On the contrary, it is pragmatic to consider QLANs based on simpler, scarcely-connected physical topologies, such as star topologies. This constraint -- if not properly tackled -- will significantly impact the QLAN performance in terms of communication delay and/or overhead. Thankfully, it is possible to create on-demand links between QLAN nodes, without physically deploying them, by properly manipulating a shared multipartite entangled state. Thus, it is possible to build an overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one. In this paper, we address the fundamental issue of engineering the artificial topology of a QLAN to bypass the limitations induced by the physical topology. The designed framework relays only on local operations, without exchanging signaling among the QLAN nodes, which, in turn, would introduce further delays in a scenario very sensitive to the decoherence. Finally, by exploiting the artificial topology, it is proved that the troubleshooting is simplified, by overcoming the single point of failure, typical of classical LAN star topologies.",2024-06-14T12:12:36Z,2024-06-14T12:12:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09963v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09963v1,"quant-ph, cs.NI"
Physically Embodied Gaussian Splatting: A Realtime Correctable World   Model for Robotics,"Jad Abou-Chakra, Krishan Rana, Feras Dayoub, Niko Sünderhauf","For robots to robustly understand and interact with the physical world, it is highly beneficial to have a comprehensive representation - modelling geometry, physics, and visual observations - that informs perception, planning, and control algorithms. We propose a novel dual Gaussian-Particle representation that models the physical world while (i) enabling predictive simulation of future states and (ii) allowing online correction from visual observations in a dynamic world. Our representation comprises particles that capture the geometrical aspect of objects in the world and can be used alongside a particle-based physics system to anticipate physically plausible future states. Attached to these particles are 3D Gaussians that render images from any viewpoint through a splatting process thus capturing the visual state. By comparing the predicted and observed images, our approach generates visual forces that correct the particle positions while respecting known physical constraints. By integrating predictive physical modelling with continuous visually-derived corrections, our unified representation reasons about the present and future while synchronizing with reality. Our system runs in realtime at 30Hz using only 3 cameras. We validate our approach on 2D and 3D tracking tasks as well as photometric reconstruction quality.

Beyond Answers: Large Language Model-Powered Tutoring System in Physics   Education for Deep Learning and Precise Understanding,"Zhoumingju Jiang, Mengjun Jiang","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has shown significant promise, yet the effective personalization of learning, particularly in physics education, remains a challenge. This paper proposes Physics-STAR, a framework for large language model (LLM)- powered tutoring system designed to address this gap by providing personalized and adaptive learning experiences for high school students. Our study evaluates Physics-STAR against traditional teacher-led lectures and generic LLM tutoring through a controlled experiment with 12 high school sophomores. Results showed that Physics-STAR increased students' average scores and efficiency on conceptual, computational, and on informational questions. In particular, students' average scores on complex information problems increased by 100% and their efficiency increased by 5.95%. By facilitating step-by-step guidance and reflective learning, Physics-STAR helps students develop critical thinking skills and a robust comprehension of abstract concepts.

Latent Intuitive Physics: Learning to Transfer Hidden Physics from A 3D   Video,"Xiangming Zhu, Huayu Deng, Haochen Yuan, Yunbo Wang, Xiaokang Yang","We introduce latent intuitive physics, a transfer learning framework for physics simulation that can infer hidden properties of fluids from a single 3D video and simulate the observed fluid in novel scenes. Our key insight is to use latent features drawn from a learnable prior distribution conditioned on the underlying particle states to capture the invisible and complex physical properties. To achieve this, we train a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, and both the particle states and the visual posterior are obtained from a learned neural renderer. The converged prior learner is embedded in our probabilistic physics engine, allowing us to perform novel simulations on unseen geometries, boundaries, and dynamics without knowledge of the true physical parameters. We validate our model in three ways: (i) novel scene simulation with the learned visual-world physics, (ii) future prediction of the observed fluid dynamics, and (iii) supervised particle simulation.

Statistical Analysis on Scale and Regional Distribution of Undergraduate   Physics Programs in Korean Universities,"Gahyoun Gim, Sang Hoon Lee","We report on the temporal changes in undergraduate-level physics programs at Korean universities from 1915 to 2023 by analyzing data on physics-related departments and their students using basic statistics and the scaling theory of statistical physics. Our analysis reveals that the number of departments peaked around the turn of the 21st century, and it has been steadily decreasing ever since, with particularly severe declines in private universities located outside the capital region. Besides the change in the overall numbers, we also show the change in the self-identity of physics-related departments reflected in department names, which reveals a recent trend of emphasizing more application-side such as semiconductors and data. As a sophisticated measure to quantify regional imbalances relative to the population eligible for higher education, we present scaling exponents from the scaling theory, which shows a shift from sublinear to linear for departments and a shift from linear to superlinear for students.

We examine interest formation through the lens of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) by exploring four key SCCT constructs: learning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and proximal environmental influences. We conducted 27 interviews with physics majors across various years of study between 2020 and 2022. Our first research question analyzes SCCT constructs to provide detailed insights into the interest formation of various subfields of physics. Examining these constructs, we better understand the factors influencing students' preferences toward specific subfields. Our findings indicate that positive class experiences and experimental opportunities significantly impacted students' interest in different subfields of physics.

Smith,"This review focuses on diffractive physics, which involves the long-range interactions of the strong nuclear force at high energies described by SU(3) gauge symmetry. It is expected that diffractive processes account for nearly 40% of the total cross-section at LHC energies. These processes consist of soft-scale physics where perturbation theory cannot be applied. Although highly successful and often described as a perfect theory, quantum chromodynamics relies heavily on perturbation theory, a model best suited for hard-scale physics. The study of pomerons could help bridge the soft and hard processes and provide a complete description of the theory of the strong interaction across the full momentum spectrum. Here, we will discuss some of the features of diffractive physics, experimental results from SPS, HERA, and the LHC, and where the field could potentially lead. With the recent publication of the odderon discovery in 2021 by the D0 and TOTEM collaborations and the new horizon of physics that lies ahead with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, interest is seemingly piquing in high energy diffractive physics.",2024-07-23T20:56:23Z,2024-07-23T20:56:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16835v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16835v1,"nucl-ex, hep-ph"
Multi-physics Simulation Guided Generative Diffusion Models with   Applications in Fluid and Heat Dynamics,"Naichen Shi, Hao Yan, Shenghan Guo, Raed Al Kontar","In this paper, we present a generic physics-informed generative model called MPDM that integrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with diffusion models. MPDM categorizes multi-fidelity physics simulations into inexpensive and expensive simulations, depending on computational costs. The inexpensive simulations, which can be obtained with low latency, directly inject contextual information into DDMs. Furthermore, when results from expensive simulations are available, MPDM refines the quality of generated samples via a guided diffusion process. This design separates the training of a denoising diffusion model from physics-informed conditional probability models, thus lending flexibility to practitioners. MPDM builds on Bayesian probabilistic models and is equipped with a theoretical guarantee that provides upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the sample and underlying true distribution. The probabilistic nature of MPDM also provides a convenient approach for uncertainty quantification in prediction. Our models excel in cases where physics simulations are imperfect and sometimes inaccessible. We use a numerical simulation in fluid dynamics and a case study in heat dynamics within laser-based metal powder deposition additive manufacturing to demonstrate how MPDM seamlessly integrates multi-idelity physics simulations and observations to obtain surrogates with superior predictive performance.",2024-07-25T02:45:58Z,2024-07-25T02:45:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17720v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17720v1,"stat.CO, physics.comp-ph"
Motivating Gauge-Invariant Approaches to Particle Physics,Philipp Berghofer,"There is noticeable consensus among physicists and philosophers that only gauge-invariant quantities can be physically real. However, this insight that physical quantities must be gauge-invariant is not well-reflected in standard approaches to particle physics. For instance, each and every elementary field/particle of the Standard Model fails to be gauge-invariant! The main objective of this paper is to offer an accessible, concise, and convincing analysis of why philosophers and physicists should devote more of their energy to working on gauge-invariant approaches. Correspondingly, the thesis of this paper is that pursuing gauge-invariant approaches has several virtues. For instance, gauge-invariant reformulations allow us to make particle physics consistent with the mathematical framework in which it is formulated. This is illustrated by how mathematical theorems such as Elitzur's theorem, the Gribov ambiguity, and Haag's theorem pose problems for standard approaches but are avoided by gauge-invariant approaches.",2024-08-21T15:29:54Z,2024-08-21T15:29:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11705v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11705v1,"physics.hist-ph, hep-ph, hep-th"
TG-PhyNN: An Enhanced Physically-Aware Graph Neural Network framework   for forecasting Spatio-Temporal Data,"Zakaria Elabid, Lena Sasal, Daniel Busby, Abdenour Hadid","Accurately forecasting dynamic processes on graphs, such as traffic flow or disease spread, remains a challenge. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data.

Students' Experience of Cultural Differences Between Mathematics and   Physics,"Jeffrey M.

In addition to specific mathematical methods in specific physics contexts, possible effects of more general ""cultural"" differences between the two disciplines have also been explored. However, there has been little examination of students' own awareness and interpretation of these differences. We explore the undergraduate student experience of these ""cultural"" contrasts, focusing on how they impact learning and problem-solving. Through a qualitative study, including surveys and interviews with students double-majoring in mathematics and physics (or majoring in one and minoring in the other), we investigate students' awareness of distinct pedagogical approaches, mathematical justifications, and organization of concepts in mathematics versus physics classes. We find that students do recognize and navigate these ""cultural"" differences, often employing specific coping strategies. We identify specific themes from our data and comment on how students feel that these themes impact their learning.

What is a physical theory? Philosophers do have an answer by   distinguishing two forms of empirical adequacy,Jorge Manero,"What is a physical theory? Although this intriguing question has been addressed from many different perspectives, some physicists and philosophers of physics have implicitly or explicitly embraced a philosophically-neutral definition of a physical theory, independently of the philosophical position endorsed with respect to it. Considering some objections against this view, I shall argue that the most appropriate definition of a physical theory already presupposes some commitments shared by a philosophical position associated with scientific realism. As we shall see, what physical theories and scientific realist positions have in common is the commitment of satisfying a non-factive notion of empirical adequacy, whilst a factive notion of empirical adequacy shall be solely associated with scientific realism. Based on this factive/non-factive distinction, we shall finally present a case study in physics in order to show that a well-known foundational problem associated with the concept of manifest time can be dissolved once the non-factive notion of empirical adequacy (as opposed to factive one) is endorsed.",2024-10-06T05:13:04Z,2024-11-07T21:25:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04362v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04362v2,physics.hist-ph
GPS Observables in Newtonian Spacetime or Why We Do Not Need 'Physical'   Coordinate Systems,Álvaro Mozota Frauca,"Some authors have defended the claim that one needs to be able to define 'physical coordinate systems' and 'observables' in order to make sense of general relativity. Moreover, in Rovelli (Physical Review D, 65(4), 044017 2002), Rovelli proposes a way of implementing these ideas by making use of a system of satellites that allows defining a set of 'physical coordinates', the GPS coordinates. In this article I oppose these views in four ways. First, I defend an alternative way of understanding general relativity which implies that we have a perfectly fine interpretation of the models of the theory even in the absence of 'physical coordinate systems'. Second, I analyze and challenge the motivations behind the 'observable' view. Third, I analyze Rovelli's proposal and I conclude that it does not allow extracting any physical information from our models that wasn't available before. Fourth, I draw an analogy between general relativistic spacetimes and Newtonian spacetimes, which allows me to argue that as 'physical observables' are not needed in Newtonian spacetime, then neither are they in general relativity.

Adaptive Physics-Guided Neural Network,"David Shulman, Itai Dattner","This paper introduces an adaptive physics-guided neural network (APGNN) framework for predicting quality attributes from image data by integrating physical laws into deep learning models. The APGNN adaptively balances data-driven and physics-informed predictions, enhancing model accuracy and robustness across different environments. Our approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with comparisons to conventional data-driven models such as ResNet. For the synthetic data, 2D domains were generated using three distinct governing equations: the diffusion equation, the advection-diffusion equation, and the Poisson equation. Non-linear transformations were applied to these domains to emulate complex physical processes in image form.   In real-world experiments, the APGNN consistently demonstrated superior performance in the diverse thermal image dataset. On the cucumber dataset, characterized by low material diversity and controlled conditions, APGNN and PGNN showed similar performance, both outperforming the data-driven ResNet. However, in the more complex thermal dataset, particularly for outdoor materials with higher environmental variability, APGNN outperformed both PGNN and ResNet by dynamically adjusting its reliance on physics-based versus data-driven insights. This adaptability allowed APGNN to maintain robust performance across structured, low-variability settings and more heterogeneous scenarios.

These technologies are now so mature that they can be applied to various fields.

In general, quantum sensing enables high-precision measurements, opening ways to investigate high-energy phenomena that slightly modify energy levels of low-energy systems by higher-order perturbations. In other cases, such high-precision measurements are sensitive to faint low-energy interactions between the low-energy system and exotic fields. These measurements open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated topics, e.g., variations of fundamental constants, dark matter, fifth force, parity violation, CP-violation, supersymmetric theories, and other physics beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, such measurements can serve as confirmations for existing results from completely different systems, or surpass existing results using smaller-scale experiments.

Network dismantling by physical damage,"Luka Blagojević, Ivan Bonamassa, Márton Pósfai","We explore the robustness of complex networks against physical damage. We focus on spatially embedded network models and datasets where links are physical objects or physically transfer some quantity, which can be disrupted at any point along its trajectory. To simulate physical damage, we tile the networks with boxes of equal size and sequentially damage them. By introducing an intersection graph to keep track of the links passing through tiles, we systematically analyze the connectivity of the network and explore how the physical layout and the topology of the network jointly affect its percolation threshold. We show that random layouts make networks extremely vulnerable to physical damage, driven by the presence of very elongated links, and that higher-dimensional embeddings further increase their vulnerability. We compare this picture against targeted physical damages, showing that it accelerates network dismantling and yields non-trivial geometric patterns. Finally, we apply our framework to several empirical networks, from airline networks to vascular systems and the brain, showing qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.",2024-12-12T18:11:04Z,2024-12-12T18:11:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09524v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09524v1,cond-mat.stat-mech

Towards Physically Interpretable World Models: Meaningful Weakly   Supervised Representations for Visual Trajectory Prediction,"Zhenjiang Mao, Ivan Ruchkin","Deep learning models are increasingly employed for perception, prediction, and control in complex systems. Embedding physical knowledge into these models is crucial for achieving realistic and consistent outputs, a challenge often addressed by physics-informed machine learning. However, integrating physical knowledge with representation learning becomes difficult when dealing with high-dimensional observation data, such as images, particularly under conditions of incomplete or imprecise state information. To address this, we propose Physically Interpretable World Models, a novel architecture that aligns learned latent representations with real-world physical quantities. Our method combines a variational autoencoder with a dynamical model that incorporates unknown system parameters, enabling the discovery of physically meaningful representations. By employing weak supervision with interval-based constraints, our approach eliminates the reliance on ground-truth physical annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the quality of learned representations while achieving accurate predictions of future states, advancing the field of representation learning in dynamic systems.",2024-12-17T12:51:24Z,2025-01-27T18:13:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12870v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12870v2,cs.LG
New Physics at the Muon (Synchrotron) Ion Collider: MuSIC for several   scales,"Hooman Davoudiasl, Hongkai Liu, Roman Marcarelli, Yotam Soreq, Sokratis Trifinopoulos","A Muon (Synchrotron) Ion Collider (MuSIC) can be the successor to the Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, as well as the ideal demonstrator facility for a future multi-TeV Muon Collider. Besides its rich nuclear physics and Standard Model particle physics programs, in this work we show that the MuSIC with a TeV-scale muon beam offers also a unique opportunity to probe New Physics. In particular, the relevant searches have the potential to surpass current experimental limits and explore new regimes of the parameter space for a variety of Beyond the Standard Model scenarios including: lepton-flavor violating leptoquarks, muonphilic vector boson interactions, axion-like particles coupling to photons, and heavy sterile neutrinos. Depending on the particular case, the sensitivity of the searches in the MuSIC may span a wide range of energy scales, namely from sub-GeV particles to the few TeV New Physics mediators.

Towards Quantum Gravity: A Framework for Probabilistic Theories with   Non-Fixed Causal Structure,Lucien Hardy,"General relativity is a deterministic theory with non-fixed causal structure. Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. In this paper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal structure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum theory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical theory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of quantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We apply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to quantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular region of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is a second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above the first level physical compression for the component regions. Each application of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a matrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical theory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of physical compression. This third level of physical compression gives rise to a new mathematical object which we call the causaloid. From the causaloid for a particular physical theory we can calculate verything the physical theory can calculate. This approach allows us to set up a framework for calculating probabilistic correlations in data without imposing a fixed causal structure (such as a background time). We show how to put quantum theory in this framework (thus providing a new formulation of this theory). We indicate how general relativity might be put into this framework and how the framework might be used to construct a theory of quantum gravity.",2006-08-09T17:39:15Z,2006-08-09T17:39:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0608043v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0608043v1,"gr-qc, hep-th, quant-ph"
Crowded Charges in Ion Channels,Bob Eisenberg,"Ions in water are the liquid of life. Life occurs almost entirely in 'salt water'. Water itself (without ions) is lethal to animal cells and damaging for most proteins. Water must contain the right ions in the right amounts if it is to sustain life. Physical chemistry is the language of electrolyte solutions. Physical chemistry and biology are intertwined. Physical chemists and biologists come from different traditions that separated for several decades as biologists described the molecules of life. Communication is not easy between a fundamentally descriptive tradition and a fundamentally analytical one. Biologists have now learned to study well defined systems with physical techniques, of considerable interest to physical chemists. Physical chemists are increasingly interested in spatially inhomogeneous systems with structures on the atomic scale so common in biology. Physical chemists will find it productive to work on well defined systems built by evolution to be reasonably robust, with input output relations insensitive to environmental insults. This article deals with properties of ion channels that in my view can be dealt with by 'physics as usual', with much the same tools that physical chemists apply to other systems. Indeed, I introduce and use a tool of physicists-a field theory (and boundary conditions) based on an energy variational approach developed by Chun Liu-not too widely used among physical chemists. My goal is to provide the knowledge base, and identify the assumptions, that biologists use in studying ion channels, avoiding jargon. Rather simple models of selectivity and permeation in ion channels work quite well in important cases. Those physical models and cases are the main focus of this review because they demonstrate the strong essential link between the traditional treatments of ions in chemical physics, and the biological function of ion channels.",2010-09-09T14:08:20Z,2010-09-09T14:08:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1786v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.1786v1,"q-bio.BM, cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph"
Recent Progress in Low Energy Neutrino Scattering Physics and Its   Implications for the Standard and Beyond the Standard Model Physics,V. Pandey,"Neutrinos continue to provide a testing ground for the structure of the standard model of particle physics as well as hints towards the physics beyond the standard model. Neutrinos of energies spanning over several orders of magnitude, originating in many terrestrial and astrophysical processes, have been detected via various decay and interaction mechanisms. At MeV scales, there has been one elusive process, until a few years ago, known as coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) that was theoretically predicted over five decades ago but was never observed experimentally. The recent experimental observation of the CEvNS process by the COHERENT collaboration at a stopped pion neutrino source has inspired physicists across many subfields. This has vital implications for nuclear physics, high-energy physics, astrophysics, and beyond. CEvNS, being a low-energy process, provides a natural window to study light, weakly-coupled, new physics in the neutrino sector.   In this review, we intend to provide the current status of low energy neutrino scattering physics and its implications for the standard and beyond the standard model physics. We discuss the general formalism of calculating the tree-level CEvNS cross section and present estimated theoretical uncertainties on the CEvNS cross section stemming from different sources. We also discuss the inelastic scattering of tens of MeV neutrinos that have implications for supernova detection in future neutrino experiments. We discuss how the CEvNS experiments can be used as a testing ground for the Standard Model (SM) weak physics as well as in searching for the Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signals. Any deviation from the SM predicted event rate either with a change in the total event rate or with a change in the shape of the recoil spectrum, could indicate new contributions to the interaction cross-section.",2023-09-14T16:36:36Z,2023-09-14T16:36:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07840v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07840v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex, nucl-ex, nucl-th"
"Role of Mentorship, Career Conceptualization, and Leadership in   Developing Women's Physics Identity and Belonging","Jessica L. Rosenberg, Nancy Holincheck, Kathryn Fernández, Benjamin W. Dreyfus, Fardousa Wardere, Stephanie Stehle, Tiffany N. Butler","The percentage of women receiving bachelors degrees in physics in the U.S. lags well behind that of men, and women leave the major at higher rates. Achieving equity in physics will mean that women stay in physics at the same rates as men, but this will require changes in the culture and support structures. A strong sense of belonging can lead to higher retention rates so interventions meant to increase dimensions of physics identity (interest, recognition, performance, and competence) may increase persistence overall and increase women's retention differentially. We describe our model in which mentorship, an understanding of career options (career conceptualization), and leadership are inputs into the development of these dimensions of physics identity. This paper includes preliminary results from a qualitative study that aims to better understand how career conceptualization, leadership, and mentorship contribute to the development of physics identity and belonging. We report results from a survey of 15 undergraduate physics students which was followed up by interviews with 5 of those students. The students were from a small private liberal arts college in the midwest region of the U.S. and a large public university in the southeast region of the U.S. classified as a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). With respect to mentorship, we found that it could provide critical support for students' engagement in the physics community. Leadership experiences have not previously been positioned as an important input into identity, yet we found that they helped women in physics feel more confident, contributing to their recognition of themselves as physics people. While the data on how career conceptualization contributed to the building of identity is limited, there are some connections to recognition and competence, and it will be an interesting avenue of future exploration.",2024-02-03T18:42:33Z,2024-02-03T18:42:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02236v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02236v1,physics.ed-ph

For $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing, a non-vanishing CP asymmetry (above a few percent) $a_{CP}(B_s \rightarrow D_s^+ D_s^-)$ is a clear signal of New Physics.

They provide a formal framework that subsumes both classical boolean logic concerned with sets and subsets and quantum logic concerned with Hilbert space, closed subspaces and projections. They shed light on the role of the phase factors that are central to Quantum Physics. The generalization of the notion of a self-adjoint operator to SP-structures provides a novel notion that is free of linear algebra.",2008-05-06T14:21:39Z,2008-05-06T14:21:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0726v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.0726v1,quant-ph

Review of the Topos Approach to Quantum Theory,Cecilia Flori,"Topos theory has been suggested by D\""oring and Isham as an alternative mathematical structure with which to formulate physical theories. In particular, the topos approach suggests a radical new way of thinking about what a theory of physics is and what its conceptual framework looks like. The motivation of using topos theory to express quantum theory lies in the desire to overcome certain interpretational problems inherent in the standard formulation of the theory. In particular, the topos reformulation of quantum theory overcomes the instrumentalist/Copenhagen interpretation thereby rendering the theory more realist. In the process one ends up with a multivalued/intuitionistic logic rather than a Boolean logic. In this article we shall review some of these developments.",2011-06-28T13:39:17Z,2011-06-28T13:39:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5660v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.5660v1,"math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"

Even in Wigner's friend scenarios, differently situated agents agree on the objective content of statements about the values of physical magnitudes. In more realistic circumstances quantum Darwinism also permits differently situated agents equal observational access to evaluate their truth. In this view, quantum theory has nothing to say about consciousness or conscious experiences of observers.

Finally, we will focus in how, still today, anti-realist realism continues to rule the contemporary post-modern research in both (quantum) physics and philosophy.",2023-06-24T14:09:20Z,2023-06-24T14:09:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13975v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13975v1,"physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"
Implicit Quantile Networks For Emulation in Jet Physics,"B. Kronheim, A. Al Kadhim, M. P. Kuchera, H. B. Prosper, R. Ramanujan","The ability to model and sample from conditional densities is important in many physics applications. Implicit quantile networks (IQN) have been successfully applied to this task in domains outside physics. In this work, we illustrate the potential of IQNs as components of emulators using the simulation of jets as an example. Specifically, we use an IQN to map jets described by their 4-momenta at the generation level to jets at the event reconstruction level. The conditional densities emulated by our model closely match those generated by $\texttt{Delphes}$, while also enabling faster jet simulation.",2023-06-26T20:20:35Z,2024-12-19T20:38:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15053v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15053v2,"physics.comp-ph, hep-ph"

Pendulums: the Simple and the Physical,Zhiwei Chong,"This paper aims to show how to guide students with a familiar example to extract as much physics as possible before jumping into mathematical calculation. The period for a physical pendulum made up of a uniform rod is changed by attaching a piece of putty on it. The period for the combined system depends on the location of the putty. Simple reasoning without calculation shows that there are two locations for the putty that do not change the period of the physical pendulum: the axis and the center of percussion. Moreover, without calculation, we reason that there is at least one minimal period when the putty lies somewhere between these two locations.",2023-07-28T03:59:55Z,2023-07-28T03:59:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00603v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00603v1,physics.class-ph

Non-topological solitons and quasi-solitons,Shuang-Yong Zhou,"Solitons in relativistic field theories are not necessarily topologically charged. In particular, non-topological solitons -- known as Q-balls -- arise naturally in nonlinear field theories endowed with attractive interactions and internal symmetries. Even without stabilizing internal symmetries, quasi-solitons known as oscillons, which are long-lived, can also exist.

We address this issue by introducing a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion.

Different parametrizations of the field functions and harmonic analysis on the homogeneous spaces are studied. It is shown that a direct product of Minkowski spacetime and two-dimensional complex sphere is the most suitable homogeneous space for the subsequent physical applications. The Lagrangian formalism and field equations on the Poincar\'{e} group are considered. A boundary value problem for the relativistically invariant system is defined. General solutions of this problem are expressed via an expansion in hyperspherical harmonics on the complex two-sphere. A physical sense of the boundary conditions is discussed. The boundary value problems of the same type are studied for the Dirac and Maxwell fields. In turn, general solutions of these problems are expressed via convergent Fourier type series. Field operators, quantizations, causal commutators and vacuum expectation values of time ordered products of the field operators are defined for the Dirac and Maxwell fields, respectively.

Numerical Methods as an Integrated Part of Physics Education,"Arnt Inge Vistnes, M. Hjorth-Jensen","During the last decade we have witnessed an impressive development in so-called interpreted languages and computational environments such as Maple, Mathematica, IDL, Matlab etc. Problems which until recently were typically solved on mainframe machines and written in computing languages such as Fortran or C/C++, can now easily be solved on standard PCs with the bonus of immediate visualizations of the results.   In our undergraduate programs an often posed question is how to incorporate and exploit efficiently these advances in the standard physics and mathematics curriculum, without detracting the attention from the classical and basic theoretical and experimental topics to be covered. Furthermore, if students are trained to use such tools at early stages in their education, do such tools really enhance and improve the learning environment? And, perhaps even more important, does it lead to a better physics understanding?   Here we present one possible approach, where computational topics are gradually baked into our undergraduate curriculum in Mathematics and Physics, Astronomy and Meteorology. We focus on training our students to use general programming tools in solving physics problems, in addition to the classical analytic problems. By this approach, the students gain an expertise that they can build upon in their future studies and careers. We use mainly Java, Matlab and Maple as computational environments. Our students are now capable of handling at an early stage in their education more realistic physics problems than before.

Celebrating the Physics in Geophysics,"Anthony B. Davis, D. Sornette","As 2005, the International Year of Physics, comes to an end, two physicists working primarily in geophysical research reflect on how geophysics is not an applied physics. Although geophysics has certainly benefited from progress in physics and sometimes emulated the reductionist program of mainstream physics, it has also educated the physics community about some of the generic behaviors of strongly nonlinear systems. Dramatic examples are the insights we have gained into the ``emergent'' phenomena of chaos, cascading instabilities, turbulence, self-organization, fractal structure, power-law variability, anomalous scaling, threshold dynamics, creep, fracture, and so on. In all of these examples, relatively simple models have been able to explain the recurring features of apparently very complex signals and fields. It appears that the future of the intricate relation between physics and geophysics will be as exciting as its past has been characterized by a mutual fascination. Physics departments in our universities should capitalize on this trend to attract and retain young talent motivated to address problems that really matter for the future of the planet. A pressing topic with huge impact on populations and that is challenging enough for both physics and geophysics communities to work together like never before is the understanding and prediction of extreme events.",2005-10-04T16:55:24Z,2005-11-08T01:55:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0510027v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0510027v2,"physics.geo-ph, physics.ed-ph"
"On Math, Matter and Mind","Piet Hut, Mark Alford, Max Tegmark","We discuss the nature of reality in the ontological context of Penrose's math-matter-mind triangle. The triangle suggests the circularity of the widespread view that math arises from the mind, the mind arises out of matter, and that matter can be explained in terms of math. Non-physicists should be wary of any claim that modern physics leads us to any particular resolution of this circularity, since even the sample of three theoretical physicists writing this paper hold three divergent views. Some physicists believe that current physics has already found the basic framework for a complete description of reality, and only has to fill in the details. Others suspect that no single framework, from physics or other sources, will ever capture reality. Yet others guess that reality might be approached arbitrarily closely by some form of future physics, but probably based on completely different frameworks. We will designate these three approaches as the fundamentalist, secular and mystic views of the world, as seen by practicing physicists. We present and contrast each of these views, which arguably form broad categories capturing most if not all interpretations of physics. We argue that this diversity in the physics community is more useful than an ontological monoculture, since it motivates physicists to tackle unsolved problems with a wide variety of approaches.",2005-10-21T02:41:03Z,2006-01-15T12:08:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0510188v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0510188v2,"physics.pop-ph, hep-th, physics.gen-ph"
On the Nature of the Change in the Wave Function in a Measurement in   Quantum Mechanics,Douglas M. Snyder,"Generally a central role has been assigned to an unavoidable physical interaction between the measuring instrument and the physical entity measured in the change in the wave function that often occurs in measurement in quantum mechanics. A survey of textbooks on quantum mechanics by authors such as Dicke and Witke (1960), Eisberg and Resnick (1985), Gasiorowicz (1974), Goswami (1992), and Liboff (1993) supports this point. Furthermore, in line with the view of Bohr and Feynman, generally the unavoidable interaction between a measuring instrument and the physical entity measured is considered responsible for the uncertainty principle. A gedankenexperiment using Feynman's double-hole interference scenario shows that physical interaction is not necessary to effect the change in the wave function that occurs in measurement in quantum mechanics. Instead, the general case is that knowledge is linked to the change in the wave function, not a physical interaction between the physical existent measured and the measuring instrument. Empirical work on electron shelving that involves null measurements, or what Renninger called negative observations (Zeitschrift fur Physik, vol. 158, p. 417), supports these points. Work on electron shelving is reported by Dehmelt and his colleagues (Physical Review Letters, vol. 56, p. 2797), Wineland and his colleagues (Physical Review Letters, vol. 57, p. 1699), and Sauter, Neuhauser, Blatt, and Toschek (Physical Review Letters, vol. 57, p. 1696).",1995-12-19T17:24:59Z,2003-04-06T17:48:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9601006v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9601006v3,quant-ph
"Coupled oscillators, entangled oscillators, and Lorentz-covariant   harmonic oscillators","Y. S. Kim, Marilyn E. Noz","Other than scattering problems where perturbation theory is applicable, there are basically two ways to solve problems in physics. One is to reduce the problem to harmonic oscillators, and the other is to formulate the problem in terms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem combines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then becomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics. Indeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated into another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators provide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics, including entanglement and Feynman's rest of the universe. In addition, it is noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a physics of harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the Lorentz group which can be represented by the group of two-by-two matrices commonly called $SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can play the role of combining quantum mechanics with special relativity. It is therefore possible to relate the current issues of physics to the Lorentz-covariant formulation of quantum mechanics.",2005-02-15T16:22:28Z,2005-02-18T17:45:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502096v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0502096v3,"quant-ph, hep-ph, hep-th"
On the Fundamental Properties of Coupled Oscillating Systems,"Danil Doubochinski, Jonathan Tennenbaum","The present paper presents a new general conception of interaction between physical systems, differing significantly from that of both classical physics and quantum physics as generally understood. We believe this conception could provide the basis for a coherent understanding of several classes of natural phenomena that until now have been studied only in a piece-meal fashion. These include 1) the universal tendency for physical systems to associate together into stable dynamic formations; 2) the seemingly unlimited capacity for generation of physical objects in Nature, including the emergence of coherent, quantized states in physical systems of the most varied nature; 3) the existence of close couplings between processes whose characteristic length-scales, frequency- and energy-ranges differ by many orders of magnitude. The proposed conception first emerged in connection with experimental studies of the nonlinear behavior of coupled electromagnetic oscillators, and the discovery of two fundamental phenomena that had been overlooked in the classical theory of oscillations. The essential features of these phenomena are summarized in the first two sections of the paper, after which we indicate how the underlying physical principles can be combined under a single notion of interaction, providing a mechanism by which a practically unlimited wealth of physical objects could be generated by the interaction of just a few. The final section puts forward some preliminary ideas about the electromagneto-mechanical dual nature of physical objects as oscillatory processes, suggesting a universal scope for the proposed conceptions.",2007-12-16T14:53:53Z,2007-12-16T14:53:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2575v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.2575v1,physics.gen-ph
On the teaching and learning of physics: A Criticism and a Systemic   Approach,Sergio Rojas,"The amount of published research in Physics Education Research (PER) shows, on one hand, an increasing interest in the design and development of high performance physics teaching strategies, and, on the other hand, it tries to understand plausible ways on which the brain processes scientific information so that scientific thinking skills could be taught more effectively. As physics is a subject in which mathematical and conceptual reasoning can not be separated, instructors of physics face the problem of finding suitable advise on the most effective methods of teaching physics (i.e. how much time should be spent on intuitive conceptual reasoning and how much time in developing quantitative reasoning, and how to teach both in a unitary way). In spite the important efforts made by the PER community, the published results are overwhelming and confusing for the physics instructors in the sense that the conclusions that have arisen in those articles are in some instances controversial and far from being conclusive in pointing out a particular strategy to overcome the afore mentioned problem. Accordingly, based on the analysis of published PER work, we'll be arguing that one of the major difficulties to overcome in the teaching of physics could be associated to the lack of a consistent and coherent methodological framework for teaching which integrates both aspects, conceptual and mathematical reasoning, in a systemic way of thinking. We will be presenting a set of plausible steps that could be applied to tackle the aforementioned difficulty.",2009-02-06T18:04:11Z,2009-02-06T18:04:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1151v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.1151v1,"physics.ed-ph, physics.gen-ph"

Can Physics Teaching be improved by Explanation of Tricks with a   Motorcycle?,Matthias R. Risch,"A priority of physics instruction is to help students make the connection between the formulae they think they are required to memorize and the real world in which they interact every day. If you ask students to describe a situation in real life involving physical principles, the most commonly cited examples will pertain to vehicular motion. One situation in real life involving physical principles is vehicle dynamics. Even students who have little interest in physics eagerly discuss problems like how much a car can decelerate travelling in a flat turn or how tricks like the Wheely can be performed on a motorcycle. In the physics classroom, the motion of automotive vehicles is probably the most interesting manifestation of the principles of physics. The laws of physics limiting movements of vehicles are deduced here in a simple derivation suited for classroom demonstration as well as for homework. Due to limits on frictional forces there are subsequent limits for acceleration, deceleration and speed in a flat turn. Frictional forces also determine the behaviour of a vehicle at rapid speed in a turn.",2010-08-30T10:08:38Z,2010-10-14T12:02:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5041v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.5041v2,"physics.ed-ph, physics.pop-ph, PACS Codes 01.40.-d 01.80.+b 45.20.-d 45. 40.-f"
Interplay of energy dependent astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios and   new physics effects,"Poonam Mehta, Walter Winter","We discuss the importance of flavor ratio measurements in neutrino telescopes, such as by measuring the ratio between muon tracks to cascades, for the purpose of extracting new physics signals encountered by astrophysical neutrinos during propagation from the source to the detector. The detected flavor ratios not only carry the energy information of specific new physics scenarios which alter the transition probabilities in distinctive ways, but also the energy dependent flavor composition at the source. In the present work, we discuss the interplay of these two energy dependent effects and identify which new physics scenarios can be distinguished from the detected flavor ratios as a function of astrophysical parameters. We use a recently developed self-consistent neutrino production model as our toy model to generate energy dependent source flavor ratios and discuss (invisible) neutrino decay and quantum decoherence as specific new physics examples. Furthermore, we identify potentially interesting classes of sources on the Hillas plot for the purpose of new physics searches. We find that sources with substantial magnetic fields 10^3 Gauss <= B <= 10^6 Gauss, such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) cores, white dwarfs, or maybe gamma-ray bursts, have, in principle, the best discrimination power for the considered new physics scenarios, whereas AGN jets, which typically perform as pion beam sources, can only discriminate few sub cases in the new physics effects.

On a microscopic representation of spacetime,Rolf Dahm,"We start from a noncompact Lie algebra isomorphic to the Dirac algebra and relate this Lie algebra in a brief review to low energy hadron physics described by the compact group SU(4). This step permits an overall physical identification of the operator actions. Then we discuss the geometrical origin of this noncompact Lie algebra and 'reduce' the geometry in order to introduce in each of these steps coordinate definitions which can be related to an algebraic representation in terms of the spontaneous symmetry breakdown along the Lie algebra chain su*(4) $\longrightarrow$ usp(4) $\longrightarrow$ su(2)$\times$u(1). Standard techniques of Lie algebra decomposition(s) as well as the (physical) operator identification give rise to interesting physical aspects and lead to a rank-1 Riemannian space which provides an analytic representation and leads to a 5-dimensional hyperbolic space $H_{5}$ with SO(5,1) isometries. The action of the (compact) symplectic group decomposes this (globally) hyperbolic space into $H_{2}\oplus H_{3}$ with SO(2,1) and SO(3,1) isometries, respectively, which we relate to electromagnetic (dynamically broken SU(2) isospin) and Lorentz transformations.

Lessons for new physics from CKM studies,"Jack Laiho, Enrico Lunghi, Ruth Van De Water","We perform a global fit to the CKM unitarity triangle using the latest experimental and theoretical constraints. We present results for three different sets of constraints: the standard inputs used by CKMfitter and UTFit, the standard inputs minus |Vub|, and the standard inputs minus both |Vub| and |Vcb|. For the required nonperturbative weak matrix elements, we use three-flavor lattice QCD averages from www.latticeaverages.org; these have been updated to reflect all available lattice calculations as of the ""End of 2010"". Given current theoretical and experimental inputs, we observe an approximately 3{\sigma} tension in the CKM unitarity triangle that can be interpreted as sign of physics beyond the standard model in the flavor sector. Using a model-independent parameterization of new physics effects, we test the compatibility of new physics in kaon mixing, in B-mixing, or in B \rightarrow {\tau} {\nu} decay with the current data. Although the tension could be accommodated with each hypothesis, the scenarios with new physics in B-mixing or, to a lesser extent, in B \rightarrow {\tau} {\nu} decay are strongly preferred. Finally, we interpret these results in terms contributions to \Delta S = 2 and \Delta B = 2 four-fermion operators.

A high-luminosity high-energy e+e- collider allows for the exploration of Standard Model physics, such as precise measurements of the Higgs, top and gauge sectors, as well as for a multitude of searches for New Physics, either through direct discovery or indirectly, via high-precision observables. Given the current state of knowledge, following the observation of a \sim125 GeV Higgs-like particle at the LHC, and pending further LHC results at 8 TeV and 14 TeV, a linear e+e- collider built and operated in centre-of-mass energy stages from a few-hundred GeV up to a few TeV will be an ideal physics exploration tool, complementing the LHC. Two example scenarios are presented for a CLIC accelerator built in three main stages of 500 GeV, 1.4 (1.5) TeV, and 3 TeV, together with the layout and performance of the experiments and accompanied by cost estimates. The resulting CLIC physics potential and measurement precisions are illustrated through detector simulations under realistic beam conditions.",2012-08-07T11:48:55Z,2012-08-07T11:48:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1402v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.1402v1,"physics.acc-ph, hep-ex, hep-ph, physics.ins-det"
Physics Educators as Designers of Simulation using Easy Java Simulation   (Ejs) Part 2*,Loo Kang Wee,"To deepen do-it-yourself (DIY) technology in the physics classroom, we seek to highlight the Open Source Physics (OSP) community of educators that engage, enable and empower teachers as learners so that we create DIY technology tools-simulation for inquiry learning. We learn through Web 2 online collaborative means to develop simulations together with reputable physicists through the open source digital library. By examining the open source codes of the simulation through the Easy Java Simulation (EJS) toolkit, we are able make sense of the physics from the computational models created by practicing physicists. We will share newer (2010-present) simulations that we have remixed from existing library of simulations models into suitable learning environments for inquiry of physics. We hope other teachers would find these simulations useful and remix them that suit their own context and contribute back to benefit all humankind, becoming citizens for the world.

The Full $B \to D^{*} τ^{-} \bar{ν_τ}$ Angular Distribution and   CP violating Triple Products,"Murugeswaran Duraisamy, Alakabha Datta","We perform a comprehensive study of the impact of new-physics operators with different Lorentz structures on $\BDstarellnu$ decays, $(\ell = e, \mu, \tau $) involving the $b \to c l \nu_\ell$ transition. We present the full three angle and $q^2$ angular distribution with new physics operators with complex couplings. Various observables are constructed from the angular distribution with special focus on the CP violating triple product asymmetries which vanish in the Standard Model without any hadronic complications. Two of the three triple products are only sensitive to vector/axial vector new physics operators. %and do not depend on pseudoscalar new physics. Hence, the measurements of non-zero triple-product asymmetries will be a clear sign of new physics and a strong signal for vector/axial vector new physics operators. Even though we focus on $\tau$ final state, one can use the triple-products to search for new physics with $e$ and $\mu$ in the final state.",2013-02-27T23:35:52Z,2013-11-02T06:02:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7031v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.7031v6,"hep-ph, hep-ex"
New Physics Signatures in Kaon Decays,Monika Blanke,"Kaon physics provides a unique opportunity to identify new flavour and CP violating interactions beyond the Standard Model (SM). In the SM, implied by the hierarchical structure of the CKM matrix and the GIM mechanism, flavour changing neutral current processes are most strongly suppressed in the kaon sector while the suppression is much less effective in the B meson systems. Thus their theoretical cleanness makes rare K decays, in particular the K -> pi nu anti-nu system, extremely well suited to look for deviations from their tiny SM values. Despite the increasingly stringent constraints on new physics from direct search experiments as well as indirect searches in B meson decays, large enhancements of both K^+ -> pi^+ nu anti-nu and K_L -> pi^0 nu anti-nu are still possible, and deviations from the SM could be observed even for a multi-TeV new physics scale. In addition the correlation betweeen the charged and neutral K -> pi nu anti-nu modes provides insight on the new physics operator structure in K^0 - anti-K^0 mixing and its interplay with rare K decays. Useful model-discriminating correlations exist also in the K_L -> pi^0 l^+ l^- system. Finally the K -> l nu decays provide a clean test of lepton universality and place constraints on new physics complementary to the ones obtained from the searches for charged lepton flavour violating decays.",2013-05-24T09:53:54Z,2013-05-24T09:53:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5671v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5671v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex, hep-lat"
Terrace-like structure in the above-threshold ionization spectrum of an   atom in an IR+XUV two-color laser field,"Kui Zhang, Jing Chen, Panming Fu, Zong-Chao Yan, Bingbing Wang","Based on the frequency-domain theory, we investigate the above-threshold ionization (ATI) process of an atom in a two-color laser field with infrared (IR) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) frequencies, where the photon energy of the XUV laser is close to or larger than the atomic ionization threshold. By using the channel analysis, we find that the two laser fields play different roles in an ionization process, where the XUV laser determines the ionization probability by the photon number that the atom absorbs from it, while the IR laser accelerates the ionized electron and hence widens the electron kinetic energy spectrum. As a result, the ATI spectrum presents a terrace-like structure. By using the saddle-point approximation, we obtain a classical formula which can predict the cutoff of each plateau in the terrace-like ATI spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the difference of the heights between two neighboring plateaus in the terrace-like structure of the ATI spectrum increases as the frequency of the XUV laser increases.",2013-08-14T08:50:22Z,2013-08-14T08:50:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3062v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3062v1,physics.atom-ph
"Future sensitivity to new physics in B_d, B_s and K mixings","Jerome Charles, Sebastien Descotes-Genon, Zoltan Ligeti, Stephane Monteil, Michele Papucci, Karim Trabelsi","We estimate, in a large class of scenarios, the sensitivity to new physics in B_d and B_s mixings achievable with 50 ab-1 of Belle II and 50 fb-1 of LHCb data. We find that current limits on new physics contributions in both B_{d,s} systems can be improved by a factor of ~5 for all values of the CP violating phases, corresponding to over a factor of 2 increase in the scale of new physics probed. Assuming the same suppressions by CKM matrix elements as those of the standard model box diagrams, the scale probed will be about 20 TeV for tree-level new physics contributions, and about 2 TeV for new physics arising at one-loop. We also explore the future sensitivity to new physics in K mixing. Implications for generic new physics and for various specific scenarios, such as minimal flavor violation, light third-generation dominated flavor violation, or U(2) flavor models are studied.",2013-09-09T20:00:07Z,2014-02-27T23:40:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2293v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2293v3,hep-ph
Quantum Gravity: physics from supergeometries,"Diego Julio Cirilo-Lombardo, Thiago Prudencio","We show that the metric (line element) is the first geometrical object to be associated to a discrete (quantum) structure of the spacetime without necessity of black hole-entropy-area arguments, in sharp contrast with other attempts in the literature. To this end, an emergent metric solution obtained previously in [Physics Letters B 661, 186-191 (2008)] from a particular non-degenerate Riemmanian superspace is introduced. This emergent metric is described by a physical coherent state belonging to the metaplectic group Mp (n) with a Poissonian distribution at lower n (number basis) restoring the classical thermal continuum behaviour at large n (n ! 1), or leading to non-classical radiation states, as is conjectured in a quite general basis by mean the Bekenstein- Mukhanov effect.

On the physical inconsistency of a new statistical scaling symmetry in   incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence,"Michael Frewer, George Khujadze, Holger Foysi","A detailed theoretical investigation is given which demonstrates that a recently proposed statistical scaling symmetry is physically void. Although this scaling is mathematically admitted as a unique symmetry transformation by the underlying statistical equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence on the level of the functional Hopf equation, by closer inspection, however, it leads to physical inconsistencies and erroneous conclusions in the theory of turbulence. The new statistical symmetry is thus misleading in so far as it forms within an unmodelled theory an analytical result which at the same time lacks physical consistency. Our investigation will expose this inconsistency on different levels of statistical description, where on each level we will gain new insights for its non-physical transformation behavior. With a view to generate invariant turbulent scaling laws, the consequences will be finally discussed when trying to analytically exploit such a symmetry. In fact, a mismatch between theory and numerical experiment is conclusively quantified. We ultimately propose a general strategy on how to not only track unphysical statistical symmetries, but also on how to avoid generating such misleading invariance results from the outset. All the more so as this specific study on a physically inconsistent scaling symmetry only serves as a representative example within the broader context of statistical invariance analysis. In this sense our investigation is applicable to all areas of statistical physics in which symmetries get determined in order to either characterize complex dynamical systems, or in order to extract physically useful and meaningful information from the underlying dynamical process itself.",2014-12-06T15:19:40Z,2016-10-10T16:02:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3061v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3061v2,"physics.flu-dyn, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"
Recoverability in quantum information theory,Mark M. Wilde,"The fact that the quantum relative entropy is non-increasing with respect to quantum physical evolutions lies at the core of many optimality theorems in quantum information theory and has applications in other areas of physics. In this work, we establish improvements of this entropy inequality in the form of physically meaningful remainder terms. One of the main results can be summarized informally as follows: if the decrease in quantum relative entropy between two quantum states after a quantum physical evolution is relatively small, then it is possible to perform a recovery operation, such that one can perfectly recover one state while approximately recovering the other. This can be interpreted as quantifying how well one can reverse a quantum physical evolution. Our proof method is elementary, relying on the method of complex interpolation, basic linear algebra, and the recently introduced Renyi generalization of a relative entropy difference. The theorem has a number of applications in quantum information theory, which have to do with providing physically meaningful improvements to many known entropy inequalities.",2015-05-18T14:36:26Z,2015-06-19T07:04:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04661v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04661v5,"quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.IT, hep-th, math-ph, math.IT, math.MP"
Identifying Differences In Diagnostic Skills Between Physics Students:   Developing A Rubric,"Andrew Mason, Elisheva Cohen, Edit Yerushalmi, Chandralekha Singh","Expert problem solvers are characterized by continuous evaluation of their progress towards a solution. One characteristic of expertise is self-diagnosis directed towards elaboration of the solvers' conceptual understanding, knowledge organization or strategic approach. ""Self-diagnosis tasks"" aim at fostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly requiring students to present diagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing their problem solutions. We have been investigating how introductory physics students perform in such tasks. Developing a robust rubric is essential for objective evaluation of students' self-diagnosis skills. We discuss the development of a grading rubric that takes into account introductory physics students' content knowledge as well as analysis, planning and presentation skills. Using this rubric, we have found the inter-rater reliability to be better than 80%. The rubric can easily be adapted to other problems, as will be discussed in a companion paper.",2016-03-10T00:00:20Z,2016-03-10T00:00:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03103v1,physics.ed-ph
Cutting Feynman Loops in Ultrastrong Cavity QED: Stimulated Emission and   Reabsorption of Virtual Particles Dressing a Physical Excitation,"Omar Di Stefano, Roberto Stassi, Luigi Garziano, Anton Frisk Kockum, Salvatore Savasta, Franco Nori","In quantum field theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realized in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.",2016-03-16T07:50:45Z,2016-03-16T07:50:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04984v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04984v1,quant-ph
A Quantum Space Behind Simple Quantum Mechanics,"Chuan Sheng Chew, Otto C. W. Kong, Jason Payne","In physics, experiments ultimately inform us as to what constitutes a good theoretical model of any physical concept: physical space should be no exception. The best picture of physical space in Newtonian physics is given by the configuration space of a free particle (or the center of mass of a closed system of particles). This configuration space (as well as phase space), can be constructed as a representation space for the relativity symmetry. From the corresponding quantum symmetry, we illustrate the construction of a quantum configuration space, similar to that of quantum phase space, and recover the classical picture as an approximation through a contraction of the (relativity) symmetry and its representations. The quantum Hilbert space reduces into a sum of one-dimensional representations for the observable algebra, with the only admissible states given by coherent states and position eigenstates for the phase and configuration space pictures, respectively. This analysis, founded firmly on known physics, provides a quantum picture of physical space beyond that of a finite-dimensional manifold, and provides a crucial first link for any theoretical model of quantum spacetime at levels beyond simple quantum mechanics. It also suggests looking at quantum physics from a different perspective.",2016-03-17T06:53:49Z,2017-09-13T07:12:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05371v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05371v4,"quant-ph, gr-qc"
Irreversibility in physics stemming from unpredictable symbol-handling   agents,"John M. Myers, F. Hadi Madjid","The basic equations of physics involve a time variable t and are invariant under the transformation $t goes to -t$. This invariance at first sight appears to impose time reversibility as a principle of physics, in conflict with thermodynamics. But equations written on the blackboard are not the whole story in physics. In prior work we sharpened a distinction obscured in today's theoretical physics, the distinction between obtaining evidence from experiments on the laboratory bench and explaining that evidence in mathematical symbols on the blackboard. The sharp distinction rests on a proof within the mathematics of quantum theory that no amount of evidence, represented in quantum theory in terms of probabilities, can uniquely determine its explanation in terms of wave functions and linear operators. Building on the proof we show here a role in physics for unpredictable symbol-handling agents acting both at the blackboard and at the workbench, communicating back and forth by means of transmitted symbols. Because of their unpredictability, symbol-handling agents introduce a heretofore overlooked source of irreversibility into physics, even when the equations they write on the blackboard are invariant under t goes to -t$. Widening the scope of descriptions admissible to physics to include the agents and the symbols that link theory to experiments opens up a new source of time-irreversibility in physics.",2016-04-22T18:49:06Z,2016-04-22T18:49:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06771v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06771v1,quant-ph
Designing Quantum Information Processing via Structural Physical   Approximation,Joonwoo Bae,"In quantum information processing it may be possible to have efficient computation and secure communication beyond the limitations of classical systems. In a fundamental point of view, however, evolution of quantum systems by the laws of quantum mechanics is more restrictive than classical systems, identified to a specific form of dynamics, that is, unitary transformations and, consequently, positive and completely positive maps to subsystems. This also characterizes classes of disallowed transformations on quantum systems, among which positive but not completely maps are of particular interest as they characterize entangled states, a general resource in quantum information processing. Structural physical approximation offers a systematic way of approximating those non-physical maps, positive but not completely positive maps, with quantum channels. Since it has been proposed as a method of detecting entangled states, it has stimulated fundamental problems on classifications of positive maps and the structure of Hermitian operators and quantum states, as well as on quantum measurement such as quantum design in quantum information theory. It has developed efficient and feasible methods of directly detecting entangled states in practice, for which proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations have also been performed with photonic qubit states. Here, we present a comprehensive review on quantum information processing with structural physical approximations and the related progress. The review mainly focuses on properties of structural physical approximations and their applications toward practical information applications.",2017-07-09T14:02:51Z,2017-07-09T14:02:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02583v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02583v1,quant-ph
Recent CMS results in top and Higgs physics,Rebeca Gonzalez Suarez,"After the Higgs boson discovery in 2012, the investigation of its properties and compatibility with the standard model predictions is central to the physics program of the LHC experiments. Likewise, the study of the top quark is still relevant at the LHC, more than two decades after its discovery at the Tevatron. Top quarks and Higgs bosons are produced at the LHC on a large scale and share a deep connection based on the large mass of the top quark. Both particles provide an excellent laboratory in which to search for new physics: the measurement of their properties tests the foundations of the standard model; and they feature prominently in a variety of exotic signals. The coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark, a fundamental standard model parameter, can only be measured directly in processes where the two particles are produced together. The production of a Higgs boson together with one or two top quarks is also sensitive to several exciting new physics effects.

Blending physical knowledge with mathematical form in physics problem   solving,"Mark Eichenlaub, Edward F. Redish","Equations are about more than computing physical quantities or constructing formal models; they are also about understanding. The conceptual systems physicists use to think about nature are made from many different resources, formal and not, working together and inextricably linked. By blending mathematical forms and physical intuition, physicists breathe meaning into the equations they use. In contrast, in physics class, novice students often treat mathematics as only a calculational tool, isolating it from their rich knowledge of the physical world. We are interested in cases where students break that pattern by reading, manipulating, and building equations meaningfully rather than purely formally. To find examples of this and explore the diversity of ways students combine formal and intuitive resources, we conducted problem-solving interviews with students in an introductory physics for life sciences class. During the interviews, we scaffolded student use of strategies which call for both formal and intuitive reasoning, such as ""examine the extreme cases"". We use the analytic framework of epistemic games to model how students used the strategies and how they accessed problem-solving resources, and we present evidence that novice students using these strategies accessed more expert-like conceptual systems than those typically described in problem-solving literature. They blended physical intuition with mathematical symbolic templates, reconceptualized the nature of equations, and distinguished similar functional forms. Once introduced to a strategy, students applied it to new scenarios and found new types of uses for it, acknowledging it as a useful, general purpose problem-solving technique. Our data suggests that these strategies can potentially help novice students learn to develop and apply their physical intuition more effectively.",2018-04-05T01:02:46Z,2018-04-05T01:02:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01639v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01639v1,physics.ed-ph
"The Modeling Framework for Experimental Physics: Description,   development, and applications","Dimitri R. Dounas-Frazer, H. J.

However, most have limited applicability to the context of upper-division physics lab courses or experimental physics. Here, we discuss the Modeling Framework for Experimental Physics, a theoretical framework tailored to labs and experimentation. A key feature of the Framework is recursive interaction between models and apparatus. Models are revised to account for new evidence produced by apparatus, and apparatus are revised to better align with the simplifying assumptions of models. Another key feature is the distinction between the physical phenomenon being investigated and the measurement equipment used to conduct the investigation. Models of physical systems facilitate explanation or prediction of phenomena, whereas models of measurement systems facilitate interpretation of data. We describe the Framework, provide a chronological history of its development, and summarize its applications to research and curricular design. Ultimately, we argue that the Modeling Framework is a theoretically sound and well-tested tool that is applicable to multiple physics domains and research purposes.

Combining Coarse and Fine Physics for Manipulation using   Parallel-in-Time Integration,"Wisdom C. Agboh, Daniel Ruprecht, Mehmet R. Dogar","We present a method for fast and accurate physics-based predictions during non-prehensile manipulation planning and control. Given an initial state and a sequence of controls, the problem of predicting the resulting sequence of states is a key component of a variety of model-based planning and control algorithms. We propose combining a coarse (i.e. computationally cheap but not very accurate) predictive physics model, with a fine (i.e. computationally expensive but accurate) predictive physics model, to generate a hybrid model that is at the required speed and accuracy for a given manipulation task. Our approach is based on the Parareal algorithm, a parallel-in-time integration method used for computing numerical solutions for general systems of ordinary differential equations. We adapt Parareal to combine a coarse pushing model with an off-the-shelf physics engine to deliver physics-based predictions that are as accurate as the physics engine but run in substantially less wall-clock time, thanks to parallelization across time. We use these physics-based predictions in a model-predictive-control framework based on trajectory optimization, to plan pushing actions that avoid an obstacle and reach a goal location. We show that with hybrid physics models, we can achieve the same success rates as the planner that uses the off-the-shelf physics engine directly, but significantly faster.

PhysPort use and growth: Supporting physics teaching with research-based   resources since 2011,"Sarah B. McKagan, Linda E. Strubbe, Lyle J. Barbato, Adrian M. Madsen, Eleanor C. Sayre, Bruce A.

A Combined Data-driven and Physics-driven Method for Steady Heat   Conduction Prediction using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Hao Ma, Xiangyu Hu, Yuxuan Zhang, Nils Thuerey, Oskar J. Haidn","With several advantages and as an alternative to predict physics field, machine learning methods can be classified into two distinct types: data-driven relying on training data and physics-driven using physics law. Choosing heat conduction problem as an example, we compared the data- and physics-driven learning process with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It shows that the convergences of the error to ground truth solution and the residual of heat conduction equation exhibit remarkable differences. Based on this observation, we propose a combined-driven method for learning acceleration and more accurate solutions. With a weighted loss function, reference data and physical equation are able to simultaneously drive the learning. Several numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the combined method. For the data-driven based method, the introduction of physical equation not only is able to speed up the convergence, but also produces physically more consistent solutions.

Interviews with female students suggest that instructors should be careful not to give unintended messages to students, e.g., by praising some students for brilliance or intelligence as opposed to their effort because praising a student for brilliance can convey to other students that they do not have what is required to excel in physics. Interviews also suggest that when students ask instructors for help on physics problems, if instructors inadvertently label those problems as ""easy"", ""trivial"" or ""obvious"", it can also make students feel disparaged. The perception of being belittled by these kinds of unintended comments by instructors as well as a lack of positive recognition for good effort and progress have the potential to most adversely impact students from underrepresented groups including women.",2020-07-15T02:25:35Z,2020-07-15T02:25:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07440v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07440v1,physics.ed-ph
New Physics in $b\to s\ell\ell$ anomalies and its implications for the   complementary neutral current decays,"Faisal Munir Bhutta, Zhuo-Ran Huang, Cai-Dian Lü, M. Ali Paracha, Wenyu Wang","We study the Standard Model and the new physics predictions for the lepton-flavour-universality violating (LFUV) ratios in various $b\to s \ell^+\ell^-$ channels with scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and $\Lambda$ baryon final states, considering both unpolarized and polarized final state hadrons. In order to formulate physical observables, we use the model independent effective Hamiltonian approach and employ the helicity formalism. We provide the explicit expressions of the helicity amplitudes in terms of the Wilson coefficients and the hadronic form factors by using the same kinematical configuration and polarization conventions for all the decay channels.We perform the numerical analysis with new physics scenarios selected from the recent global fits to $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data, having specific new physics model interpretations. We find that some of the LFUV ratios for these complementary channels in different kinematical regions have high sensitivity to new physics and the future measurements of them in Belle II and LHCb experiments, along with testing new physics/LFUV, can help to distinguish among some of the different new physics possibilities.",2020-09-08T09:00:39Z,2022-03-30T08:02:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03588v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03588v3,"hep-ph, hep-ex"
Identification of state functions by physically-guided neural networks   with physically-meaningful internal layers,"Jacobo Ayensa-Jiménez, Mohamed H. Doweidar, Jose Antonio Sanz-Herrera, Manuel Doblaré","Substitution of well-grounded theoretical models by data-driven predictions is not as simple in engineering and sciences as it is in social and economic fields. Scientific problems suffer most times from paucity of data, while they may involve a large number of variables and parameters that interact in complex and non-stationary ways, obeying certain physical laws. Moreover, a physically-based model is not only useful for making predictions, but to gain knowledge by the interpretation of its structure, parameters, and mathematical properties. The solution to these shortcomings seems to be the seamless blending of the tremendous predictive power of the data-driven approach with the scientific consistency and interpretability of physically-based models. We use here the concept of physically-constrained neural networks (PCNN) to predict the input-output relation in a physical system, while, at the same time fulfilling the physical constraints. With this goal, the internal hidden state variables of the system are associated with a set of internal neuron layers, whose values are constrained by known physical relations, as well as any additional knowledge on the system. Furthermore, when having enough data, it is possible to infer knowledge about the internal structure of the system and, if parameterized, to predict the state parameters for a particular input-output relation. We show that this approach, besides getting physically-based predictions, accelerates the training process, reduces the amount of data required to get similar accuracy, filters partly the intrinsic noise in the experimental data and provides improved extrapolation capacity.",2020-11-17T11:26:37Z,2020-11-17T11:26:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08567v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08567v1,"cs.LG, 68T07, I.2.7"
Phy-Q as a measure for physical reasoning intelligence,"Cheng Xue, Vimukthini Pinto, Chathura Gamage, Ekaterina Nikonova, Peng Zhang, Jochen Renz","Humans are well-versed in reasoning about the behaviors of physical objects and choosing actions accordingly to accomplish tasks, while it remains a major challenge for AI. To facilitate research addressing this problem, we propose a new testbed that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios and take an action appropriately. Inspired by the physical knowledge acquired in infancy and the capabilities required for robots to operate in real-world environments, we identify 15 essential physical scenarios. We create a wide variety of distinct task templates, and we ensure all the task templates within the same scenario can be solved by using one specific strategic physical rule. By having such a design, we evaluate two distinct levels of generalization, namely the local generalization and the broad generalization. We conduct an extensive evaluation with human players, learning agents with varying input types and architectures, and heuristic agents with different strategies. Inspired by how human IQ is calculated, we define the physical reasoning quotient (Phy-Q score) that reflects the physical reasoning intelligence of an agent using the physical scenarios we considered. Our evaluation shows that 1) all agents are far below human performance, and 2) learning agents, even with good local generalization ability, struggle to learn the underlying physical reasoning rules and fail to generalize broadly. We encourage the development of intelligent agents that can reach the human level Phy-Q score.

"Language of physics, language of math: Disciplinary culture and dynamic   epistemology","Edward F. Redish, Eric Kuo","Mathematics is a critical part of much scientific research. Physics in particular weaves math extensively into its instruction beginning in high school. Despite much research on the learning of both physics and math, the problem of how to effectively include math in physics in a way that reaches most students remains unsolved. In this paper, we suggest that a fundamental issue has received insufficient exploration: the fact that in science, we don't just use math, we make meaning with it in a different way than mathematicians do. In this reflective essay, we explore math as a language and consider the language of math in physics through the lens of cognitive linguistics. We begin by offering a number of examples that show how the use of math in physics differs from the use of math as typically found in math classes. We then explore basic concepts in cognitive semantics to show how humans make meaning with language in general. The critical elements are the roles of embodied cognition and interpretation in context. Then we show how a theoretical framework commonly used in physics education research, resources, is coherent with and extends the ideas of cognitive semantics by connecting embodiment to phenomenological primitives and contextual interpretation to the dynamics of meaning making with conceptual resources, epistemological resources, and affect. We present these ideas with illustrative case studies of students working on physics problems with math and demonstrate the dynamical nature of student reasoning with math in physics.

Universal few-body physics and cluster formation,"Chris H. Greene, P. Giannakeas, J. Perez-Rios","A recent rejuvenation of experimental and theoretical interest in the physics of few- body systems has provided deep, fundamental insights into a broad range of problems. Few-body physics is a cross-cutting discipline not restricted to conventional subject ar- eas such as nuclear physics or atomic or molecular physics. To a large degree, the recent explosion of interest in this subject has been sparked by dramatic enhancements of experimental capabilities in ultracold atomic systems over the past decade, which now permit atoms and molecules to be explored deep in the quantum mechanical limit with controllable two-body interactions. This control, typically enabled by magnetic or electromagnetically-dressed Fano-Feshbach resonances, allows in particular access to the range of universal few-body physics, where two-body scattering lengths far exceed all other length scales in the problem. The Efimov effect, where 3 particles experienc- ing short-range interactions can counterintuitively exhibit an infinite number of bound or quasi-bound energy levels, is the most famous example of universality. Tremendous progress in the field of universal Efimov physics has taken off, driven particularly by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies in the past decade, and prior to the first observation in 2006, by an extensive set of theoretical studies dating back to 1970. Because experimental observations of Efimov physics have usually relied on resonances or interference phenomena in three-body recombination, this connects naturally with the processes of molecule formation in a low temperature gas of atoms or nucleons, and more generally with N-body recombination processes. Some other topics not closely related to the Efimov effect are also reviewed in this article, including ...",2017-04-06T21:41:09Z,2017-04-06T21:41:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02029v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02029v1,"cond-mat.quant-gas, nucl-th, physics.atm-clus, physics.atom-ph"
First Draft on the xInf Model for Universal Physical Computation and   Reverse Engineering of Natural Intelligence,Hongbo Jia,"Turing Machines are universal computing machines in theory. It has been a long debate whether Turing Machines can simulate the consciousness mind behaviors in the materialistic universe. Three different hypotheses come out of such debate, in short:(A) Can; (B) Cannot; (C) Super-Turing machines can. Because Turing Machines or other kinds of theoretical computing models are abstract objects while behaviors are real observables, this debate involves at least three distinct fields of science and technology: physics, computer engineering, and experimental neuroscience. However, the languages used in these different fields are highly heterogeneous and not easily interpretable for each other, making it very difficult to reach partial agreements regarding this debate, Therefore, the main goal of this manuscript is to establish a proper language that can translate among those different fields. First, I propose a theoretical model for analyzing how theoretical computing machines would physically run in physical time. This model, termed as the xInf, is at first place Turing-complete in theory, and depending on the properties of physical time, it can be either Turing-equivalent or Super-Turing in the physical universe. The xInf Model is demonstrated to be a suitable universal language to translate among physics, computer engineering, and neuroscience. Finally, I propose a conjecture that there exists a Minimal Complete Set of rules in the xInf Model that enables the construction of a physical machine using inorganic materials that can pass the Turing Test in physical time. I cannot demonstrate whether such a conjecture to be testified or falsified on paper using finite-order logic, my only solution is physical time itself, i.e. an evolutionary competition will eventually tell the conclusion.",2017-12-26T23:36:43Z,2017-12-26T23:36:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.10280v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.10280v1,"q-bio.NC, cs.AI"
Comparing introductory physics and astronomy students' attitudes and   approaches to problem solving,"Melanie Good, Andrew Mason, Chandralekha Singh","We examined how introductory physics students' attitudes and approaches to problem solving compare to those of introductory astronomy students, using a previously validated survey, the Attitudes and Approaches to Problem Solving (AAPS) survey. In addition, we compared the performance of the introductory physics and astronomy students on the factors which were identified in a factor analysis in the original validation study. We found that introductory astronomy students' overall average AAPS score was significantly more favorable than that of introductory physics students (p < 0.01), and the effect size was large (Cohen's d = 0.81). We also found that introductory astronomy students' scores were more favorable in all clusters of questions except for one factor involving drawing diagrams and writing scratchwork while solving problems. We also found that introductory physics and astronomy students were equally capable of solving two isomorphic problems posed to them, and that the majority of introductory physics and introductory astronomy students reported that the problem posed in the astronomy context was more interesting to them. Interviews suggest that the context of astronomy in problem solving may be more interesting for students and could be one possible explanation for the more favorable AAPS scores amongst introductory astronomy students compared to introductory physics students. Instructors of introductory physics courses should heed these findings which indicate that it may be beneficial for instructors of introductory physics courses to incorporate problems into their instruction which contain real-world contexts, which may serve to increase student interest-level, and which could help create more favorable attitudes and approaches towards problem solving.",2019-07-02T02:55:46Z,2019-07-02T02:55:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01134v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01134v1,physics.ed-ph
"Two Forms of Proximal Physical Geometry. Axioms, Sewing Regions   Together, Classes of Regions, Duality, and Parallel Fibre Bundles",J. F. Peters,"This paper introduces two proximal forms of Lenzen physical geometry, namely, an \emph{axiomatized strongly proximal physical geometry} that is built on simplicial complexes with the dualities and sewing operations derived from string geometry and an \emph{axiomatized descriptive proximal physical geometry} in which spatial regions are described based on their features and the descriptive proximities between regions. This is a computational proximity approach to a Lenzen geometry of physical space. In both forms of physical geometry, region is a primitive. Intuitively, a region is a set of connected subregions. The primitive in this geometry is \emph{region}, instead of \emph{point}. Each description of a region with $n$ features is a mapping from the region to a feature vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In the feature space, proximal physical geometry has the look and feel of either Euclidean, Riemannian, or non-Euclidean geometry, since we freely work with the relations between points in the feature space. The focus in these new forms of geometry is the relation between individual regions with their own distinctive features such as shape, area, perimeter and diameter and the relation between nonempty sets of regions. The axioms for physical geometry as well as the axioms for proximal physical geometry are given and illustrated. Results for parallel classes of regions, descriptive fibre bundles and BreMiller-Sloyer sheaves are given. In addition, a region-based Borsuk-Ulam Theorem as well as a Wired Friend Theorem are given in the context of both forms of physical geometry.",2016-08-10T13:50:17Z,2016-11-18T12:29:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06208v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06208v4,"math.GN, math.MG, 54E05, 68U05"

Go with the Flow: Perception-refined Physics Simulation,"Tom F. H. Runia, Kirill Gavrilyuk, Cees G. M. Snoek, Arnold W. M. Smeulders","For many of the physical phenomena around us, we have developed sophisticated models explaining their behavior. Nevertheless, inferring specifics from visual observations is challenging due to the high number of causally underlying physical parameters -- including material properties and external forces. This paper addresses the problem of inferring such latent physical properties from observations. Our solution is an iterative refinement procedure with simulation at its core. The algorithm gradually updates the physical model parameters by running a simulation of the observed phenomenon and comparing the current simulation to a real-world observation. The physical similarity is computed using an embedding function that maps physically similar examples to nearby points. As a tangible example, we concentrate on flags curling in the wind -- a seemingly simple phenomenon but physically highly involved. Based on its underlying physical model and visual manifestation, we propose an instantiation of the embedding function. For this mapping, modeled as a deep network, we introduce a spectral decomposition layer that decomposes a video volume into its temporal spectral power and corresponding frequencies.

A clear knowledge of the physics processes involved in the samples, including the types of processes and the number of processes in each type, is a great help to investigating signals and backgrounds.

New Stringy Physics beyond Quantum Mechanics from the Feynman Path   Integral,Donatello Dolce,"By investigating the Feynman Path Integral we prove that elementary quantum particle dynamics are directly associated to single compact (cyclic) world-line parameters, playing the role of the particles' internal clock, implicit in ordinary undulatory mechanics and indirectly observed for instance in Time Crystals. This allows us to formulate a novel purely four-dimensional stringy description of elementary particles as possible physics beyond quantum mechanics. The novelty of this approach is that quantum mechanics originates from a non-trivial compact nature of the minkowskian space-time. Our result is a further evidence in support of Elementary Cycles Theory (ECT), which in previous papers has been proven to be consistent with known physics from theoretical particle physics to condensed matter. Here we provide additional conceptual arguments in support to this novel unified scenario of quantum and relativistic physics, potentially deterministic, and fully falsifiable having no fine-tunable parameters. The first evidences of such new physics characterized by ultra-fast cyclic time dynamics will be observed by probing quantum phenomena with experimental time accuracy of the order of $10^{-21}$ $sec$. Considerations about the emergence of the arrow of time from the realm of pure, zero temperature, quantum physics governed by intrinsic time periodicity are also provided.

An equitable and effective approach to introductory mechanics,"Eric Burkholder, Shima Salehi, Sarah Sackeyfio, Nicel Mohamed-Hinds, Carl Wieman","Introductory mechanics (""physics 1"") is a critical gateway course for students desiring to pursue a STEM career. A major challenge with this course is that there is a large spread in the students' incoming physics preparation, and this level of preparation is strongly predictive of a students' performance. The level of incoming preparation is also largely determined by a student's educational privilege, and so this course can amplify inequities in K-12 education and provide a barrier to a STEM career for students from marginalized groups. Here, we present a novel introductory course design to address such equity challenges in physics 1. We designed the course based on the concept of deliberate practice to give students targeted, scaffolded, and repeated opportunities to engage in research-identified practices and decisions required for effective problem-solving. We used real-world problems, as they carry less resemblance to physics high school problems, and so even the students with the best high school physics instruction have little experience or skill in solving them. The students learned the physics content knowledge they needed in future courses, particularly in engineering, and their problem-solving skills improved substantially. Furthermore, the success in the course was not correlated with incoming physics preparation, in stark contrast to the outcomes from traditional physics 1 courses.

Student Representations of Computation in the Physics Community,"W. Brian Lane, Cortney Headley","Undergraduate physics education has greatly benefited from the introduction of computational activities. However, despite the benefits computation has delivered, we still lack a complete understanding of the computationally integrated learning experience from the student perspective. In particular, we are interested in investigating how students develop expert-like perceptions of computation as a practice within the professional physics community. To investigate this aspect of student development, we employ the Communities of Practice framework, which describes how students navigate through a professional community by appropriating the community's practices and goals as personally important. We introduce the construct of a COP-Model as a student's internal representation of a professional community that they develop as they navigate that community. We used this construct to formulate a set of research questions and semistructured interview protocols to explore how five physics students represent the use of computation in their mental models of the global physics community. We foreground these representations in the local academic community established by their instructors in three concurrent computationally integrated physics courses. We find that these students saw computation as a normal and valuable part of physics practice, identified benefits of using computation in alignment with the physics community, struggle with confidence with regards to computation, and demonstrate some expectations for computational proficiency that are misaligned with the physics community.

ALP-Pions generalized,"Triparno Bandyopadhyay, Subhajit Ghosh, Tuhin S. Roy","A light axion-like particle or an ALP not just gives rise to interesting and spectacular signals of new physics as final states in meson decays, it necessarily leaves tell-tale signatures in processes that involve standard model (SM) fields only (i.e., SM processes). These effects result in the violation of the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation, modified form factors, altered integrated and differential rates for various SM transitions etc. This suggests that in the presence of a low lying state, such as an ALP, extraction of masses, mixing angles, and form factors in an entirely data-driven way from meson-physics observables is a highly non-trivial exercise. However, once done correctly, these same observables may, in turn, provide important (indirect) bounds on ALP physics, which remain robust even in the limits where new physics effects conspire to weaken the bounds from direct searches. Starting with a generalized ALP-quark Lagrangian (where restrictions due to parity are removed) we demonstrate this approach by focussing on $K^+_{\ell_3}$ decays, where we derive (indirect) bounds on ALP physics using NA48/2 data and lattice results. We also find sum rules which not just show deviations in the presence of an ALP, but also give hints towards the specific nature of the ALP physics itself.",2021-12-24T22:08:36Z,2022-06-29T09:52:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13147v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13147v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex, hep-lat"
A Survey on Machine Learning Approaches for Modelling Intuitive Physics,"Jiafei Duan, Arijit Dasgupta, Jason Fischer, Cheston Tan","Research in cognitive science has provided extensive evidence of human cognitive ability in performing physical reasoning of objects from noisy perceptual inputs. Such a cognitive ability is commonly known as intuitive physics. With advancements in deep learning, there is an increasing interest in building intelligent systems that are capable of performing physical reasoning from a given scene for the purpose of building better AI systems. As a result, many contemporary approaches in modelling intuitive physics for machine cognition have been inspired by literature from cognitive science. Despite the wide range of work in physical reasoning for machine cognition, there is a scarcity of reviews that organize and group these deep learning approaches. Especially at the intersection of intuitive physics and artificial intelligence, there is a need to make sense of the diverse range of ideas and approaches. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances and techniques in intuitive physics-inspired deep learning approaches for physical reasoning.

Scalable algorithms for physics-informed neural and graph networks,"Khemraj Shukla, Mengjia Xu, Nathaniel Trask, George Em Karniadakis","Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising new approach for simulating complex physical and biological systems that are governed by complex multiscale processes for which some data are also available. In some instances, the objective is to discover part of the hidden physics from the available data, and PIML has been shown to be particularly effective for such problems for which conventional methods may fail. Unlike commercial machine learning where training of deep neural networks requires big data, in PIML big data are not available. Instead, we can train such networks from additional information obtained by employing the physical laws and evaluating them at random points in the space-time domain. Such physics-informed machine learning integrates multimodality and multifidelity data with mathematical models, and implements them using neural networks or graph networks. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) based primarily on feed-forward neural networks and automatic differentiation. For more complex systems or systems of systems and unstructured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) present some distinct advantages, and here we review how physics-informed learning can be accomplished with GNNs based on graph exterior calculus to construct differential operators; we refer to these architectures as physics-informed graph networks (PIGNs). We present representative examples for both forward and inverse problems and discuss what advances are needed to scale up PINNs, PIGNs and more broadly GNNs for large-scale engineering problems.",2022-05-16T15:46:11Z,2022-05-16T15:46:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08332v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08332v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC, math.AP, math.DS"
Looking forward to forward physics at the CERN's LHC,Luis A. Anchordoqui,"For decades, new physics searches in collider experiments have focused on the high-$p_T$ region. However, it has recently become evident that the LHC physics potential has not been fully exploited. To be specific, forward collisions, which produce particles along the beamline with enormous rates, have been almost completely ignored. For all practical purposes, these collisions are a treasure trove of physics, containing the highest-energy neutrinos ever produced by humans, as well as possible evidence for dark matter, light and weakly-coupled particles, and new forces. In the upcoming LHC Run 3 the ForwArd Search ExpeRiment (FASER) and its cousin FASER$\nu$ will extend the LHC's physics potential. A continuation of this forward physics program for the HL-LHC aims at the Forward Physics Facility (FPF), with larger scale experiments.

Self-Validated Physics-Embedding Network: A General Framework for   Inverse Modelling,"Ruiyuan Kang, Dimitrios C. Kyritsis, Panos Liatsis","Physics-based inverse modeling techniques are typically restricted to particular research fields, whereas popular machine-learning-based ones are too data-dependent to guarantee the physical compatibility of the solution. In this paper, Self-Validated Physics-Embedding Network (SVPEN), a general neural network framework for inverse modeling is proposed. As its name suggests, the embedded physical forward model ensures that any solution that successfully passes its validation is physically reasonable. SVPEN operates in two modes: (a) the inverse function mode offers rapid state estimation as conventional supervised learning, and (b) the optimization mode offers a way to iteratively correct estimations that fail the validation process. Furthermore, the optimization mode provides SVPEN with reconfigurability i.e., replacing components like neural networks, physical models, and error calculations at will to solve a series of distinct inverse problems without pretraining. More than ten case studies in two highly nonlinear and entirely distinct applications: molecular absorption spectroscopy and Turbofan cycle analysis, demonstrate the generality, physical reliability, and reconfigurability of SVPEN. More importantly, SVPEN offers a solid foundation to use existing physical models within the context of AI, so as to striking a balance between data-driven and physics-driven models.",2022-10-12T10:31:36Z,2023-01-17T06:48:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06071v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06071v3,"cs.NE, cs.SY, eess.SY, G1.6, I2.8, I6.7"
Self-consistent extraction of spectroscopic bounds on light new physics,"Cédric Delaunay, Jean-Philippe Karr, Teppei Kitahara, Jeroen C. J.

This is usually done under the assumption of the Standard Model~(SM) of particle physics. Allowing for light new physics~(NP) beyond the SM modifies the extraction of fundamental physical constants. Consequently, setting NP bounds using these data, and at the same time assuming the CODATA recommended values for the fundamental physical constants, is not reliable. As we show in this Letter, both SM and NP parameters can be simultaneously determined in a consistent way from a global fit. For light vectors with QED-like couplings, such as the dark photon, we provide a prescription that recovers the degeneracy with the photon in the massless limit, and requires calculations only at leading order in the small new physics couplings. At present, the data show tensions partially related to the proton charge radius determination. We show that these can be alleviated by including contributions from a light scalar with flavor non-universal couplings.",2022-10-18T18:00:00Z,2022-10-18T18:00:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10056v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10056v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex, physics.atom-ph"
Survey of physics reasoning on uncertainty concepts in experiments: an   assessment of measurement uncertainty for introductory physics labs,"Michael Vignal, Gayle Geschwind, Benjamin Pollard, Rachel Henderson, Marcos D. Caballero, H. J.

However, there has not been a broadly applicable, research-based assessment tool that allows physics instructors to easily measure students' knowledge of measurement uncertainty concepts and practices. To address this need, we employed Evidence-Centered Design to create the Survey of Physics Reasoning on Uncertainty Concepts in Experiments (SPRUCE). SPRUCE is a pre-post assessment instrument intended for use in introductory (first- and second-year) physics lab courses to help instructors and researchers identify student strengths and challenges with measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we discuss the development of SPRUCE's assessment items guided by Evidence-Centered Design, focusing on how instructors' and researchers' assessment priorities were incorporated into the assessment items and how students' reasoning from pilot testing informed decisions around item answer options.

Physics-Informed Computer Vision: A Review and Perspectives,"Chayan Banerjee, Kien Nguyen, Clinton Fookes, George Karniadakis","The incorporation of physical information in machine learning frameworks is opening and transforming many application domains. Here the learning process is augmented through the induction of fundamental knowledge and governing physical laws. In this work, we explore their utility for computer vision tasks in interpreting and understanding visual data. We present a systematic literature review of more than 250 papers on formulation and approaches to computer vision tasks guided by physical laws. We begin by decomposing the popular computer vision pipeline into a taxonomy of stages and investigate approaches to incorporate governing physical equations in each stage. Existing approaches in computer vision tasks are analyzed with regard to what governing physical processes are modeled and formulated, and how they are incorporated, i.e. modification of input data (observation bias), modification of network architectures (inductive bias), and modification of training losses (learning bias). The taxonomy offers a unified view of the application of the physics-informed capability, highlighting where physics-informed learning has been conducted and where the gaps and opportunities are. Finally, we highlight open problems and challenges to inform future research.

Viscosity and diffusion in life processes and tuning of fundamental   constants,K Trachenko,"Viewed as one of the grandest questions in modern science, understanding fundamental physical constants has been discussed in high-energy particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. Here, I review how condensed matter and liquid physics gives new insights into fundamental constants and their tuning. This is based on two observations: first, cellular life and the existence of observers depend on viscosity and diffusion. Second, the lower bound on viscosity and upper bound on diffusion are set by fundamental constants, and I briefly review this result and related recent developments in liquid physics. I will subsequently show that bounds on viscosity, diffusion and the newly introduced fundamental velocity gradient in a biochemical machine can all be varied while keeping the fine-structure constant and the proton-to-electron mass ratio intact. This implies that it is possible to produce heavy elements in stars but have a viscous planet where all liquids have very high viscosity (for example that of tar or higher) and where life may not exist. Knowing the range of bio-friendly viscosity and diffusion, we will be able to calculate the range of fundamental constants which favor cellular life and observers and compare this tuning with that discussed in high-energy physics previously. This invites an inter-disciplinary research between condensed matter physics and life sciences, and I formulate several questions that life science can address.

Physically Grounded Vision-Language Models for Robotic Manipulation,"Jensen Gao, Bidipta Sarkar, Fei Xia, Ted Xiao, Jiajun Wu, Brian Ichter, Anirudha Majumdar, Dorsa Sadigh","Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to improved performance on tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Consequently, these models are now well-positioned to reason about the physical world, particularly within domains such as robotic manipulation. However, current VLMs are limited in their understanding of the physical concepts (e.g., material, fragility) of common objects, which restricts their usefulness for robotic manipulation tasks that involve interaction and physical reasoning about such objects. To address this limitation, we propose PhysObjects, an object-centric dataset of 39.6K crowd-sourced and 417K automated physical concept annotations of common household objects. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a VLM on PhysObjects improves its understanding of physical object concepts, including generalization to held-out concepts, by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual appearance. We incorporate this physically grounded VLM in an interactive framework with a large language model-based robotic planner, and show improved planning performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts, compared to baselines that do not leverage physically grounded VLMs. We additionally illustrate the benefits of our physically grounded VLM on a real robot, where it improves task success rates.

Anomalies in Particle Physics,"Andreas Crivellin, Bruce Mellado","The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called ``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years. We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale (i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions. In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates.

Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes,"Jinmin Yi, Weicheng Ye, Daniel Gottesman, Zi-Wen Liu","We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) capability, two properties of fundamental importance to the physics and practical use of quantum many-body systems, covering systems with both all-to-all connectivity and geometric scenarios like lattice systems in finite spatial dimensions. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that, for a code encoding $k$ logical qubits in $n$ physical qubits, if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold, then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial ""phases"" of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding quantum complexity and order in many-body quantum systems, generating new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant ""scaling threshold"" of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.",2023-10-07T07:03:46Z,2024-09-19T14:12:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04710v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04710v3,"quant-ph, cond-mat.str-el, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"
Correcting model misspecification in physics-informed neural networks   (PINNs),"Zongren Zou, Xuhui Meng, George Em Karniadakis","Data-driven discovery of governing equations in computational science has emerged as a new paradigm for obtaining accurate physical models and as a possible alternative to theoretical derivations. The recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have also been employed to learn governing equations given data across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite the effectiveness of PINNs for discovering governing equations, the physical models encoded in PINNs may be misspecified in complex systems as some of the physical processes may not be fully understood, leading to the poor accuracy of PINN predictions. In this work, we present a general approach to correct the misspecified physical models in PINNs for discovering governing equations, given some sparse and/or noisy data. Specifically, we first encode the assumed physical models, which may be misspecified, then employ other deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the discrepancy between the imperfect models and the observational data. Due to the expressivity of DNNs, the proposed method is capable of reducing the computational errors caused by the model misspecification and thus enables the applications of PINNs in complex systems where the physical processes are not exactly known. Furthermore, we utilize the Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) and/or ensemble PINNs to quantify uncertainties arising from noisy and/or gappy data in the discovered governing equations. A series of numerical examples including non-Newtonian channel and cavity flows demonstrate that the added DNNs are capable of correcting the model misspecification in PINNs and thus reduce the discrepancy between the physical models and the observational data. We envision that the proposed approach will extend the applications of PINNs for discovering governing equations in problems where the physico-chemical or biological processes are not well understood.",2023-10-16T19:25:52Z,2023-10-16T19:25:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10776v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10776v1,"cs.LG, physics.comp-ph"
"Pregeometry, Formal Language and Constructivist Foundations of Physics","Xerxes D. Arsiwalla, Hatem Elshatlawy, Dean Rickles","How does one formalize the structure of structures necessary for the foundations of physics? This work is an attempt at conceptualizing the metaphysics of pregeometric structures, upon which new and existing notions of quantum geometry may find a foundation. We discuss the philosophy of pregeometric structures due to Wheeler, Leibniz as well as modern manifestations in topos theory. We draw attention to evidence suggesting that the framework of formal language, in particular, homotopy type theory, provides the conceptual building blocks for a theory of pregeometry. This work is largely a synthesis of ideas that serve as a precursor for conceptualizing the notion of space in physical theories. In particular, the approach we espouse is based on a constructivist philosophy, wherein ``structureless structures'' are syntactic types realizing formal proofs and programs. Spaces and algebras relevant to physical theories are modeled as type-theoretic routines constructed from compositional rules of a formal language. This offers the remarkable possibility of taxonomizing distinct notions of geometry using a common theoretical framework. In particular, this perspective addresses the crucial issue of how spatiality may be realized in models that link formal computation to physics, such as the Wolfram model.",2023-11-07T13:19:29Z,2023-11-07T13:19:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03973v1,"physics.hist-ph, gr-qc, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"
Amplification of genuine tripartite nonlocality and entanglement in the   Schwarzschild spacetime under decoherence,"Chunyao Liu, Zhengwen Long, Qiliang He","We investigate the amplification of the genuine tripartite nonlocality(GTN) and the genuine tripartite entanglement(GTE) of Dirac particles in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole by a local filtering operation under decoherence. It is shown that the physically accessible GTN will be completely destroyed by decoherence, which means that the physically accessible GTN will not exist in the system. Particularly, the local filtering operation can make the physically accessible GTN appear within a certain range of Hawking temperature, namely, the local filtering operation can cause the physically accessible GTN to be generated in the system coupled with the environment, which is not discovered before and is benefit for the quantum information processing. Furthermore, we also find that the physically accessible GTE approaches a stable value in the limit of infinite Hawking temperature for most cases, but if the decoherence parameter $p$ is less than 1, the ``sudden death'' of GTE will take place when the decoherence strength is large enough. It is worth noting that the nonzero stable value of GTE can be increased by performing the local filtering operation, even in the presence of decoherence. Finally, we explore the generation of physically inaccessible GTN and GTE of other tripartite subsystems under decoherence, it is shown that the physically inaccessible GTN cannot be produced, but the physically inaccessible GTE can be produced. In addition, we can see that the generated physically inaccessible GTE can be increased by applying the local filtering operation.",2024-01-09T08:02:10Z,2024-05-20T13:59:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04407v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04407v2,"quant-ph, gr-qc"
Framework and Classification of Indicator of Compromise for   physics-based attacks,Vincent Tan,"Quantum communications are based on the law of physics for information security and the implications for this form of future information security enabled by quantum science has to be studied. Physics-based vulnerabilities may exist due to the inherent physics properties and behavior of quantum technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), thus resulting in new threats that may emerge with attackers exploiting the physics-based vulnerabilities. There were many studies and experiments done to demonstrate the threat of physics-based attacks on quantum links. However, there is a lack of a framework that provides a common language to communicate about the threats and type of adversaries being dealt with for physics-based attacks. This paper is a review of physics-based attacks that were being investigated and attempt to initialize a framework based on the attack objectives and methodologies, referencing the concept from the well-established MITRE ATT&CK, therefore pioneering the classification of Indicator of Compromises (IoCs) for physics-based attacks.

On the well-posedness of inverse problems under information field   theory: application to model-form error detection,"Alex Alberts, Ilias Bilionis","We derive conditions in which inverse problems posed under an information field theory (IFT) framework have unique solutions. While the theorems here apply to IFT inverse problems in general, we place a special focus on the problem of identifying model-form error. Due to the continued increase in popularity of physics-informed methods, tools which can validate the form of the physics chosen under a physics-informed framework are desirable. Using IFT, we pose the problem of identifying model-form error as a Bayesian inverse problem. The IFT framework lets us define a physics-informed prior over fields, where a parameter, which we call the trust, measures our belief in the physical model by scaling the spread of this prior. In principle, smaller values of trust cause the prior to appear flat, representing a larger degree of uncertainty about the physics. To detect model-form error, we infer the trust as part of an inverse problem and study the limiting behavior. Using the Gaussian random field interpretation of IFT, we show how identifying the trust becomes a well-posed inverse problem. We provide an example where the physics are assumed to be the Poisson equation and study the effect of model-form error on the trust. We find that a correct model leads to infinite trust, and under model-form error, physics which are closer to the ground truth lead to larger values of the trust.",2024-01-25T15:05:22Z,2024-02-19T17:31:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14224v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14224v2,"math-ph, math.MP"
Three-dimensional shape and connectivity of physical networks,"Luka Blagojević, Márton Pósfai","Data describing the three-dimensional structure of physical networks is increasingly available, leading to a surge of interest in network science to explore the relationship between the shape and connectivity of physical networks. We contribute to this effort by standardizing and analyzing 15 data sets from different domains. Each network is made of tube-like objects bound together at junction points, which we treat as nodes, with the connections between them considered as links. We divide these networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. The degree distribution of these physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degrees one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors. The fact that the shape and connectivity of the physical networks are intertwined highlights that their three-dimensional layout must be taken into account to understand the evolution and function of physical networks.",2024-03-28T11:49:50Z,2024-08-19T07:38:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19333v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19333v3,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech"

Tenenbaum, Kaiming He, Wojciech Matusik","We present a computational framework that transforms single images into 3D physical objects. The visual geometry of a physical object in an image is determined by three orthogonal attributes: mechanical properties, external forces, and rest-shape geometry. Existing single-view 3D reconstruction methods often overlook this underlying composition, presuming rigidity or neglecting external forces. Consequently, the reconstructed objects fail to withstand real-world physical forces, resulting in instability or undesirable deformation -- diverging from their intended designs as depicted in the image. Our optimization framework addresses this by embedding physical compatibility into the reconstruction process. We explicitly decompose the three physical attributes and link them through static equilibrium, which serves as a hard constraint, ensuring that the optimized physical shapes exhibit desired physical behaviors. Evaluations on a dataset collected from Objaverse demonstrate that our framework consistently enhances the physical realism of 3D models over existing methods.

PhyPlan: Generalizable and Rapid Physical Task Planning with Physics   Informed Skill Networks for Robot Manipulators,"Mudit Chopra, Abhinav Barnawal, Harshil Vagadia, Tamajit Banerjee, Shreshth Tuli, Souvik Chakraborty, Rohan Paul","Given the task of positioning a ball-like object to a goal region beyond direct reach, humans can often throw, slide, or rebound objects against the wall to attain the goal. However, enabling robots to reason similarly is non-trivial. Existing methods for physical reasoning are data-hungry and struggle with complexity and uncertainty inherent in the real world. This paper presents PhyPlan, a novel physics-informed planning framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable embodied agents to perform dynamic physical tasks. PhyPlan leverages PINNs to simulate and predict outcomes of actions in a fast and accurate manner and uses MCTS for planning. It dynamically determines whether to consult a PINN-based simulator (coarse but fast) or engage directly with the actual environment (fine but slow) to determine optimal policy. Given an unseen task, PhyPlan can infer the sequence of actions and learn the latent parameters, resulting in a generalizable approach that can rapidly learn to perform novel physical tasks. Evaluation with robots in simulated 3D environments demonstrates the ability of our approach to solve 3D-physical reasoning tasks involving the composition of dynamic skills. Quantitatively, PhyPlan excels in several aspects: (i) it achieves lower regret when learning novel tasks compared to the state-of-the-art, (ii) it expedites skill learning and enhances the speed of physical reasoning, (iii) it demonstrates higher data efficiency compared to a physics un-informed approach.",2024-04-22T06:35:08Z,2024-04-22T06:35:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00001v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00001v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Physics3D: Learning Physical Properties of 3D Gaussians via Video   Diffusion,"Fangfu Liu, Hanyang Wang, Shunyu Yao, Shengjun Zhang, Jie Zhou, Yueqi Duan","In recent years, there has been rapid development in 3D generation models, opening up new possibilities for applications such as simulating the dynamic movements of 3D objects and customizing their behaviors. However, current 3D generative models tend to focus only on surface features such as color and shape, neglecting the inherent physical properties that govern the behavior of objects in the real world. To accurately simulate physics-aligned dynamics, it is essential to predict the physical properties of materials and incorporate them into the behavior prediction process. Nonetheless, predicting the diverse materials of real-world objects is still challenging due to the complex nature of their physical attributes. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Physics3D}, a novel method for learning various physical properties of 3D objects through a video diffusion model. Our approach involves designing a highly generalizable physical simulation system based on a viscoelastic material model, which enables us to simulate a wide range of materials with high-fidelity capabilities. Moreover, we distill the physical priors from a video diffusion model that contains more understanding of realistic object materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both elastic and plastic materials.

Statistical Patterns in the Equations of Physics and the Emergence of a   Meta-Law of Nature,"Andrei Constantin, Deaglan Bartlett, Harry Desmond, Pedro G. Ferreira","Physics, as a fundamental science, aims to understand the laws of Nature and describe them in mathematical equations. While the physical reality manifests itself in a wide range of phenomena with varying levels of complexity, the equations that describe them display certain statistical regularities and patterns, which we begin to explore here. By drawing inspiration from linguistics, where Zipf's law states that the frequency of any word in a large corpus of text is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table, we investigate whether similar patterns for the distribution of operators emerge in the equations of physics. We analyse three corpora of formulae and find, using sophisticated implicit-likelihood methods, that the frequency of operators as a function of their rank in the frequency table is best described by an exponential law with a stable exponent, in contrast with Zipf's inverse power-law. Understanding the underlying reasons behind this statistical pattern may shed light on Nature's modus operandi or reveal recurrent patterns in physicists' attempts to formalise the laws of Nature. It may also provide crucial input for symbolic regression, potentially augmenting language models to generate symbolic models for physical phenomena. By pioneering the study of statistical regularities in the equations of physics, our results open the door for a meta-law of Nature, a (probabilistic) law that all physical laws obey.",2024-08-12T18:34:57Z,2024-08-12T18:34:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11065v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11065v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.CL, hep-th, physics.data-an, physics.hist-ph"
Physics-aligned Schrödinger bridge,"Zeyu Li, Hongkun Dou, Shen Fang, Wang Han, Yue Deng, Lijun Yang","The reconstruction of physical fields from sparse measurements is pivotal in both scientific research and engineering applications. Traditional methods are increasingly supplemented by deep learning models due to their efficacy in extracting features from data. However, except for the low accuracy on complex physical systems, these models often fail to comply with essential physical constraints, such as governing equations and boundary conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel data-driven field reconstruction framework, termed the Physics-aligned Schr\""{o}dinger Bridge (PalSB). This framework leverages a diffusion Schr\""{o}dinger bridge mechanism that is specifically tailored to align with physical constraints. The PalSB approach incorporates a dual-stage training process designed to address both local reconstruction mapping and global physical principles. Additionally, a boundary-aware sampling technique is implemented to ensure adherence to physical boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PalSB through its application to three complex nonlinear systems: cylinder flow from Particle Image Velocimetry experiments, two-dimensional turbulence, and a reaction-diffusion system. The results reveal that PalSB not only achieves higher accuracy but also exhibits enhanced compliance with physical constraints compared to existing methods. This highlights PalSB's capability to generate high-quality representations of intricate physical interactions, showcasing its potential for advancing field reconstruction techniques.",2024-09-26T13:22:22Z,2024-09-26T13:22:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17825v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17825v1,"physics.flu-dyn, cs.LG"
Towards World Simulator: Crafting Physical Commonsense-Based Benchmark   for Video Generation,"Fanqing Meng, Jiaqi Liao, Xinyu Tan, Wenqi Shao, Quanfeng Lu, Kaipeng Zhang, Yu Cheng, Dianqi Li, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo","Text-to-video (T2V) models like Sora have made significant strides in visualizing complex prompts, which is increasingly viewed as a promising path towards constructing the universal world simulator. Cognitive psychologists believe that the foundation for achieving this goal is the ability to understand intuitive physics. However, the capacity of these models to accurately represent intuitive physics remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhyGenBench, a comprehensive \textbf{Phy}sics \textbf{Gen}eration \textbf{Ben}chmark designed to evaluate physical commonsense correctness in T2V generation. PhyGenBench comprises 160 carefully crafted prompts across 27 distinct physical laws, spanning four fundamental domains, which could comprehensively assesses models' understanding of physical commonsense. Alongside PhyGenBench, we propose a novel evaluation framework called PhyGenEval. This framework employs a hierarchical evaluation structure utilizing appropriate advanced vision-language models and large language models to assess physical commonsense. Through PhyGenBench and PhyGenEval, we can conduct large-scale automated assessments of T2V models' understanding of physical commonsense, which align closely with human feedback. Our evaluation results and in-depth analysis demonstrate that current models struggle to generate videos that comply with physical commonsense. Moreover, simply scaling up models or employing prompt engineering techniques is insufficient to fully address the challenges presented by PhyGenBench (e.g., dynamic scenarios). We hope this study will inspire the community to prioritize the learning of physical commonsense in these models beyond entertainment applications.

Phys4DGen: A Physics-Driven Framework for Controllable and Efficient 4D   Content Generation from a Single Image,"Jiajing Lin, Zhenzhong Wang, Shu Jiang, Yongjie Hou, Min Jiang","The task of 4D content generation involves creating dynamic 3D models that evolve over time in response to specific input conditions, such as images. Existing methods rely heavily on pre-trained video diffusion models to guide 4D content dynamics, but these approaches often fail to capture essential physical principles, as video diffusion models lack a robust understanding of real-world physics. Moreover, these models face challenges in providing fine-grained control over dynamics and exhibit high computational costs. In this work, we propose Phys4DGen, a novel, high-efficiency framework that generates physics-compliant 4D content from a single image with enhanced control capabilities. Our approach uniquely integrates physical simulations into the 4D generation pipeline, ensuring adherence to fundamental physical laws. Inspired by the human ability to infer physical properties visually, we introduce a Physical Perception Module (PPM) that discerns the material properties and structural components of the 3D object from the input image, facilitating accurate downstream simulations. Phys4DGen significantly accelerates the 4D generation process by eliminating iterative optimization steps in the dynamics modeling phase. It allows users to intuitively control the movement speed and direction of generated 4D content by adjusting external forces, achieving finely tunable, physically plausible animations. Extensive evaluations show that Phys4DGen outperforms existing methods in both inference speed and physical realism, producing high-quality, controllable 4D content.

Some field equations with composite operators in octonion spaces,Zi-Hua Weng,"The paper aims to explore the impact of composite operators containing a few physical quantities on the gravitational and electromagnetic fields, studying the influencing factors and physical properties of octonion field equations. J. C. Maxwell first utilized the quaternions and vector terminology to describe the electromagnetic fields. The octonions can be used to simultaneously describe the physical quantities of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the octonion field potential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque and force. In the octonion spaces, the field strength and quaternion operator are able to combine together to become one composite operator, making an important contribution to the field equations. Similarly, the field potential can also form some composite operators with the quaternion operator, and they have a certain impact on the field equations. Furthermore, other physical quantities can also be combined with the quaternion operator to form several composite operators. In these composite operators, multiple physical quantities can also have a certain impact on the field equations. In other words, the field strength does not occupy a unique central position, compared to other physical quantities in these composite operators. In the field theories described by the octonions, various field equations can be derived from the application of different composite operators. According to different composite operators, it is able to infer the field equations when the field strength or/and field potential make a certain contribution, and it is also possible to deduce several new field equations when the remaining physical quantities play a certain role. This further deepens the understanding of the physical properties of field equations.",2025-01-11T08:07:14Z,2025-01-11T08:07:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07604v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07604v1,physics.gen-ph
Data for Polarization in Charmless B -> phi K^*: A Signal for New   Physics?,"Prasanta Kumar Das, Kwei-Chou Yang","The recent observations of sizable transverse fractions of B-> phi K* are strongly contrary to the Standard Model expectation. We analyze all possible new-physics four-quark operators. We find that two classes of new-physics operators could offer resolutions to the B-> phi K* polarization anomaly. The (1-\gamma_5)\otimes (1-\gamma_5) and \sigma(1-\gamma_5)\otimes \sigma(1-\gamma_5) operators in the first class contribute to different helicity amplitudes as H{00}: H{--}: H{++} ~ O(1/mb):O(1):O(1/mb^2), while the contributions arising from (1+\gamma_5)\otimes (1+\gamma_5) and \sigma(1+\gamma_5)\otimes \sigma(1+\gamma_5) operators in the second class to various helicity amplitudes are given as H{00}: H{--}: H{++} ~ O(1/mb):O(1/mb^2):O(1). For each class of new physics, we find that all new physics effects can be lumped into a single parameter. Two possible experimental results of polarization phases, \arg(A_\perp)- \arg(A_\parallel) ~ \pi or 0, originating from the phase ambiguity in data, could be separately accounted for by our two new-physics scenarios: (i) the first scenario with the first class new-physics operators, and (ii) the second scenario with the second class new-physics operators. The consistency between the data and the new physics analysis, suggests a small new-physics weak phase, together with a large strong phase. We obtain sizable transversely polarized amplitudes \Lambda_{\parallel\parallel} + \Lambda_{\perp\perp} = \Lambda_{00}. In the second scenario, we find \Lambda_{\parallel\parallel} ~ \Lambda_{\perp\perp}, while, in the first scenario, we obtain \Lambda_{\parallel\parallel} ~ \Lambda_{\perp\perp}/2.

In addition, atomic physics has recently shown substantial progress in the development of optical clocks and atom interferometers. If placed in space, these instruments could turn into powerful high-resolution quantum sensors greatly benefiting fundamental physics.   We discuss the current status of space-based research in fundamental physics, its discovery potential, and its importance for modern science. We offer a set of recommendations to be considered by the upcoming National Academy of Sciences' Decadal Survey in Astronomy and Astrophysics. In our opinion, the Decadal Survey should include space-based research in fundamental physics as one of its focus areas. We recommend establishing an Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee's interagency ``Fundamental Physics Task Force'' to assess the status of both ground- and space-based efforts in the field, to identify the most important objectives, and to suggest the best ways to organize the work of several federal agencies involved. We also recommend establishing a new NASA-led interagency program in fundamental physics that will consolidate new technologies, prepare key instruments for future space missions, and build a strong scientific and engineering community.

`What is a Thing?': Topos Theory in the Foundations of Physics,"Andreas Doering, Chris Isham","The goal of this paper is to summarise the first steps in developing a fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to Heidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''.   Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other theories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this paper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity $A$ with an arrow $\breve{A}_\phi:\Si_\phi\map\R_\phi$ where $\Si_\phi$ and $\R_\phi$ are two special objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the appropriate topos, $\tau_\phi$.   We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, $S$. The first, $\PL{S}$, is a propositional language; the second, $\L{S}$, is a higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. With the aid of $\PL{S}$ we expand and develop some of the earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum physics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf $\Sig$--the topos quantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is $\SetH{}$: the category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially ordered set) $\V{}$ of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded operators on the quantum Hilbert space $\Hi$.",2008-03-04T11:38:15Z,2008-03-04T11:38:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0417v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0417v1,"quant-ph, gr-qc, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"
On the physical basis of cosmic time,"Svend Erik Rugh, Henrik Zinkernagel","In this manuscript we initiate a systematic examination of the physical basis for the time concept in cosmology. We discuss and defend the idea that the physical basis of the time concept is necessarily related to physical processes which could conceivably take place among the material constituents available in the universe. It is common practice to link the concept of cosmic time with a space-time metric set up to describe the universe at large scales, and then define a cosmic time $t$ as what is measured by a comoving standard clock. We want to examine, however, the physical basis for setting up a comoving reference frame and, in particular, what could be meant by a standard clock. For this purpose we introduce the concept of a `core' of a clock (which, for a standard clock in cosmology, is a scale-setting physical process) and we ask if such a core can--in principle--be found in the available physics contemplated in the various `stages' of the early universe. We find that a first problem arises above the quark-gluon phase transition (which roughly occurs when the cosmological model is extrapolated back to $\sim 10^{-5}$ seconds) where there might be no bound systems left, and the concept of a physical length scale to a certain extent disappears. A more serious problem appears above the electroweak phase transition believed to occur at $\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds. At this point the property of mass (almost) disappears and it becomes difficult to identify a physical basis for concepts like length scale, energy scale and temperature -- which are all intimately linked to the concept of time in modern cosmology. This situation suggests that the concept of a time scale in `very early' universe cosmology lacks a physical basis or, at least, that the time scale will have to be based on speculative new physics.",2008-05-13T22:29:44Z,2008-05-13T22:29:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1947v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1947v1,"gr-qc, astro-ph, hep-th"
The Virtual Reality Conjecture,Brian Whitworth,"We take our world to be an objective reality, but is it? The assumption that the physical world exists in and of itself has struggled to assimilate the findings of modern physics for some time now. For example, an objective space and time would just ""be"", but in relativity, space contracts and time dilates. Likewise objective ""things"" should just inherently exist, but the entities of quantum theory are probability of existence smears, that spread, tunnel, superpose and entangle in physically impossible ways. Cosmology even tells us that our entire physical universe just ""popped up"", from nowhere, about 14 billion years ago. This is not how an objectively real world should behave! Yet traditional alternatives don't work much better. That the world is just an illusion of the mind doesn't explain its consistent realism and Descartes dualism, that another reality beyond the physical exists, just doubles the existential problem. It is time to consider an option we might normally dismiss out of hand. This essay explores the virtual reality conjecture, that the physical world is the digital output of non-physical quantum processing. It finds it neither illogical, nor unscientific, nor incompatible with current physics. In this model, quantum entities are programs, movement is the transfer of processing, interactions are processing overloads and the fields of physics are network properties. It has no empty space, no singularities and all the conservations of physics just conserve processing. Its prediction, that the collision of high frequency light in a vacuum can create permanent matter, will test it. If the physical world has the properties of a processing output, physics must rewrite the story behind its equations.",2011-10-13T03:13:54Z,2011-10-13T03:13:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3307v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.3307v1,physics.gen-ph
Attempts of Transforming Teacher Practice Through Professional   Development,"Vera Montalbano, Roberto Benedetti, Emilio Mariotti, Maria Alessandra Mariotti, Antonella Porri","A difficult challenge in physics education is to design professional development programs for teachers, which can lead to fundamental changes in their practise. We report all activities for physics teachers in the context of the National Plan for Scientific Degrees in Southern Tuscany. Research and practice have shown that physics teaching in school is inadequate. The main consequences are limited achievements in school, decrease of students' interests in learning physics and decrease of enrolments in physics in many countries. In recent years, the decline in enrolments was faced up with the launch of a wide national project addressed to secondary school students and teachers. The active involvement of teachers in the design of laboratories was found to be essential for obtaining actions which were not transitory and entered permanently in classroom practice. We describe some advanced courses in Physics and Mathematics Education realized few years ago and courses designed for a Master in Physics Educational Innovation and Orienting performed jointly by many Italian universities. Other activities are less formal but equally relevant, such as the active involvement of expert, young and in training teachers in designing and implementation of laboratory activities for a summer school of physics. Recently, we developed a workshop for teachers of physics and mathematics on modelling. which continued in an updating course for teachers in which selected topics, named in the same way in both disciplines, were discussed in order to design interdisciplinary learning paths. The purpose is to clarify these topics by using specific tools from physics and mathematics and to outline the similarities and the differences in both contexts.

Generalized Dualities in 1T-Physics as Holographic Predictions from   2T-Physics,"Ignacio J. Araya, Itzhak Bars","In the conventional formalism of physics, with 1-time, systems with different Hamiltonians or Lagrangians have different physical interpretations and are considered to be independent systems unrelated to each other. However, in this paper we construct explicitly canonical maps in 1T phase space (including timelike components, specifically the Hamiltonian) to show that it is appropriate to regard various 1T-physics systems, with different Lagrangians or Hamiltonians, as being duals of each other. This concept is similar in spirit to dualities discovered in more complicated examples in field theory or string theory. Our approach makes it evident that such generalized dualities are widespread. This suggests that, as a general phenomenon, there are hidden relations and hidden symmetries that conventional 1T-physics does not capture, implying the existence of a more unified formulation of physics that naturally supplies the hidden information. In fact, we show that 2T-physics in (d+2)-dimensions is the generator of these dualities in 1T-physics in d-dimensions by providing a holographic perspective that unifies all the dual 1T systems into one. The unifying ingredient is a gauge symmetry in phase space. Via such dualities it is then possible to gain new insights toward new physical predictions not suspected before, and suggest new methods of computation that yield results not obtained before. As an illustration, we will provide concrete examples of 1T-systems in classical mechanics that are solved analytically for the first time via our dualities. These dualities in classical mechanics have counterparts in quantum mechanics and field theory, and in some simpler cases they have already been constructed in field theory. We comment on the impact of our approach on the meaning of spacetime and on the development of new computational methods based on dualities.",2013-11-17T19:27:36Z,2014-02-11T06:49:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4205v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4205v2,"hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"
Investigating society's educational debts due to racism and sexism in   student attitudes about physics using quantitative critical race theory,"Jayson Nissen, Ian Her Many Horses, Ben Van Dusen","The American Physical Society calls on its members to improve the diversity of physics by supporting an inclusive culture that encourages women and Black, Indigenous, and people of color to become physicists. In the current educational system, it is unlikely for a student to become a physicist if they do not share the same attitudes about what it means to learn and do physics as those held by most professional physicists. Evidence shows college physics courses and degree programs do not support students in developing these attitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter college physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of attitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting relationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes about learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students attitudes as measured by the Colorado learning attitudes about science survey. The data came from the LASSO database and included 2170 students in 46 calculus-based mechanics courses and 2503 students in 49 algebra-based mechanics courses taught at 18 institutions. Like prior studies, we found that attitudes either did not change or slightly decreased for most groups. Results identified large differences across intersecting race and gender groups representing educational debts society owes these students. White students, particularly White men in calculus-based courses, tended to have more expert-like attitudes than any other group of students. Instruction that addresses society's educational debts can help move physics toward an inclusive culture supportive of diverse students and professionals.",2021-03-12T15:09:30Z,2021-03-12T15:09:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07336v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07336v1,physics.ed-ph

The algebraic framework is used in construction of physically interesting solvable models described by (2+1) dimensional Dirac equation. It is applied in description of open-cage fullerenes where the energies and wave functions of low-energy charge-carriers are computed. The potential algebras are also used in construction of shape-invariant, one-dimensional Dirac operators.

Simon van der Meer and his legacy to CERN and particle accelerators,Vinod Chohan,"Simon van der Meer was a brilliant scientist and a true giant in the field of accelerators.

Simon van der Meer and Carlo Rubbia were the first CERN scientists to become Nobel laureates in Physics in 1984.

Physical unitarity of a massive Yang-Mills theory without the Higgs   field from a viewpoint of confinement,"Kei-Ichi Kondo, Kenta Suzuki, Hitoshi Fukamachi, Shogo Nishino, Toru Shinohara","In this talk, we examine the physical unitarity in a massive Yang-Mills theory without the Higgs field in which the color gauge symmetry is not spontaneously broken and kept intact. For this purpose, we use a new framework proposed one of the authors based on a nonperturbative construction of a non-Abelian field describing a massive spin-one vector boson field, which enables us to perform the perturbative and nonperturbative studies on the physical unitarity. Moreover, we present a new perturbative treatment for the physical unitarity after giving the general properties of the massive Yang-Mills theory. Then we reproduce the violation of physical unitarity in a transparent way. This work is a preliminary work to the subsequent works in which we present a nonperturbative framework to propose a possible scenario of restoring the physical unitarity in the Curci-Ferrari model.

A Study on Spectral Efficiency of Physical Layer over Cognitive Radio,"Fotis Foukalas, Lazaros Merakos","Despite the conclusive potential of cognitive radio for provisioning the dynamic and flexible spectrum/channel allocation, the research community should study the performance gain of physical layer over such a radio with cognition capabilities. To this end, several mechanisms of physical layers such as adaptive modulation, multiple-input multiple output antennas; channel coding and/or combination of them should be studied. These studies should be accomplished in terms of spectral efficiency. Therefore, the gain of cognitive radio in wireless networks available into the market will be identified practically. Another issue under consideration should be the performance evaluation of cognitive radio assuming a cross-layer combination between the cognitive physical and the upper layers. To this direction, this paper presents a study on spectral efficiency at the physical layer with cognitive capabilities. In sequel, we study a cross-layer combination of physical layer with upper layers in the same cognitive context. The performance gain of cognitive radio in such a physical layer is realized practically as well as a few cross-layer design issues have been raised.",2013-02-11T19:26:17Z,2013-02-11T19:26:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2577v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.2577v1,"cs.ET, cs.NI"

We show that even if the second group of axioms is dropped, there are no deformations of Quantum Mechanics which preserve the kinematic axioms.

Such physics is no longer the exclusive domain of quantum field theories and other esoteric mathematical musings; instead, real physics of real systems is governed by such equations, and important materials science and practical implications hinge on our understanding of Dirac particles in two and three dimensions. While the physics that gives rise to the massless Dirac Fermions in each of the above mentioned materials is different, the low energy properties are governed by the same Dirac kinematics.

One might oversimplify the history of the features which (i) give mass to the W and Z particles that mediate the weak nuclear interaction, (ii) effectively break gauge invariance, (iii) eliminate physically unacceptable Nambu-Goldstone bosons, and (iv) give mass to fermions (like the electron) by collectively calling them the London-Anderson-Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble-Weinberg mechanism. More important are the implications for the future: a Higgs boson appears to point toward supersymmetry, since new physics is required to protect its mass from enormous quantum corrections, while the discovery of neutrino masses seems to point toward grand unification of the nongravitational forces.",2013-06-18T02:45:22Z,2013-06-18T02:45:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4061v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4061v1,"hep-ph, cond-mat.supr-con, hep-th, quant-ph"

We introduce volume weight functions as multipliers of the geometric equations and use these mutipliers to enforce physical volume evolution in the unified equations. The latter predict, in accordance with Sternberg's Law, exponential decay for volume evolution. We describe both the PDE versions, which are generalisations of Bloore's equations and their heuristic ODE approximations, called the box equations. The latter are suitable for tracking the collective abrasion of large particle populations. The mutual abrasion of identical particles, called the self-dual ows, play a key role in explaining geological scenarios. We give stability criteria for the self-dual ows in terms of the parameters of the physical volume evolution models and show that under reasonable assumptions these criteria can be met by physical systems. We also study a natural generalisation, the unidirectional Bloore equation, covering the case of unidirectional abrasion. We have previously shown that his equation admits travelling front solutions with circular profiles.

Open Source Physics (OSP) focuses on design of computer models, such as Easy Java Simulations (EJS) and the use of video modeling and analysis (Tracker). They allow students to investigate, explore and analyse data which is either real or simulated. The OSP approach helps users overcome barriers in creating, using and scaling up meaningful ICT use in education. In Singapore, teachers and students have created or customised existing computer models to design and re-purpose EJS models to suit their context and learning needs. Tracker tools allow students to analyse different aspects of a physics phenomena to deepen their understanding of abstract physics concepts. Using Tracker, students record the motion of objects and create their own models to test their ideas in the study of kinematics.

The slingshot effect: a possible new laser-driven high energy   acceleration mechanism for electrons,"Gaetano Fiore, Renato Fedele, Umberto de Angelis","We show that under appropriate conditions the impact of a very short and intense laser pulse onto a plasma causes the expulsion of surface electrons with high energy in the direction opposite to the one of propagation of the pulse. This is due to the combined effects of the ponderomotive force and the huge longitudinal field arising from charge separation (""slingshot effect""). The effect should also be present with other states of matter, provided the pulse is sufficiently intense to locally cause complete ionization.

Summary of the Nobel Symposium on LHC Results,John Ellis,"This is a personal summary of points made during, and arising from the symposium, drawing largely from the talks presented there. The Standard Model is doing fine, including QCD, the electroweak sector and flavour physics. The good news is that a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson has appeared with the predicted mass, but the bad news is that the LHC has provided no hint of other new physics. On the other hand, physics beyond the Standard Model is needed to explain neutrino masses and mixing, and we look forward to experiments revealing their mass hierarchy and CP violation. Cosmology and astrophysics also require new physics to explain the origin of matter, dark matter, dark energy and the CMB fluctuations. I still think that supersymmetry is the best-motivated extension of the Standard Model, and look forward to the next phases of LHC operation at higher energy and luminosity. In the mean time, ideas abound for a new accelerator to study the Higgs boson in detail and/or whatever else the LHC may reveal in its next run.",2013-09-13T19:40:01Z,2013-09-13T19:40:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3549v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.3549v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex, hep-th"
An area law for entanglement from exponential decay of correlations,"Fernando G. S. L. Brandao, Michal Horodecki","Area laws for entanglement in quantum many-body systems give useful information about their low-temperature behaviour and are tightly connected to the possibility of good numerical simulations. An intuition from quantum many-body physics suggests that an area law should hold whenever there is exponential decay of correlations in the system, a property found, for instance, in non-critical phases of matter. However, the existence of quantum data-hiding state--that is, states having very small correlations, yet a volume scaling of entanglement--was believed to be a serious obstruction to such an implication. Here we prove that notwithstanding the phenomenon of data hiding, one-dimensional quantum many-body states satisfying exponential decay of correlations always fulfil an area law. To obtain this result we combine several recent advances in quantum information theory, thus showing the usefulness of the field for addressing problems in other areas of physics.",2013-09-15T19:21:35Z,2013-09-15T19:21:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3789v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.3789v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.str-el, math-ph, math.MP"

Flavor signatures of isosinglet vector-like down quark model,"Ashutosh Kumar Alok, Subhashish Banerjee, Dinesh Kumar, S.

We perform a chi square fit to the flavor physics data and obtain the preferred central values along with errors of all the elements of the measurable 3 X 4 quark mixing matrix. The fit indicates that all the new-physics parameters are consistent with zero and the mixing of the b' quark with the other three is constrained to be small. The current flavor physics data rules out possibility of detectable new physics signals in most of the flavor physics observables.

Three-body Physics in Strongly Correlated Spinor Condensates,"V. E. Colussi, Chris H. Greene, J. P. D'Incao","Spinor condensates have proven to be a rich area for probing many-body phenomena richer than that of an ultracold gas consisting of atoms restricted to a single spin state. In the strongly correlated regime, the physics controlling the possible novel phases of the condensate remains largely unexplored, and few-body aspects can play a central role in the properties and dynamics of the system through manifestations of Efimov physics. The present study solves the three-body problem for bosonic spinors using the hyperspherical adiabatic representation and characterizes the multiple families of Efimov states in spinor systems as well as their signatures in the scattering observables relevant for spinor condensates. These solutions exhibit a rich array of possible phenomena originating in universal few-body physics, which can strongly affect the spin dynamics and three-body mean-field contributions for spinor condensates. The collisional aspects of atom-dimer spinor condensates are also analyzed and effects are predicted that derive from Efimov physics.",2014-02-12T17:45:54Z,2014-02-12T17:45:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2911v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2911v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, physics.atom-ph"
Statistical physics of hard combinatorial optimization: The vertex cover   problem,"Jin-Hua Zhao, Hai-Jun Zhou","Typical-case computation complexity is a research topic at the boundary of computer science, applied mathematics, and statistical physics. In the last twenty years the replica-symmetry-breaking mean field theory of spin glasses and the associated message-passing algorithms have greatly deepened our understanding of typical-case computation complexity. In this paper we use the vertex cover problem, a basic nondeterministic-polynomial (NP)-complete combinatorial optimization problem of wide application, as an example to introduce the statistical physical methods and algorithms. We do not go into the technical details but emphasize mainly the intuitive physical meanings of the message-passing equations.

Probing New Physics with $B^0_s\to μ^+μ^-$: Status and Perspectives,Robert Fleischer,"The rare decay $B^0_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$ plays a key role for the testing of the Standard Model. It is pointed out that the sizable decay width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ of the $B_s$-meson system affects this channel in a subtle way. As a consequence, its calculated Standard Model branching ratio has to be upscaled by about 10%. Moreover, the sizable $\Delta\Gamma_s$ makes a new observable through the effective $B^0_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$ lifetime accessible, which probes New Physics in a way complementary to the branching ratio and adds an exciting new topic to the agenda for the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. Further probes of New Physics are offered by a CP-violating rate asymmetry.

Is String Interaction the Origin of Quantum Mechanics?,"Itzhak Bars, Dmitry Rychkov","String theory developed by demanding consistency with quantum mechanics. In this paper we wish to reverse the reasoning. We pretend open string field theory is a fully consistent definition of the theory - it is at least a self consistent sector. Then we find in its structure that the rules of quantum mechanics emerge from the non-commutative nature of the basic string joining/splitting interactions, thus deriving rather than assuming the quantum commutation rules among the usual canonical quantum variables for all physical systems derivable from open string field theory. Morally we would apply such an argument to M-theory to cover all physics. If string or M-theory really underlies all physics, it seems that the door has been opened to an understanding of the origins of quantum mechanics.",2014-07-25T09:38:51Z,2014-09-23T17:39:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6833v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.6833v3,"hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"
The process matrix framework for a single-party system,Tomoyuki Morimae,"The process matrix framework [O. Oreshkov, F. Costa, and C. Brukner, Nature Communications {\bf3}, 1092 (2012)] can describe general physical theory where locally operations are described by completely-positive maps but globally no fixed causal structure is assumed. In this framework, two parties who perform measurements on each single-qubit system can violate a ""causal inequality"", which is not violated if the global fixed causal structure exists. Since the standard quantum physics assumes a fixed global causal structure, the process matrix framework can describe more general physical theory than the standard quantum physics. In this paper, we show that for a single-party system the process matrix framework is reduced to the standard quantum physics, and therefore no exotic effect beyond the standard quantum physics can be observed. This result is analogous to the well known fact in the Bell inequality violation: a single-party system can be described by a local hidden variable theory, whereas more than two parties can violate the Bell inequality.",2014-08-07T02:09:03Z,2016-06-07T02:49:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1464v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.1464v3,quant-ph
Conservation of writhe helicity under anti-parallel reconnection,"Christian E. Laing, Renzo L. Ricca, De Witt L. Sumners","Reconnection is a fundamental event in many areas of science, from the interaction of vortices in classical and quantum fluids, and magnetic flux tubes in magnetohydrodynamics and plasma physics, to the recombination in polymer physics and DNA biology. By using fundamental results in topological fluid mechanics, the helicity of a flux tube can be calculated in terms of writhe and twist contributions. Here we show that the writhe is conserved under anti-parallel reconnection. Hence, for a pair of interacting flux tubes of equal flux, if the twist of the reconnected tube is the sum of the original twists of the interacting tubes, then helicity is conserved during reconnection. Thus, any deviation from helicity conservation is entirely due to the intrinsic twist inserted or deleted locally at the reconnection site. This result has important implications for helicity and energy considerations in various physical contexts.",2014-10-14T06:34:55Z,2014-10-14T06:34:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3588v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3588v1,"math-ph, math.MP, physics.bio-ph, physics.flu-dyn, physics.plasm-ph"

In recent years their study has grown intensively, due to the discovery of non-trivial examples that apply to different types of theories and different numbers of dimensions.

Exciton-polariton condensates,"Tim Byrnes, Na Young Kim, Yoshihisa Yamamoto","Recently a new type of system exhibiting spontaneous coherence has emerged -- the exciton-polariton condensate. Exciton-polaritons (or polaritons for short) are bosonic quasiparticles that exist inside semiconductor microcavities, consisting of a superposition of an exciton and a cavity photon. Above a threshold density the polaritons macroscopically occupy the same quantum state, forming a condensate. The lifetime of the polaritons are typically comparable to or shorter than thermalization times, making them possess an inherently non-equilibrium nature. Nevertheless, they display many of the features that would be expected of equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The non-equilibrium nature of the system raises fundamental questions of what it means for a system to be a BEC, and introduces new physics beyond that seen in other macroscopically coherent systems. In this review we focus upon several physical phenomena exhibited by exciton-polariton condensates. In particular we examine topics such as the difference between a polariton BEC, a polariton laser, and a photon laser, as well as physical phenomena such as superfluidity, vortex formation, BKT (Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) and BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) physics.

Equivalence of zeta function technique and Abel-Plana formula in   regularizing the Casimir energy of hyper-rectangular cavities,"Rui-hui Lin, Xiang-hua Zhai","Zeta function regularization is an effective method to extract physical significant quantities from infinite ones. It is regarded as mathematically simple and elegant but the isolation of the physical divergency is hidden in its analytic continuation. By contrast, Abel-Plana formula method permits explicit separation of divergent terms. In regularizing the Casimir energy for a massless scalar field in a $D$-dimensional rectangular box, we give the rigorous proof of the equivalence of the two methods by deriving the reflection formula of Epstein zeta function from repeatedly application of Abel-plana formula and giving the physical interpretation of the infinite integrals.

The inhomogeneous scalar field is used to illustrate the ideas. It is argued that there are two reasonable definitions of the local physical content associated with a locally covariant theory; when these coincide, the theory is said to be dynamically local.

Global gauge symmetries, not seen by the observables, are nevertheless displayed by detectable properties of the states (superselected quantum numbers and parastatistics). Local gauge symmetries are not seen also by the physical states; they appear only in non-positive representations of field algebras. Their role at the Lagrangian level is merely to ensure the validity on the physical states of local Gauss laws, obeyed by the currents which generate the corresponding global gauge symmetries; they are responsible for most distinctive physical properties of gauge quantum field theories.

The choice of a particular parametrisation depends on a non-obvious balance of quantity and quality of the available experimental data, envisaged purpose for the parametrisation and degree of model independence, importance of the radiative corrections, and scale at which new particles appear explicitly in the physical spectrum.   The most refined constraints can only be obtained by the experimental collaborations at present, as information about correlation between the various uncertainties on the different decay modes is not completely available in the public domain.

In order to furnish the identity with physical meaning, we exactly reproduce these probabilities as the square of three point functions involving certain hook-shaped backgrounds. We study these backgrounds in the context of LLM geometries and discover that they are domain walls interpolating two AdS spaces with different radii.

Identity statuses in upper-division physics students,"Paul W. Irving, Eleanor C. Sayre","We use the theories of identity statuses and communities of practice to describe three different case studies of students finding their paths through undergraduate physics and developing a physics subject-specific identity. Each case study demonstrates a unique path that reinforces the link between the theories of communities of practice and identity statuses. The case studies also illustrate how students progress and regress in their commitment to their subject-specific identities and their professional identities. The progression/regression is dependent on their willingness to explore different aspects of a physics professional identity and their availability to carry out such exploration. Identity status and future identity crises can manifest in students' behavior in the classroom. Allowing students to engage in more legitimate practices of the physics community, especially in the form of undergraduate research, helps students to explore their opportunities and inform the level of commitment they wish to make to physics.",2015-05-28T19:03:31Z,2015-05-28T19:03:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07801v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07801v1,physics.ed-ph
Student thinking about the divergence and curl in mathematics and   physics contexts,"Charles Baily, Laurens Bollen, Andrew Pattie, Paul van Kampen, Mieke De Cock","Undergraduate physics students are known to have difficulties with understanding mathematical tools, and with applying their knowledge of mathematics to physical contexts. Using survey statements based on student interviews and written responses to open-ended questions, we investigated the prevalence of correct and incorrect conceptions regarding the divergence and curl of vector fields, among both mathematics and physics students. We compare and contrast pre-instruction responses from intermediate-level E&M students at KU Leuven and the University of St Andrews, with post-instruction responses from St Andrews students enrolled in a vector calculus course. The differences between these student populations were primarily in areas having to do with physics-related concepts and graphical representations of vector fields. Our comparison of pre- and post-instruction responses from E&M students shows that their understanding of the divergence and curl improved significantly in most areas, though not as much as would be desired.",2015-07-03T08:42:50Z,2015-09-26T17:22:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00849v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00849v2,physics.ed-ph

Previous work focused on establishing the accuracy and clarity of the instrument through student interviews and preliminary testing. Ongoing validation efforts include establishing the extent to which student epistemologies as measured by E-CLASS align with other measures of student learning outcomes (e.g., course grades).

Unpacking Symbolic Equations in Introductory Physics,Eugene T. Torigoe,"Symbolic equations are one of the many representations used in physics. Understanding these representations is important for students because they are how students access knowledge in physics. In this paper I build off of the work by Redish and Kuo, which described the cultural differences between how math is used in math class and physics class, and the work by Fredlund et al, which described the importance of unpacking representations for physics student. I will describe how differences in the goals of numeric and symbolic problem solving lead to different set of affordances. In particular, the inability to distinguish variables, knowns, and unknowns in symbolic problem solving is a benefit when describing a generalized physical system. I also present evidence that observed errors when trying to solve symbolic problems are due to students acting on inappropriate cues associated with numeric problem solving.",2015-08-03T19:07:33Z,2016-06-07T18:38:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00535v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.00535v2,physics.ed-ph
Skeptical Notes on a Physics of Passage,Nick Huggett,"This paper investigates the mathematical representation of time in physics. In existing theories time is represented by the real numbers, hence their formal properties represent properties of time: these are surveyed. The central question of the paper is whether the existing representation of time is adequate, or whether it can or should be supplemented: especially, do we need a physics incorporating some kind of `dynamical passage' of time? The paper argues that the existing mathematical framework is resistant to such changes, and might have to be rejected by anyone seeking a physics of passage. Then it rebuts two common arguments for incorporating passage into physics, especially the claim that it is an element of experience. Finally the paper investigates whether, as has been claimed, `causal set theory' provides a physics of passage.",2015-08-25T18:29:01Z,2015-08-25T18:29:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06599v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06599v1,"physics.hist-ph, gr-qc"

In this paper we give the general solution to this problem emphasizing the interplay between the group structure, the corresponding algebra and the physical spectrum. This analysis is completed with a strong discussion and proving that: i) the physical states are represented by coherent states; ii) the solutions in previous references [1] are not general, ii) the symmetries of the considered physical system in [1] (equations and geometry) do not correspond to the Lorentz group but to the fourth covering: the Metaplectic group Mp(n).",2015-10-05T10:00:19Z,2015-10-05T10:00:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02123v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.02123v1,"quant-ph, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"

Although work has begun to study the patterns seen in implementing and assessing computation in introductory physics, more insight is needed to understand the observed effects of blending computation with physics in a group setting. In a newly adopted format of introductory calculus-based mechanics, called Projects and Practices in Physics, groups of students work on short modeling projects -- which make use of a novel inquiry-based approach -- to develop their understanding of both physics content and practice.

Resource theories of knowledge,"Lidia del Rio, Lea Kraemer, Renato Renner","How far can we take the resource theoretic approach to explore physics? Resource theories like LOCC, reference frames and quantum thermodynamics have proven a powerful tool to study how agents who are subject to certain constraints can act on physical systems. This approach has advanced our understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the second law of thermodynamics, and provided operational measures to quantify resources such as entanglement or information content. In this work, we significantly extend the approach and range of applicability of resource theories. Firstly we generalize the notion of resource theories to include any description or knowledge that agents may have of a physical state, beyond the density operator formalism. We show how to relate theories that differ in the language used to describe resources, like micro and macroscopic thermodynamics. Finally, we take a top-down approach to locality, in which a subsystem structure is derived from a global theory rather than assumed. The extended framework introduced here enables us to formalize new tasks in the language of resource theories, ranging from tomography, cryptography, thermodynamics and foundational questions, both within and beyond quantum theory.",2015-11-27T21:01:03Z,2015-11-27T21:01:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08818v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08818v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"

Minimizing Total Busy Time with Application to Energy-efficient   Scheduling of Virtual Machines in IaaS clouds,"Nguyen Quang-Hung, Nam Thoai","Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds have become more popular enabling users to run applications under virtual machines. Energy efficiency for IaaS clouds is still challenge. This paper investigates the energy-efficient scheduling problems of virtual machines (VMs) onto physical machines (PMs) in IaaS clouds along characteristics: multiple resources, fixed intervals and non-preemption of virtual machines. The scheduling problems are NP-hard. Most of existing works on VM placement reduce the total energy consumption by using the minimum number of active physical machines. There, however, are cases using the minimum number of physical machines results in longer the total busy time of the physical machines. For the scheduling problems, minimizing the total energy consumption of all physical machines is equivalent to minimizing total busy time of all physical machines. In this paper, we propose an scheduling algorithm, denoted as EMinTRE-LFT, for minimizing the total energy consumption of physical machines in the scheduling problems. Our extensive simulations using parallel workload models in Parallel Workload Archive show that the proposed algorithm has the least total energy consumption compared to the state-of-the art algorithms.",2016-09-19T15:09:20Z,2016-09-19T15:09:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05767v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05767v1,"cs.DC, C.2.4; D.4.7; D.4.8; H.2.4; G.3; G.4; D.2.8; C.1.4; A.0"

We consider the case where some states of the plant are not measured. Then, to estimate the states with abstracted outputs measured by sensors, we introduce a finite abstracted system of the physical plant, called an o-abstracted system, such that there exists an approximate simulation relation. The relation guarantees that an observer designed based on the state of the o-abstracted system estimates the current state of the plant. We construct a symbolic output feedback controller by composing these systems. By a relation-based approach, we proved that the controlled system approximately exhibits the desired behavior.",2016-12-15T08:48:23Z,2016-12-15T08:48:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04974v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04974v1,"cs.SY, B.5.1;I.2.8"
Learning Particle Physics by Example: Location-Aware Generative   Adversarial Networks for Physics Synthesis,"Luke de Oliveira, Michela Paganini, Benjamin Nachman","We provide a bridge between generative modeling in the Machine Learning community and simulated physical processes in High Energy Particle Physics by applying a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture to the production of jet images -- 2D representations of energy depositions from particles interacting with a calorimeter. We propose a simple architecture, the Location-Aware Generative Adversarial Network, that learns to produce realistic radiation patterns from simulated high energy particle collisions. The pixel intensities of GAN-generated images faithfully span over many orders of magnitude and exhibit the desired low-dimensional physical properties (i.e., jet mass, n-subjettiness, etc.). We shed light on limitations, and provide a novel empirical validation of image quality and validity of GAN-produced simulations of the natural world.

$B_s\toμ^+μ^-$ as current and future probe of new physics,"Wolfgang Altmannshofer, Christoph Niehoff, David M. Straub","The rare flavour-changing neutral current decay $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ is among the most important indirect probes of new physics at the LHC, as it is strongly suppressed in the Standard Model, very sensitive to new physics effects, and theoretically exceptionally clean. We present a thorough state-of-the-art analysis of the constraints on new physics from present and future measurements of this decay, focusing on scalar operators. We show model-independently and in concrete new physics models, namely the MSSM and two leptoquark scenarios, that a future precise measurement of the mass-eigenstate rate asymmetry in $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ would allow to disentangle new physics scenarios that would be indistinguishable based on measurements of the branching ratio alone. We also highlight the complementarity between $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and direct searches in both model classes.

Fine-Tuning in the Context of Bayesian Theory Testing,Luke A. Barnes,"Fine-tuning in physics and cosmology is often used as evidence that a theory is incomplete. For example, the parameters of the standard model of particle physics are ""unnaturally"" small (in various technical senses), which has driven much of the search for physics beyond the standard model. Of particular interest is the fine-tuning of the universe for life, which suggests that our universe's ability to create physical life forms is improbable and in need of explanation, perhaps by a multiverse. This claim has been challenged on the grounds that the relevant probability measure cannot be justified because it cannot be normalized, and so small probabilities cannot be inferred. We show how fine-tuning can be formulated within the context of Bayesian theory testing (or \emph{model selection}) in the physical sciences. The normalizability problem is seen to be a general problem for testing any theory with free parameters, and not a unique problem for fine-tuning. Physical theories in fact avoid such problems in one of two ways. Dimensional parameters are bounded by the Planck scale, avoiding troublesome infinities, and we are not compelled to assume that dimensionless parameters are distributed uniformly, which avoids non-normalizability.",2017-07-13T03:16:46Z,2017-07-13T03:16:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03965v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03965v1,physics.hist-ph
The role of quantum measurements in physical processes and protocols,"Benjamin Cruikshank, Kurt Jacobs","In this mainly pedagogical article, we discuss under what circumstances measurements play a special role in quantum processes. In particular we discuss the following facts which appear to be a common area of confusion: i) from a fundamental point of view measurements play no special role whatsoever: all dynamics that can be generated by measurements can be generated by unitary processes (for which post-selection is no exception), ii) from a purely physical point of view, measurements are not ""outside"" of quantum mechanics, iii) the only difference between the abilities of measurement-based protocols and unitary circuits for quantum computing comes from practical (technology dependent) constraints. We emphasize the importance of distinguishing between differences that are i) fundamental but without physical import, ii) fundamental and possess physical import, iii) are not fundamental but have practical import. We also emphasize the importance of separating theoretical and experimental elements of measurement, primarily projection and amplification, which are physically very different. Note that since we are concerned with facts regarding physical processes, this article has little if anything to do with interpretations of quantum mechanics.",2017-07-13T17:45:40Z,2017-07-13T17:45:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04241v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04241v1,quant-ph

This approach comes without the metaphysical baggage of declaring information a fundamental ingredient in physical reality and exorcises many of the otherwise puzzling problems that arise from this view-point, particularly obviating the problem of `excess baggage' in quantum mechanics.",2017-07-27T08:43:48Z,2018-12-03T11:54:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08778v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08778v3,"physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"

Survivable Probability of SDN-enabled Cloud Networking with Random   Physical Link Failure,"Zhili Zhou, Tachun Lin","Software-driven cloud networking is a new paradigm in orchestrating physical resources (CPU, network bandwidth, energy, storage) allocated to network functions, services, and applications, which is commonly modeled as a cross-layer network. This model carries a physical network representing the physical infrastructure, a logical network showing demands, and logical-to-physical node/link mappings. In such networks, a single failure in the physical network may trigger cascading failures in the logical network and disable network services and connectivity. In this paper, we propose an evaluation metric, survivable probability, to evaluate the reliability of such networks under random physical link failure(s). We propose the concept of base protecting spanning tree and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence and relation to survivability. We then develop mathematical programming formulations for reliable cross-layer network routing design with the maximal reliable probability.

Here, we study the mathematical structure of the physical process first law for a general diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. We analyze the effect of ambiguities in the Wald's definition of entropy on the physical process first law. We show that for linearized perturbations, the integrated version of the physical process law, which determines the change of entropy between two asymptotic cross-sections, is independent of these ambiguities. In case of entropy change between two intermediate cross sections of the horizon, we show that it inherits additional contributions, which coincide with the membrane energy associated with the horizon fluid. Using this interpretation, we write down a physical process first law for entropy change between two arbitrary non-stationary cross sections of the horizon for both general relativity and Lanczos-Lovelock gravity.",2017-09-26T10:16:11Z,2018-09-10T13:43:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08925v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08925v3,"gr-qc, hep-th"

ACME extracts $d_e$ from the measurement of electron spin precession due to the thorium monoxide (ThO) molecule's internal electric field. This recent ACME II measurement achieved an order of magnitude increased sensitivity over ACME I by reducing both statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the electric dipole precession frequency. The ACME II statistical uncertainty was a factor of 1.7 above the ideal shot-noise limit. We have since traced this excess noise to timing imperfections.

Those scenarios usually contain a number of free parameters that need to be adjusted by observed data. Some techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and MultiNest, are developed in order to solve the above problem. However, it is usually required a computing farm to apply those tools.

How do we achieve this from video frames or time-series data and without the knowledge of the dynamics model? We present a neural framework for estimating physical parameters in a manner consistent with the underlying physics. The neural framework uses a deep latent variable model to disentangle the system physical parameters from canonical coordinate observations. It then returns a Hamiltonian parameterization that generalizes well with respect to the discovered physical parameters. We tested our framework with simple harmonic oscillators, $n=1$, and noisy observations and show that it discovers the underlying system parameters and generalizes well with respect to these discovered parameters.

This paper proposes a metric, the Cyber-Physical Energy System Quantitative Security Metric (CPES-QSM), that quantifies the interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three domains: electrical, cyber-risk, and network topology. A method for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained AC optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of all the CPES layers. The cyber-constrained ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such as voltage stability, contingencies, graph-theory, and IoT cyber risks, while using a multi-criteria decision-making technique.

Using Analogies to Learn Introductory Physics,"Shih-Yin Lin, Chandralekha Singh","Identifying the relevant physics principles is a central component of problem solving. A major goal of most introductory physics courses is to help students discern the deep similarities between problems based upon the physics principles so that they can transfer what they learned by solving one problem to solve another problem which involves the same principle. We conducted an investigation in which 251 calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics students were asked explicitly in the recitation quiz to learn from a solved problem and then solve another problem that has different surface features but the same underlying physics principles. We find that many students were able to discern the deep similarities between the problems. When the solved problem was provided, students were likely to invoke the correct principles; however, more scaffolding is needed to help students apply these principles correctly.",2016-02-20T09:46:22Z,2016-02-20T09:46:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06388v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06388v1,physics.ed-ph
Challenges in Analogical Reasoning,"Shih-Yin Lin, Chandralekha Singh","Learning physics requires understanding the applicability of fundamental principles in a variety of contexts that share deep features. One way to help students learn physics is via analogical reasoning. Students can be taught to make an analogy between situations that are more familiar or easier to understand and another situation where the same physics principle is involved but that is more difficult to handle. Here, we examine introductory physics students' ability to use analogies in solving problems involving Newton's second law. Students enrolled in an algebra-based introductory physics course were given a solved problem involving tension in a rope and were then asked to solve another problem for which the physics is very similar but involved a frictional force. They were asked to point out the similarities between the two problems and then use the analogy to solve the friction problem.",2016-02-20T16:04:54Z,2016-02-20T16:04:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06423v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06423v1,physics.ed-ph
Detection of Cyber-Physical Faults and Intrusions from Physical   Correlations,"Andrey Y. Lokhov, Nathan Lemons, Thomas C.

These systems are composed of interdependent physical, control and communications networks described by disparate mathematical models creating scientific challenges that go well beyond the modeling and analysis of the individual networks. A key challenge in cyber-physical defense is a fast online detection and localization of faults and intrusions without prior knowledge of the failure type. We describe a set of techniques for the efficient identification of faults from correlations in physical signals, assuming only a minimal amount of available system information.

Using Categorization of Problems as an Instructional Tool to Help   Introductory Students Learn Physics,"Andrew Mason, Chandralekha Singh","The ability to categorize problems based upon underlying principles, rather than contexts, is considered a hallmark of expertise in physics problem solving. With inspiration from a classic study by Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser, we compared the categorization of 25 introductory mechanics problems based upon similarity of solution by students in large calculus-based introductory courses with physics faculty and Ph.D. students. Here, we summarize the study and suggest that a categorization task, especially when conducted with students working with peers in small groups, can be an effective pedagogical tool to help students in introductory physics courses learn to discern the underlying similarity between problems with diverse contexts but the same underlying physics principles.",2016-02-23T22:29:09Z,2016-02-23T22:29:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07680v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07680v1,physics.ed-ph
Local Thermal Equilibrium States in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory,Michael Gransee,"It is well-known that thermal equilibrium states in quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory can be described in a mathematically rigorous manner by means of the so-called Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, which is based on certain analyticity and periodicity properties of correlation functions. On the other hand, the characterization of non-equilibrium states which only locally have thermal properties still constitutes a challenge in quantum field theory. We discuss a recent proposal for characterization of such states by a generalized KMS condition. The connection of this proposal to a proposal by D. Buchholz, I. Ojima and H.-J. Roos for characterizing local thermal equilibrium states in quantum field theory is discussed.",2016-02-29T19:26:58Z,2016-02-29T19:26:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.09110v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.09110v1,"math-ph, hep-th, math.MP"
Unification of Relativistic and Quantum Mechanics from Elementary Cycles   Theory,Donatello Dolce,"In Elementary Cycles theory elementary quantum particles are consistently described as the manifestation of ultra-fast relativistic spacetime cyclic dynamics, classical in the essence. The peculiar relativistic geometrodynamics of Elementary Cycles theory yields de facto a unification of ordinary relativistic and quantum physics. In particular its classical-relativistic cyclic dynamics reproduce exactly from classical physics first principles all the fundamental aspects of Quantum Mechanics, such as all its axioms, the Feynman path integral, the Dirac quantisation prescription (second quantisation), quantum dynamics of statistical systems, non-relativistic quantum mechanics, atomic physics, superconductivity, graphene physics and so on. Furthermore the theory allows for the explicit derivation of gauge interactions, without postulating gauge invariance, directly from relativistic geometrodynamical transformations, in close analogy with the description of gravitational interaction in general relativity. In this paper we summarise some of the major achievements, rigorously proven also in several recent peer-reviewed papers, of this innovative formulation of quantum particle physics.",2016-06-06T20:09:36Z,2016-06-06T20:09:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01918v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01918v1,physics.gen-ph
Flavor Constraints on New Physics,Zoltan Ligeti,"This talk highlights, from a theoretical point of view, some recent exciting results in flavor physics, as well as future prospects. We discuss possible implications of a subset of the experimental results in tension with the standard model, such as the $4\sigma$ deviation in the $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\bar\nu$ decay rates, and recent improvements in the constraints on axion portal dark matter models. We use the examples of constraining new physics contributions to neutral meson mixing and the search for possible vector-like fermions to illustrate the expected progress over the next decade to increase the sensitivity to new physics at shorter distance scales.

Various different new physics operators and their coupling strengths, which provide a good fit to $R_D$, $R_{D^*}$ and $q^2$ spectra, were identfied previously. In this work, we try to find angular observables in $\bar{B} \to D^* \tau \bar{\nu}$ which enable us to distinguish between these new physics operators. We find that the $D^*$ polarization fraction $f_L(q^2)$ is a good discriminant of scalar and tensor new physics operators.

Use of Topology in physical problems,Somendra M Bhattacharjee,"Some of the basic concepts of topology are explored through known physics problems.

The problems discussed are taken from classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, solid state physics, and biology (DNA), to emphasize some unity in diverse areas of physics. It is the real Euclidean space, $R^d$, with which we are most familiar. Intuitions can therefore be sharpened by appealing to the relevant features of this known space, and by using these as simplest examples to illustrate the abstract topological concepts.

The nanophysics age and its new perspectives,E. Catalano,"The nanophysics is halfway between the size scales of quantum mechanics and macroscopic physics governed by the laws of Newton and Einstein. The correct definition of nanophysics is the physics of structures and artefacts with dimensions in the nanometer range or of phenomena occurring in nanoseconds. Modern physical methods whose fundamental are developed in physics laboratories have become critically important in nanoscience. Nanophysics brings together multiple disciplines, using theoretical and experimental methods to determine the physical properties of materials in the nanoscale size range. Interesting properties include the structural, electronic, optical, and thermal behavior of nanomaterials, electrical and thermal conductivity, the forces between nanoscale objects, and the transition between classical and quantum behavior. Nanophysics has now become an independent branch of physics, simultaneously expanding into many new areas and playing a vital role in fields that were once the domain of engineering, chemical, or life sciences. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are all about relating and exploiting phenomena for materials having one, two or three dimensions reduced to the nanoscale. Breakthroughs in nanotechnology require a firm grounding in the principles of nanophysics. It is intended to fulfill a crucial purpose.

Learning A Physical Long-term Predictor,"Sebastien Ehrhardt, Aron Monszpart, Niloy J. Mitra, Andrea Vedaldi","Evolution has resulted in highly developed abilities in many natural intelligences to quickly and accurately predict mechanical phenomena. Humans have successfully developed laws of physics to abstract and model such mechanical phenomena. In the context of artificial intelligence, a recent line of work has focused on estimating physical parameters based on sensory data and use them in physical simulators to make long-term predictions. In contrast, we investigate the effectiveness of a single neural network for end-to-end long-term prediction of mechanical phenomena. Based on extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that such networks can outperform alternate approaches having even access to ground-truth physical simulators, especially when some physical parameters are unobserved or not known a-priori. Further, our network outputs a distribution of outcomes to capture the inherent uncertainty in the data. Our approach demonstrates for the first time the possibility of making actionable long-term predictions from sensor data without requiring to explicitly model the underlying physical laws.",2017-03-01T11:44:18Z,2017-03-01T11:44:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00247v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00247v1,"cs.AI, cs.NE"
Memristor equations: incomplete physics and undefined passivity/activity,"Kyle Sundqvist, David K. Ferry, Laszlo B. Kish","In his seminal paper, Chua presented a fundamental physical claim by introducing the memristor, ""The missing circuit element"". The memristor equations were originally supposed to represent a passive circuit element because, with active circuitry, arbitrary elements can be realized without limitations. Therefore, if the memristor equations do not guarantee that the circuit element can be realized by a passive system, the fundamental physics claim about the memristor as ""missing circuit element"" loses all its weight. The question of passivity/activity belongs to physics thus we incorporate thermodynamics into the study of this problem. We show that the memristor equations are physically incomplete regarding the problem of passivity/activity. As a consequence, the claim that the present memristor functions describe a passive device lead to unphysical results, such as violating the Second Law of thermodynamics, in infinitely large number of cases. The seminal memristor equations cannot introduce a new physical circuit element without making the model more physical such as providing the Fluctuation Dissipation Theory of memristors.",2017-03-23T14:18:59Z,2017-08-25T13:10:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09064v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09064v4,cs.ET

New Weak-Scale Physics from SO(10) with High-Scale Supersymmetry,"Sebastian A. R. Ellis, Tony Gherghetta, Kunio Kaneta, Keith A.

Putting aside questions of naturalness, supersymmetry might only be realised in nature at very high energy scales. If this is the case, the preservation of gauge coupling unification and the stability of the Higgs vacuum would certainly require new physics, but it need not necessarily be at weak scale energies. New physics near the unification scale could in principle ensure Grand Unification, while new physics below $\mu \sim 10^{10}$ GeV could ensure the stability of the Higgs vacuum. Surprisingly however, we find that in the context of a supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory, gauge coupling unification and the Higgs vacuum stability, when taken in conjunction with existing phenomenological constraints, require the presence of $\mathcal{O}$(TeV)-scale physics. This weak-scale physics takes the form of a complex scalar SU(2)$_L$ triplet with zero hypercharge, originating from the $\mathbf{210}$ of SO(10).",2018-07-17T15:14:04Z,2018-07-17T15:14:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06488v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06488v1,hep-ph

Different physical effects are anticipated in the two scenarios especially when the two systems have widely different masses. Here we show that for any superposed amplitudes that are related by a symmetry transformation, the above scenarios are physically equivalent: probabilities for any measurement are the same whether we assign the superposition state to system A or to system B. More generally, linearity of quantum theory guarantees that if a theory is invariant under some symmetry transformations it is necessarily also invariant under their arbitrary `superpositions'. Thus the notion of a superposition turns out to be relative to the choice of coordinates, once it is realised that relations between coordinates do not need to be classical.",2018-09-13T14:48:55Z,2018-09-13T14:48:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04999v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04999v1,"quant-ph, gr-qc"
Novel physics arising from phase transitions in biology,"Chiu Fan Lee, Jean David Wurtz","Phase transitions, such as the freezing of water and the magnetisation of a ferromagnet upon lowering the ambient temperature, are familiar physical phenomena. Interestingly, such a collective change of behaviour at a phase transition is also of importance to living systems. From cytoplasmic organisation inside a cell to the collective migration of cell tissue during organismal development and wound healing, phase transitions have emerged as key mechanisms underlying many crucial biological processes. However, a living system is fundamentally different from a thermal system, with driven chemical reactions (e.g., metabolism) and motility being two hallmarks of its nonequilibrium nature. In this review, we will discuss how driven chemical reactions can arrest universal coarsening kinetics expected from thermal phase separation, and how motility leads to the emergence of a novel universality class when the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken in an incompressible fluid.",2018-09-28T16:07:38Z,2018-09-28T16:07:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11117v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.11117v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech"
On the relationship of energy and probability in models of classical   statistical physics,"S Dachian, B Nahapetian","In this paper we present a new point of view on the mathematical foundations of statistical physics of infinite volume systems. This viewpoint is based on the newly introduced notions of transition energy function, transition energy field and one-point transition energy field. The former of them, namely the transition energy function, is a generalization of the notion of relative Hamiltonian introduced by Pirogov and Sinai. However, unlike the (relative) Hamiltonian, our objects are defined axiomatically by their natural and physically well-founded intrinsic properties. The developed approach allowed us to give a proper mathematical definition of the Hamiltonian without involving the notion of potential, to propose a justification of the Gibbs formula for infinite systems and to answer the problem stated by D. Ruelle of how wide the class of specifications, which can be represented in Gibbsian form, is. Furthermore, this approach establishes a straightforward relationship between the probabilistic notion of (Gibbs) random field and the physical notion of (transition) energy, and so opens the possibility to directly apply probabilistic methods to the mathematical problems of statistical physics.",2018-10-12T07:52:02Z,2019-09-12T12:08:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05388v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05388v4,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP"
G$_{2}$-Manifolds and M-Theory Compactifications,Aaron Kennon,"The mathematical features of a string theory compactification determine the physics of the effective four-dimensional theory. For this reason, understanding the mathematical structure of the possible compactification spaces is of profound importance. It is well established that the compactification space for M-Theory must be a seven-manifold with holonomy $G_{2}$, but much else remains to be understood regarding how to achieve a physically-realistic effective theory from such a compactification. Much also remains unknown about the mathematics of these $G_{2}$-Manifolds, as they are quite difficult to construct. This review discusses progress with regards to both the mathematical and physical considerations surrounding spaces of holonomy $G_{2}$. Special attention is given to the known constructions of $G_{2}$-Manifolds and the physics of their corresponding M-Theory compactifications.",2018-10-30T11:17:20Z,2018-10-31T04:08:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12659v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12659v2,"hep-th, math-ph, math.DG, math.MP"
Neutrinos and Particle Physics Models,Pierre Ramond,"As in Greek mythology, the neutrino was born in the mind of Wolfgang Pauli to salvage a fundamental principle. Its existence met with universal skepticism by a scientific community used to infer particles from experiment. Its detection in 1956 brought particle physics acceptance; its chirality explained maximal parity violation in $\beta$ decay; its (apparent) masslessness led theorists to imagine new symmetries. Neutrinos are pioneers of mutli-messenger astronomy, from the Sun, from SNA1987, and now through IceCube's blazar. The discovery of neutrino masses opened a new era in particle physics aswell as unexplored windows on the universe. -Tiny neutrino masses suggest new physics at very short distances through the Seesaw. - Neutrinos and quarks, unified by gauge structure, display different mass and mixing patterns: small quark mixing angles and two large neutrino mixing angles. This difference in mass and mixings in the midst of gauge unification may be an important clue towards Yukawa unification. - Neutrino mixings provide a new source of CP-violation, and may solve the riddle of matter-antimatter asymmetry.

Although in these preliminary studies the quark masses are still set to larger than the physical values, a few results at the physical point can still be deduced from simple extrapolations in the quark masses. The progress paves the road towards obtaining several important quantities in nuclear physics, such as nuclear forces and nuclear matrix elements relevant for pp fusion, single and double-beta decay processes, neutrino-nucleus scattering, searches for CP violation, nuclear response in direct dark-matter detection experiments, as well as gluonic structure of nuclei for an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) program.

Interacting two-particle states in the symmetric phase of the chiral   Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model,"A. Jakovac, A. Patkos","The renormalisation group flow of the chiral Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with one fermion flavor is mapped out in the symmetric phase with the help of the Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) method using a physically motivated non-local trial effective action. The well-known infrared unstable strongly coupled fixed point characterized by a set of pointlike four-fermion couplings is reproduced. The Gaussian infrared end-point of the flow of the four-fermion couplings is now accompanied by non-zero limiting composite couplings characteristic for interacting two-particle states with finite energy and physical size. The negative interaction energy of the constituents is extracted as a function of the physical size of the composite object. This function reaches a minimum in the accessible range of physical sizes, mildly depending on the set of initial values of the couplings. The propagation of a two-particle state minimizing the interaction energy has a natural bound state interpretation.",2019-02-18T10:13:36Z,2020-06-09T15:40:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06492v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06492v2,"hep-th, hep-ph"

On the Physical Meaning of Time-Domain Constitutive Models with Complex   Parameters,Nicos Makris,"This paper revisits the physical meaning of linear, time-domain constitutive models with complex parameters that have been presented in the literature and concludes that such models are not physically realizable. While complex-parameter phenomenological models (including those with complex-order time derivatives) may be efficient in capturing in the frequency domain the frequency-dependent behavior of viscoelastic materials over a finite frequency band, they do not possess physically acceptable time-response functions. The paper first reviews the intimate relation between the causality of a physically realizable constitutive model and the analyticity of its frequency-response function and explains that in theory it is sufficient to conduct a nonlinear regression analysis for estimating the model parameters either on only the real part or on only the imaginary part of its frequency-response function, given that they are related with the Hilbert transform. Consequently, the resulting model-parameters are real-valued; therefore, there is no theoretical justification to conduct the nonlinear regression analysis for estimating the model parameters in the complex space. The paper concludes with an example by showing that the relaxation modulus of the complex-coefficient Maxwell model is a divergent function at all positive times; therefore it is not a physically realizable constitutive model.",2019-10-16T14:17:48Z,2019-10-16T14:17:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08403v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08403v1,physics.class-ph

Learning-Assisted Secure End-to-End Network Slicing for Cyber-Physical   Systems,"Qiang Liu, Tao Han, Nirwan Ansari","There is a pressing need to interconnect physical systems such as power grid and vehicles for efficient management and safe operations. Owing to the diverse features of physical systems, there is hardly a one-size-fits-all networking solution for developing cyber-physical systems. Network slicing is a promising technology that allows network operators to create multiple virtual networks on top of a shared network infrastructure. These virtual networks can be tailored to meet the requirements of different cyber-physical systems. However, it is challenging to design secure network slicing solutions that can efficiently create end-to-end network slices for diverse cyber-physical systems.

The BESIII Physics Programme,"Chang-Zheng Yuan, Stephen Lars Olsen","The standard model of particle physics is a well-tested theoretical framework, but there are still a number of issues that deserve further experimental and theoretical investigation. For quark physics, such questions include: the nature of quark confinement, the mechanism that connects the quarks and gluons of the standard model theory to the strongly interacting particles; and the weak decays of quarks, which may provide insights into new physics mechanisms responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. These issues are addressed by the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) experiment at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider II (BEPCII) storage ring, which for the past decade has been studying particles produced in electron-positron collisions in the tau-charm energy-threshold region, and has by now accumulated the world's largest datasets that enables searches for nonstandard hadrons, weak decays of the charmed particles, and new physics phenomena beyond the standard model.

Contemplating electromagnetic phenomena in lived experience through   somatic meditation,"Zosia Krusberg, Andrew Feldman, Elam Coalson","One of the objectives of the undergraduate physics curriculum is for students to become aware of the connections between formal physical principles and personal experience. However, research has shown that awareness of connections between the abstract and the experiential tends to deteriorate, sometimes significantly, following instruction in undergraduate physics courses. Although this phenomenon has been discussed extensively in the literature, few pedagogical interventions have been designed or implemented to address this particular weakness in undergraduate physics instruction. In this work, we show that a contemplative practice consisting of a somatic meditation and a contemplation deepens students' awareness of the connections between formal physical principles and personal experience by deliberately drawing their attention to electromagnetic phenomena in their surroundings. In this process, students also note interdisciplinary connections between electrodynamic principles and chemical and biological systems. We also find that the contemplative practice awakens an intrinsic motivation to understand electromagnetic theory, as well as an appreciation for the somatic, affective, and cognitive benefits of a contemplative practice.",2020-01-23T16:59:15Z,2022-06-04T13:28:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08661v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08661v2,physics.ed-ph

We also provide a simple and intuitive explanation for the fundamental reasons behind the success of modern machine learning, as well as an introduction to the concurrent machine learning framework needed for integrating machine learning with physics-based modeling.

We explore the limitations of this program, and identify the measurement of $|V_{cb}|$ as one of the key ingredients in which progress beyond current expectations is necessary to maximize future sensitivity. We speculate on possible solutions to this bottleneck. Given the current tension with the standard model (SM) in semileptonic $B$ decays, we explore how its resolution may impact the search for new physics in mixing.

Are quantum spins but small perturbations of ontological Ising spins?,Hans-Thomas Elze,"The dynamics-from-permutations of classical Ising spins is generalized here for an arbitrarily long chain. This serves as an ontological model with discrete dynamics generated by pairwise exchange interactions defining the unitary update operator. The model incorporates a finite signal velocity and resembles in many aspects a discrete free field theory. We deduce the corresponding Hamiltonian operator and show that it generates an exact terminating Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Motivation for this study is provided by the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. We find that our ontological model, which is classical and deterministic, appears as if of quantum mechanical kind in an appropriate formal description. However, it is striking that (in principle arbitrarily) small deformations of the model turn it into a genuine quantum theory.

In this manuscript we perform a detailed analysis of the publicly available COHERENT CsI data making use of all available background data. We point out that Wilks' theorem is not fulfilled in general and a calculation of the confidence regions via Monte Carlo simulations following a Feldman-Cousins procedure is necessary. As an example for the necessity of this approach to test new physics scenarios we quantify the allowed ranges for several scenarios with neutrino non-standard interactions.

Exploring New Physics in $B \rightarrow πK$ Decays,Eleftheria Malami,"B-meson decays play an important role in flavour physics. The $B \rightarrow \pi K$ decays are dominated by QCD loop diagrams (penguins) but also electroweak penguins, where New Physics may enter, have a significant impact on the decay amplitude. Since measurements from B-factories indicate deviations from the Standard Model picture, we perform a state-of-the-art analysis to explore the correlation of the CP asymmetries and to get an updated picture. We propose a strategy for the optimal determination of the parameters which describe electroweak penguin effects and apply it to current data, utilising both neutral and charged $B \rightarrow \pi K$ decays.

We focused on 18 activities, including maintaining lab notebooks, fabricating parts, and asking others for help. Interviewees identified activities related to project execution as intrinsic to experimental physics practice based on high prevalence of those activities in interviewees' own projects. Fabrication-oriented activities were identified as conditional features of experimentation based on differences between projects, which interviewees attributed to variations in project resources. Interpersonal activities were also viewed as conditional features of experimentation, dependent upon one's status as novice or expert.

Svendsen, Jordi Cortés-Andrés, Álvaro Moreno-Martínez, Adrián Pérez-Suay, Jose Adsuara, Irene Martín, Maria Piles, Jordi Muñoz-Marí, Luca Martino","Most problems in Earth sciences aim to do inferences about the system, where accurate predictions are just a tiny part of the whole problem. Inferences mean understanding variables relations, deriving models that are physically interpretable, that are simple parsimonious, and mathematically tractable. Machine learning models alone are excellent approximators, but very often do not respect the most elementary laws of physics, like mass or energy conservation, so consistency and confidence are compromised. In this paper, we describe the main challenges ahead in the field, and introduce several ways to live in the Physics and machine learning interplay: to encode differential equations from data, constrain data-driven models with physics-priors and dependence constraints, improve parameterizations, emulate physical models, and blend data-driven and process-based models.

On Choosing a Physically Meaningful Topological Classification for   Non-Hermitian Systems and the Issue of Diagonalizability,Max Lein,"The topological classification of hermitian operators is solely determined by the presence or absence of certain discrete symmetries. For non-hermitian operators we in addition need to specify the type of spectral gap. They come in the flavor of a point gap or a line gap. Since the presence of a line gap implies the existence of a point gap, there is usually more than one mathematical classification applicable to a physical system. That raises the question: which of these gap-type classifications is physically meaningful?   To decide this question, I propose a simple criterion, namely the choice of physically relevant states. This generalizes the notion of Fermi projection that plays a crucial role in the topological classification of fermionic condensed matter systems, and enters as an auxiliary quantity in the bulk classification of photonic and magnonic crystals. After that the classification is entirely algorithmic, the system's topology is encoded in (pairs of) projections with symmetries and constraints. A crucial point in my investigation is the relevance of diagonalizability. Even for existing topological classifications of non-hermitian systems diagonalizability needs to be assumed to ensure that continuous deformations of the hamiltonian lead to continuous deformations of the spectra, projections and unitaries.",2020-10-19T07:07:52Z,2020-10-19T07:07:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09261v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09261v1,"cond-mat.mes-hall, math-ph, math.MP"
Vector Bosons and Jets in Proton Collisions,"Alessandro Tricoli, Marek Schönherr, Paolo Azzurri","Events with vector bosons produced in association with jets have been extensively studied at hadron colliders and provide high-accuracy tests of the Standard Model. A good understanding of these processes is of paramount importance for precision Higgs physics, as well as for searches for new physics. In particular, associated production of $\gamma$, $W$ or $Z$ bosons with light-flavor and heavy-flavor jets is a powerful tool for testing perturbative QCD calculations, Monte Carlo event generators, and can also constrain the parametrizations used to describe the parton content of the proton. Furthermore, events with a $W$ or $Z$ boson produced with two well-separated jets can be used to distinguish between electroweak and strong production mechanisms, and to set limits on contributions of physics beyond the Standard Model.

Gravitational waves physics using Fermi coordinates: a new teaching   perspective,Matteo Luca Ruggiero,"The detection of gravitational waves is possible thanks to a multidisciplinary approach, involving different disciplines such as astrophysics, physics, engineering and quantum optics. Consequently, it is important today for teachers to introduce the basic features of gravitational waves science in the undergraduate curriculum. The usual approach to gravitational wave physics is based on the use of traceless and transverse coordinates, which do not have a direct physical meaning and, in a teaching perspective, may cause misconceptions. In this paper, using Fermi coordinates, which are simply related to observable quantities, we show that it is possible to introduce a gravitoelectromagnetic analogy that describes the action of gravitational waves on test masses in terms of electric-like and magnetic-like forces. We suggest that this approach could be more suitable when introducing the basic principles of gravitational waves physics to students.",2021-01-17T18:37:32Z,2021-01-17T18:37:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06746v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06746v1,gr-qc
Hard Encoding of Physics for Learning Spatiotemporal Dynamics,"Chengping Rao, Hao Sun, Yang Liu","Modeling nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamical systems has primarily relied on partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the explicit formulation of PDEs for many underexplored processes, such as climate systems, biochemical reaction and epidemiology, remains uncertain or partially unknown, where very limited measurement data is yet available. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that forcibly encodes known physics knowledge to facilitate learning in a data-driven manner. The coercive encoding mechanism of physics, which is fundamentally different from the penalty-based physics-informed learning, ensures the network to rigorously obey given physics. Instead of using nonlinear activation functions, we propose a novel elementwise product operation to achieve the nonlinearity of the model. Numerical experiment demonstrates that the resulting physics-encoded learning paradigm possesses remarkable robustness against data noise/scarcity and generalizability compared with some state-of-the-art models for data-driven modeling.",2021-05-02T21:40:39Z,2021-05-02T21:40:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00557v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00557v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, physics.comp-ph"

The lattice results are obtained in the fixed scale approach from simulations of $N_f=2+1+1$ flavours of Wilson fermions at maximal twist. We identify an order parameter free from the the linear contributions in mass due to additive renormalization and regular terms in the Equation of State, which proves useful for the assessment of the hypothesized universal behaviour. We find compatibility with the 3D $O(4)$ universality class for the physical pion mass and temperatures $120$ MeV $ \lesssim T \lesssim 300$ MeV. We discuss violation of scaling at larger masses and a possible cross-over to mean field behaviour. The chiral extrapolation $T_0 = 134^{+6}_{-4}$ MeV of the pseudocritical temperature is robust against predictions of different universality classes and consistent with its estimate from the $O(4)$ Equation of State for the physical pion mass.",2021-05-20T15:40:32Z,2021-10-22T10:52:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09842v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09842v2,"hep-lat, hep-ph, hep-th"

In this paper we discuss the sense in which gauge symmetry can be fruitfully applied to constrain the space of possible dynamical models in such a way that forces and charges are appropriately coupled. We review the most well-known application of this kind, known as the 'gauge argument' or 'gauge principle', discuss its difficulties, and then reconstruct the gauge argument as a valid theorem in quantum theory. We then present what we take to be a better and more general gauge argument, based on Noether's second theorem in classical Lagrangian field theory, and argue that this provides a more appropriate framework for understanding how gauge symmetry helps to constrain the dynamics of physical theories.",2021-05-24T08:39:20Z,2021-05-24T08:39:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11154v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11154v1,"physics.hist-ph, math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph, 70S15, 81T13"

Within a Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) approach, we find that scattering amplitudes sourced by effective operators saturate perturbative unitarity at about 1 PeV. This corresponds to the highest energy scale that needs to be probed in order to resolve the new physics origin of the muon $g-2$ anomaly. On the other hand, simplified models (e.g.~scalar-fermion Yukawa theories) in which renormalizable couplings are pushed to the boundary of perturbativity still imply new on-shell states below 200 TeV.

State-of-the-art techniques are required to develop models that can capture the complexity of ocean currents and temperature flows. This work explores the benefits of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations related to ocean modeling; such as the Burgers, wave, and advection-diffusion equations. We explore the trade-offs of using data vs. physical models in PINNs for solving partial differential equations. PINNs account for the deviation from physical laws in order to improve learning and generalization.

Automated Malware Design for Cyber Physical Systems,Ashraf Tantawy,"The design of attacks for cyber physical systems is critical to assess CPS resilience at design time and run-time, and to generate rich datasets from testbeds for research. Attacks against cyber physical systems distinguish themselves from IT attacks in that the main objective is to harm the physical system. Therefore, both cyber and physical system knowledge are needed to design such attacks. The current practice to generate attacks either focuses on the cyber part of the system using IT cyber security existing body of knowledge, or uses heuristics to inject attacks that could potentially harm the physical process. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to automatically generate integrity attacks from the CPS safety and control specifications, without knowledge of the physical system or its dynamics. The generated attacks violate the system operational and safety requirements, hence present a genuine test for system resilience. We present an algorithm to automate the malware payload development.

Physics-informed regularization and structure preservation for learning   stable reduced models from data with operator inference,"Nihar Sawant, Boris Kramer, Benjamin Peherstorfer","Operator inference learns low-dimensional dynamical-system models with polynomial nonlinear terms from trajectories of high-dimensional physical systems (non-intrusive model reduction). This work focuses on the large class of physical systems that can be well described by models with quadratic nonlinear terms and proposes a regularizer for operator inference that induces a stability bias onto quadratic models. The proposed regularizer is physics informed in the sense that it penalizes quadratic terms with large norms and so explicitly leverages the quadratic model form that is given by the underlying physics. This means that the proposed approach judiciously learns from data and physical insights combined, rather than from either data or physics alone. Additionally, a formulation of operator inference is proposed that enforces model constraints for preserving structure such as symmetry and definiteness in the linear terms. Numerical results demonstrate that models learned with operator inference and the proposed regularizer and structure preservation are accurate and stable even in cases where using no regularization or Tikhonov regularization leads to models that are unstable.",2021-07-06T13:15:54Z,2021-07-06T13:15:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02597v1,"math.NA, cs.LG, cs.NA, math.OC"
Transforming the Preparation of Physics GTAs: Curriculum Development,"Emily Alicea-Muñoz, Carol Subiño Sullivan, Michael F.

Given the potentially large impact GTAs can have on undergraduate student learning, it is important to provide them with appropriate preparation for teaching. But GTAs are students themselves, and not all of them desire to pursue an academic career. Fully integrating GTA preparation into the professional development of graduate students lowers the barrier to engagement so that all graduate students may benefit from the opportunity to explore teaching and its applications to many potential career paths. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a GTA Preparation course for first-year Ph.D. students at the Georgia Tech School of Physics. Through a yearly cycle of implementation and revision, guided by the 3P Framework we developed (Pedagogy, Physics, Professional Development), the course has evolved into a robust and comprehensive professional development program that is well-received by physics graduate students.",2021-09-01T03:37:30Z,2021-09-01T03:37:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00168v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00168v1,physics.ed-ph
Self-normalizing Path Integrals,"I. M. Burbano, Francisco Calderón","The normalization in the path integral approach to quantum field theory, in contrast with statistical field theory, can contain physical information. The main claim of this paper is that the inner product on the space of field configurations, one of the fundamental pieces of data required to be added to quantize a classical field theory, determines the normalization of the path integral. In fact, dimensional analysis shows that the introduction of this structure necessarily introduces a scale that is left unfixed by the classical theory. We study the dependence of the theory on this scale. This allows us to explore mechanisms that can be used to fix the normalization based on cutting and gluing different integrals. ""Self-normalizing"" path integrals, those independent of the scale, play an important role in this process. Furthermore, we show that the scale dependence encodes other important physical data: we use it to give a conceptually clear derivation of the chiral anomaly.

The answer is simple, since modern physics is in general not present in the standard physics curricula, except for some general outlines, in the final years of some secondary schools. But, is it possibile to teach modern physics in primary school? Is it effective? And, also, is it engaging for students? These are the simple questions which stimulated our research, based on an intervention performed in the last year of Italian primary school, focused on teaching gravity, according to the Einsteinian approach in the spirit of the Einstein First project, an international collaboration which aims to teach school age children the concepts of modern physics. The outcomes of our research study are in agreement with previous findings obtained in Australian schools, thus they contribute to validate them and show that there is no cultural effect, since the approach works in different education systems.

Stochastic Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations,"Jared O'Leary, Joel A. Paulson, Ali Mesbah","Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are used to describe a wide variety of complex stochastic dynamical systems. Learning the hidden physics within SDEs is crucial for unraveling fundamental understanding of these systems' stochastic and nonlinear behavior. We propose a flexible and scalable framework for training artificial neural networks to learn constitutive equations that represent hidden physics within SDEs. The proposed stochastic physics-informed neural ordinary differential equation framework (SPINODE) propagates stochasticity through the known structure of the SDE (i.e., the known physics) to yield a set of deterministic ODEs that describe the time evolution of statistical moments of the stochastic states. SPINODE then uses ODE solvers to predict moment trajectories. SPINODE learns neural network representations of the hidden physics by matching the predicted moments to those estimated from data. Recent advances in automatic differentiation and mini-batch gradient descent with adjoint sensitivity are leveraged to establish the unknown parameters of the neural networks. We demonstrate SPINODE on three benchmark in-silico case studies and analyze the framework's numerical robustness and stability.

Connecting lattice Boltzmann methods to physical reality by   coarse-graining Molecular Dynamics simulations,"Aleksandra Pachalieva, Alexander J. Wagner","The success of lattice Boltzmann methods has been attributed to their mesoscopic nature as a method derivable from a physically consistent microscopic model. Original lattice Boltzmann methods were Boltzmann averages of an underlying lattice gas. In the transition to modern lattice Boltzmann method, this link was broken, and the frequently used over-relaxation to achieve high Reynolds numbers has been seen as lacking physical motivation. While this approach has undeniable utility, it appeared to break the link to any underlying physical reality putting into question the special place of lattice Boltzmann methods among fluid simulation methods. In this letter, we show that over-relaxation arises naturally from physical lattice gases that are derived as a coarse-graining of Molecular Dynamics simulations thereby re-affirming the firm foundation of lattice Boltzmann methods in physical reality.",2021-09-10T17:37:54Z,2021-09-22T19:17:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05009v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05009v3,physics.comp-ph

Noether charges: the link between empirical significance of symmetries   and non-separability,Henrique Gomes,"A fundamental tenet of gauge theory is that physical quantities should be gauge-invariant. This prompts the question: can gauge symmetries have physical significance? On one hand, the Noether theorems relate conserved charges to symmetries, endowing the latter with physical significance, though this significance is sometimes taken as indirect. But for theories in spatially finite and bounded regions, the standard Noether charges are not gauge-invariant. I here argue that gauge-\emph{variance} of charges is tied to the nature of the non-locality within gauge theories. I will flesh out these links by providing a chain of (local) implications: `local conservation laws'${\Rightarrow}$ `conserved regional charges' $\Leftrightarrow$ `non-separability' ${\Leftrightarrow}$ `direct empirical significance of symmetries'.",2021-10-14T08:14:47Z,2021-10-14T08:14:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07208v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07208v1,"physics.hist-ph, hep-ph, hep-th"

Particle physics facing a pandemic,"Adam Kardos, Sven-Olaf Moch, German Rodrigo","Our ordinary life changed quite a bit in March of 2020 due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. While spring time in general well awaited and regarded as a synonym for rejuvenation the spring of 2020 brought lock-down, curfew, home office and digital education to the lives of many. The particle physics community was not an exception: research institutes and universities introduced home office and digital lecturing and all workshops, conferences and summer schools were canceled, got postponed or took place online. Using publicly available data from the INSPIRE and arXiv databases we investigate the effects of this dramatic change of life to the publishing trends of the high-energy physics community with an emphasis on particle phenomenology and theory.

Estimation of Physical Activity Level and Ambient Condition Thresholds   for Respiratory Health using Smartphone Sensors,Chinazunwa Uwaoma,"While physical activity has been described as a primary prevention against chronic diseases, strenuous physical exertion under adverse ambient conditions has also been reported as a major contributor to exacerbation of chronic respiratory conditions. Maintaining a balance by monitoring the type and the level of physical activities of affected individuals, could help in reducing the cost and burden of managing respiratory ailments. This paper explores the potentiality of motion sensors in Smartphones to estimate physical activity thresholds that could trigger symptoms of exercise induced respiratory conditions (EiRCs). The focus is on the extraction of measurements from the embedded motion sensors to determine the activity level and the type of activity that is tolerable to individuals respiratory health. The calculations are based on the correlation between Signal Magnitude Area (SMA) and Energy Expenditure (EE). We also consider the effect of changes in the ambient conditions like temperature and humidity, as contributing factors to respiratory distress during physical exercise. Real time data collected from healthy individuals were used to demonstrate the potentiality of a mobile phone as tool to regulate the level of physical activities of individuals with EiRCs. We describe a practical situation where the experimental outcomes can be applied to promote good respiratory health.",2021-12-11T14:25:41Z,2021-12-11T14:25:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09068v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09068v1,"eess.SP, cs.LG"

The development of a novel approach to keywords co-occurrence analysis is the main point of the paper. In contrast to traditional co-keyword network analysis, we investigate structures that unite physics concepts in different documents and bind different documents with the same physics concepts.

Lessons from the LHCb measurement of CP violation in $B_s\to K^+K^-$,"Yosef Nir, Inbar Savoray, Yehonatan Viernik","The LHCb experiment measured the time-dependent CP asymmetries $C_{KK}$ and $S_{KK}$ in $B_s\to K^+K^-$ decay. Combining with the corresponding CP asymmetries $C_{\pi\pi}$ and $S_{\pi\pi}$ in $B\to \pi^+\pi^-$ decay, we find that the size of $U$-spin breaking in this system is of order $20\%$. Moreover, the data suggest that these effects are dominated by factorizable contributions. We further study the constraints on new physics contributions to $b\to u\bar uq$ ($q=s,d$). New physics that is minimally flavor violating (MFV) cannot be distinguished from the Standard Model (SM) in these decays. However, new physics that is not MFV can mimic large $U$-spin breaking. Requiring that the $U$-spin breaking parameters remain below the size implied by the data leads to a lower bound of $5-10$ TeV on the scale of generic new physics. If the new physics is subject to the selection rules that follow from the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism or from General Minimal Flavor Violation (GMFV), the bound is relaxed to 2 TeV.",2022-01-10T19:00:01Z,2022-02-13T15:05:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03573v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03573v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex"
How to Teach a Teacher: Challenges and Opportunities in Physics Teacher   Education in Germany and the USA,"Ben Van Dusen, Christoph Vogelsang, Joseph Taylor, Eva Cauet","Preparing future physics teachers for the demanding nature of their profession is an important and complex endeavor. Teacher education systems must provide a structure for the coherent professional development of prospective teachers. Worldwide, physics teacher education is organized in different ways, but have to face similar challenges, like the relation between academic studies and practical preparation. To meet these challenges, it is worth taking look at different teacher education systems. In this chapter, we compare physics teacher education in two countries, representing two different educational traditions: Germany and the USA. Comparing different aspects of physics teacher education (standards, organization and institutionalization, content of teacher education, quality assurance), we describe both systems in their current state and why they are organized in the way they are.

Learning to Simulate Unseen Physical Systems with Graph Neural Networks,"Ce Yang, Weihao Gao, Di Wu, Chong Wang","Simulation of the dynamics of physical systems is essential to the development of both science and engineering. Recently there is an increasing interest in learning to simulate the dynamics of physical systems using neural networks. However, existing approaches fail to generalize to physical substances not in the training set, such as liquids with different viscosities or elastomers with different elasticities. Here we present a machine learning method embedded with physical priors and material parameters, which we term as ""Graph-based Physics Engine"" (GPE), to efficiently model the physical dynamics of different substances in a wide variety of scenarios. We demonstrate that GPE can generalize to materials with different properties not seen in the training set and perform well from single-step predictions to multi-step roll-out simulations. In addition, introducing the law of momentum conservation in the model significantly improves the efficiency and stability of learning, allowing convergence to better models with fewer training steps.",2022-01-28T07:56:46Z,2022-01-28T07:56:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11976v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11976v1,cs.LG
On feedforward control using physics-guided neural networks: Training   cost regularization and optimized initialization,"Max Bolderman, Mircea Lazar, Hans Butler","Performance of model-based feedforward controllers is typically limited by the accuracy of the inverse system dynamics model. Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN), where a known physical model cooperates in parallel with a neural network, were recently proposed as a method to achieve high accuracy of the identified inverse dynamics. However, the flexible nature of neural networks can create overparameterization when employed in parallel with a physical model, which results in a parameter drift during training. This drift may result in parameters of the physical model not corresponding to their physical values, which increases vulnerability of the PGNN to operating conditions not present in the training data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a regularization method via identified physical parameters, in combination with an optimized training initialization that improves training convergence. The regularized PGNN framework is validated on a real-life industrial linear motor, where it delivers better tracking accuracy and extrapolation.",2022-01-28T12:51:25Z,2022-01-28T12:51:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12088v1,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Drawing from the flavour precision-LHC exotics search complementarity, we also provide a projection of the future sensitivity that can be achieved in light of currently available analyses. On the one hand, we find that the parameter space of the 2HDM can be explored significantly further with more data from the LHC with some complementarity with flavour physics. On the other hand, flavour physics results alongside their projections remain powerful tools to constrain the model space in regions where direct sensitivity to new states via exotics searches is lost. Our results further highlight the recently observed flavour physics anomalies as important drivers of new physics searches in the future; we also touch on implications for a strong first order electroweak phase transition.",2022-02-17T18:21:44Z,2022-02-17T18:21:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08807v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08807v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex"
Bond Graphs for multi-physics informed Neural Networks for multi-variate   time series,"Alexis-Raja Brachet, Pierre-Yves Richard, Céline Hudelot","In the trend of hybrid Artificial Intelligence techniques, Physical-Informed Machine Learning has seen a growing interest. It operates mainly by imposing data, learning, or architecture bias with simulation data, Partial Differential Equations, or equivariance and invariance properties. While it has shown great success on tasks involving one physical domain, such as fluid dynamics, existing methods are not adapted to tasks with complex multi-physical and multi-domain phenomena. In addition, it is mainly formulated as an end-to-end learning scheme. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach, together with Message Passing Graph Neural Networks. We propose a Neural Bond graph Encoder (NBgE) producing multi-physics-informed representations that can be fed into any task-specific model.

Enhanced Spatiotemporal Prediction Using Physical-guided And   Frequency-enhanced Recurrent Neural Networks,"Xuanle Zhao, Yue Sun, Tielin Zhang, Bo Xu","Spatiotemporal prediction plays an important role in solving natural problems and processing video frames, especially in weather forecasting and human action recognition. Recent advances attempt to incorporate prior physical knowledge into the deep learning framework to estimate the unknown governing partial differential equations (PDEs), which have shown promising results in spatiotemporal prediction tasks. However, previous approaches only restrict neural network architectures or loss functions to acquire physical or PDE features, which decreases the representative capacity of a neural network. Meanwhile, the updating process of the physical state cannot be effectively estimated. To solve the above mentioned problems, this paper proposes a physical-guided neural network, which utilizes the frequency-enhanced Fourier module and moment loss to strengthen the model's ability to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive second-order Runge-Kutta method with physical constraints to model the physical states more precisely. We evaluate our model on both spatiotemporal and video prediction tasks. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and performs best in several datasets, with a much smaller parameter count.",2024-05-23T12:39:49Z,2024-05-23T12:39:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14504v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14504v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"

On Laplace equation solution in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal   coordinates,Pavel Strunz,"Orthogonal coordinate systems enable expressing the boundary conditions of differential equations in accord with the physical boundaries of the problem. It can significantly simplify calculations. The orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies or particles with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. The interior solution of the Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates was recently found; however, the exterior solution was missing. The exterior solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates is derived. In the steps leading to this solution, important formulas of the SOS algebra are found. Various forms of the Laplace operator in the SOS coordinates in azimuthally symmetric case are shown. General transformation between two different SOS coordinate systems is derived. It is determined that the SOS harmonics are physically the same as the solid harmonics. Further, a formula expressing any generalized Legendre polynomial as a finite sum of monomials is found.

In this paper, a new physical quantity 'thermoelectrical potential' from the physical nature of the thermoelectric conversion is proposed. The quantity is expressed as the product of the Seebeck coefficient and the absolute temperature, i.e., ST. Based on the thermoelectrical potential, we clarify the conversion of the various forms of energy in the thermoelectric effect by presenting a clear physical picture. Results from the analysis of the physical mechanism of the Seebeck effect indicate that the thermoelectrical potential, rather than the temperature gradient field, exerts a force on the charge carriers in the thermoelectric material. Based on thermoelectric potential, the Peltier effects at different material interfaces can be macroscopically described. The Kelvin relation is rederived using the proposed quantity, which simplified the derivation process and elucidated the physical picture of the thermoelectrical conversion.",2024-09-13T13:51:17Z,2024-09-13T13:51:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08836v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08836v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.app-ph"
Physics-informed kernel learning,"Nathan Doumèche, Francis Bach, Gérard Biau, Claire Boyer","Physics-informed machine learning typically integrates physical priors into the learning process by minimizing a loss function that includes both a data-driven term and a partial differential equation (PDE) regularization. Building on the formulation of the problem as a kernel regression task, we use Fourier methods to approximate the associated kernel, and propose a tractable estimator that minimizes the physics-informed risk function. We refer to this approach as physics-informed kernel learning (PIKL). This framework provides theoretical guarantees, enabling the quantification of the physical prior's impact on convergence speed. We demonstrate the numerical performance of the PIKL estimator through simulations, both in the context of hybrid modeling and in solving PDEs. In particular, we show that PIKL can outperform physics-informed neural networks in terms of both accuracy and computation time. Additionally, we identify cases where PIKL surpasses traditional PDE solvers, particularly in scenarios with noisy boundary conditions.",2024-09-20T06:55:20Z,2024-09-20T06:55:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13786v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13786v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH"

Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics,"Sayantani Bhattacharyya, Sukanya Mitra, Shuvayu Roy, Rajeev Singh","In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.",2024-09-22T08:54:14Z,2025-01-27T12:26:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15387v3,"nucl-th, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th"
Disentangled Representation Learning for Parametric Partial Differential   Equations,"Ning Liu, Lu Zhang, Tian Gao, Yue Yu","Neural operators (NOs) have demonstrated remarkable success in learning mappings between function spaces, serving as efficient approximators for the forward solutions of complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, while effective as black-box solvers, they offer limited insight into the underlying physical mechanism, due to the lack of interpretable representations of the physical parameters that drive the system. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new paradigm for learning disentangled representations from neural operator parameters, thereby effectively solving an inverse problem. Specifically, we introduce DisentangO, a novel hyper-neural operator architecture designed to unveil and disentangle the latent physical factors of variation embedded within the black-box neural operator parameters. At the core of DisentangO is a multi-task neural operator architecture that distills the varying parameters of the governing PDE through a task-wise adaptive layer, coupled with a hierarchical variational autoencoder that disentangles these variations into identifiable latent factors. By learning these disentangled representations, our model not only enhances physical interpretability but also enables more robust generalization across diverse physical systems. Empirical evaluations across supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning contexts show that DisentangO effectively extracts meaningful and interpretable latent features, bridging the divide between predictive performance and physical understanding in neural operator frameworks.",2024-10-03T01:40:39Z,2024-10-03T01:40:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02136v1,cs.LG

"Modeling Brownian Motion as a Timelapse of the Physical, Persistent,   Trajectory",Ludovico Cademartiri,"While it is very common to model diffusion as a random walk by assuming memorylessness of the trajectory and diffusive step lengths, these assumptions can lead to significant errors. This paper describes the extent to which a physical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight. Analysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over collisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two observations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when the time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the distribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly smaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the combination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at short timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the underlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical trajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of the subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is several hundred times larger than the relaxation time. I discuss how to best account for this effect in computational approaches.",2024-10-31T17:00:18Z,2024-10-31T17:00:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24137v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24137v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.other, physics.chem-ph"

In the latter case, a deterministic time evolution of the local field algebra, necessary for field quantization, requires a reduction of the full local gauge group $\cal{G}$ to a residual local subgroup $\cal{G}_r$ satisfying suitable conditions. A non-trivial residual local gauge group allows for a description/construction of the physical states by using the vacuum representation of a local field algebra, otherwise precluded if $\cal{G}$ is reduced to the identity.

A physical basis for cosmological correlators from cuts,"Shounak De, Andrzej Pokraka","Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes.

Efficient on-shell matching,"Mikael Chala, Javier López Miras, José Santiago, Fuensanta Vilches","We propose an efficient method to perform on-shell matching calculations in effective field theories. The standard off-shell approach to matching requires the use of a Green's basis that includes redundant and evanescent operators. The reduction of such a basis to a physical one is often highly non-trivial, difficult to automate and error prone. Our proposal is based on a numerical solution of the corresponding on-shell matching equations, which automatically implements in a trivial way the delicate cancellation between the non-local terms in the full theory and those in the effective one. The use of rational on-shell kinematics ensures an exact analytic solution despite the numerical procedure. In this way we only need a physical basis to perform the matching. Our procedure can be used to reduce any Green's basis to an arbitrary physical one, or to translate between physical bases; to renormalize arbitrary effective Lagrangians, directly in terms of a physical basis; and to perform finite matching, including evanescent contributions, as we discuss with explicit examples.",2024-11-19T19:00:00Z,2024-11-19T19:00:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12798v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12798v1,"hep-ph, hep-th"
Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking,"Zhuo-Ting Cai, Hai-Dong Li, Wei Chen","Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet their underlying physical mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the ${PT}$ transition in two-level systems.

Natural Probability,Brett Parker,"How should we model an observer within quantum mechanics or quantum field theory? How can classical physics emerge from a quantum model, and why should classical probability be useful? How can we model a selective measurement entirely within a closed quantum system? This paper sketches a new physical theory of probability based on an attempt to model classical information within a purely quantum system. We model classical information using a version of Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism, with emphasis on quantum information encoded using projection operators localised in spacetime. This version of Quantum Darwinism is compatible with quantum field theory, and does not require any artificial division of a quantum system into subsystems. The main innovation is our attempt to provide a physical explanation of probability. Decoherence is the physical mechanism behind Quantum Darwinism or the `branching of quantum worlds'. Assuming a type of perfect decoherence we construct a conventional probabilistic model for classical information. This, however, is not our theory of natural probability, and does not quite demonstrate the validity of Bayesian reasoning. Instead, our theory of natural probability arises from careful consideration of errors in decoherence: roughly speaking, we don't observe low probability events because they are swamped by quantum noise.",2024-12-06T01:04:57Z,2024-12-06T01:04:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04689v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04689v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP, math.PR, 81Pxx, 60Axx"

However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements.

Microscopic imprints of learned solutions in adaptive resistor networks,"Marcel Guzman, Felipe Martins, Menachem Stern, Andrea J. Liu","In physical networks trained using supervised learning, physical parameters are adjusted to produce desired responses to inputs. An example is electrical contrastive local learning networks of nodes connected by edges that are resistors that adjust their conductances during training. When an edge conductance changes, it upsets the current balance of every node. In response, physics adjusts the node voltages to minimize the dissipated power. Learning in these systems is therefore a coupled double-optimization process, in which the network descends both a cost landscape in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, and a physical landscape -- the power -- in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. Because of this coupling, the physical landscape of a trained network contains information about the learned task. Here we demonstrate that all the physical information relevant to the trained input-output relation can be captured by a susceptibility, an experimentally measurable quantity. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations to show that the susceptibility is positively correlated with functional importance and that we can extract physical insight into how the system performs the task from the conductances of highly susceptible edges.",2024-12-26T21:36:23Z,2024-12-26T21:36:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19356v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19356v1,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech"

This breakthrough marks the dawn of a new field: collider neutrino physics. Further neutrino measurements at the LHC will offer novel opportunities to advance neutrino physics, constrain the strong interaction in uncharted kinematic regimes, provide critical input for addressing outstanding questions in astroparticle physics, and search for phenomena predicted by scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model. This proceeding reviews the existing and proposed neutrino detectors, presents their first results, and summarizes their physics potential.",2025-01-13T09:26:14Z,2025-01-13T09:26:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07152v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07152v1,hep-ph
Solar neutrinos,"Shaomin Chen, Xun-Jie Xu","Solar neutrinos, generated abundantly by thermonuclear reactions in the solar interior, offer a unique tool for studying astrophysics and particle physics. The observation of solar neutrinos has led to the discovery of neutrino oscillation, a topic currently under active research, and it has been recognized by two Nobel Prizes. In this pedagogical introduction to solar neutrino physics, we will guide readers through several key questions: How are solar neutrinos produced? How are they detected? What is the solar neutrino problem, and how is it resolved by neutrino oscillation? This article also presents a brief overview of the theory of solar neutrino oscillation, the experimental achievements, new physics relevant to solar neutrinos, and the prospects in this field.",2025-01-17T06:28:38Z,2025-01-17T06:28:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09971v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09971v1,"hep-ph, astro-ph.SR, hep-ex, nucl-ex"
Physics on manifolds with exotic differential structures,"Ulrich Chiapi-Ngamako, M. B. Paranjape","A given topological manifold can sometimes be endowed with inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers using inequivalent differential structures. Specifically, that means that one observer will say that this is a smooth function while the other observer will say it is not smooth. On the other hand, the notion of a continuous function is the same for both, defined by the common topology. In this paper, we examine the import of inequivalent differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation on the 7-sphere. The 7-sphere was the first, celebrated example, found by Milnor, of a topological manifold that can be endowed with a finite number, 28, of inequivalent differential structures. We find that the spectra of these operators are dependent on the choice of differential structure and hence the identical topological manifolds have different physical laws.",2025-01-23T02:18:07Z,2025-01-31T04:47:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13328v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13328v2,"hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"
Optimizers for Stabilizing Likelihood-free Inference,"G. Bruno De Luca, Benjamin Nachman, Eva Silverstein, Henry Zheng","A growing number of applications in particle physics and beyond use neural networks as unbinned likelihood ratio estimators applied to real or simulated data. Precision requirements on the inference tasks demand a high-level of stability from these networks, which are affected by the stochastic nature of training. We show how physics concepts can be used to stabilize network training through a physics-inspired optimizer. In particular, the Energy Conserving Descent (ECD) optimization framework uses classical Hamiltonian dynamics on the space of network parameters to reduce the dependence on the initial conditions while also stabilizing the result near the minimum of the loss function. We develop a version of this optimizer known as $ECD_{q=1}$, which has few free hyperparameters with limited ranges guided by physical reasoning. We apply $ECD_{q=1}$ to representative likelihood-ratio estimation tasks in particle physics and find that it out-performs the widely-used Adam optimizer. We expect that ECD will be a useful tool for wide array of data-limited problems, where it is computationally expensive to exhaustively optimize hyperparameters and mitigate fluctuations with ensembling.",2025-01-30T15:16:09Z,2025-01-30T15:16:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18419v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18419v1,"hep-ph, hep-th"
"B-Decay CP Asymmetries, Discrete Ambiguities and New Physics","B. Kayser, D. London","The first measurements of CP violation in the $B$ system will likely probe $\sin 2\alpha$, $\sin 2\beta$ and $\cos 2\gamma$. Assuming that the CP angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the interior angles of the unitarity triangle, these measurements determine the angle set $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ except for a twofold discrete ambiguity. If one allows for the possibility of new physics, the presence of this discrete ambiguity can make its discovery difficult: if only one of the two candidate solutions is consistent with constraints from other measurements in the $B$ and $K$ systems, one is not sure whether new physics is present or not. We review the methods used to resolve the discrete ambiguity and show that, even in the presence of new physics, they can usually be used to uncover this new physics. There are some exceptions, which we describe in detail. We systematically scan the parameter space and present examples of values of $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and the new-physics parameters which correspond to all possibilities. Finally, we show that if one relaxes the assumption that the bag parameters $\BBd$ and $\BK$ are positive, one can no longer definitively establish the presence of new physics.",1999-09-29T20:15:57Z,2000-01-29T20:49:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9909560v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9909560v2,hep-ph
The Physics of Beauty (& Charm [& $τ$]) at the LHC and in the Era of   the LHC,I. I. Bigi,"The recent successes of the SM do not weaken the arguments in favour of New Physics residing at the TeV scale. Finding and identifying it represents the prime challenge for a generation of high energy physicists. To differentiate between different scenarios of New Physics we need to analyze their impact on flavour dynamics. A continuing comprehensive program of heavy flavour studies instrumentalizing the high sensitivity of \cp analyses is intrinsically connected to LHC's core mission. In B decays we can typically expect no more than moderate deviations from SM predictions. $B_s$ transitions provide an {\em autonomous} access to New Physics not prejudiced by $\Delta M(B_s)|_{exp}\simeq \Delta M(B_s)|_{SM}$. Dedicated studies of charm and $\tau$ decays offer unique opportunities to observe New Physics. One challenge is whether LHCb will be able to exploit LHC's huge charm production rate to probe for \cp asymmetries. Likewise, to which degree ATLAS/CMS can contribute to $B$ physics and to searches for $\tau \to 3l$. Yet to saturate the discovery potential for New Physics in beauty, charm and $\tau$ decays we will need a comprehensive high quality data base that only a Super-Flavour Factory can provide.",2006-08-20T16:58:08Z,2006-08-20T16:58:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0608225v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0608225v1,hep-ph

Teotonio-Sobrinho","Conventional discrete approximations of a manifold do not preserve its nontrivial topological features. In this article we describe an approximation scheme due to Sorkin which reproduces physically important aspects of manifold topology with striking fidelity. The approximating topological spaces in this scheme are partially ordered sets (posets). Now, in ordinary quantum physics on a manifold $M$, continuous probability densities generate the commutative C*-algebra $\cc(M)$ of continuous functions on $M$. It has a fundamental physical significance, containing the information to reconstruct the topology of $M$, and serving to specify the domains of observables like the Hamiltonian. For a poset, the role of this algebra is assumed by a noncommutative C*-algebra $\ca $. As noncommutative geometries are based on noncommutative C*-algebras, we therefore have a remarkable connection between finite approximations to quantum physics and noncommutative geometries. Various methods for doing quantum physics using $\ca $ are explored. Particular attention is paid to developing numerically viable approximation schemes which at the same time preserve important topological features of continuum physics.",1994-03-11T01:32:09Z,1994-03-26T16:55:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9403067v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9403067v3,"hep-th, funct-an, gr-qc, hep-lat, math.FA"
Towards a necessary change in the mathematical principles of natural   philosophy,Mauricio Ayala,"Being mathematics a natural language to Mankind and to physics, it must be constantly adapted to our necessities and our natural perception. Then, mathematical concepts are not absolute to reality. Although mathematical theories are constructions of our mind, and the existence of objects in such theories is a matter of consistency or coherence of the theory (this allows us to study them independently of other theories), in physics its not enough that mathematical structures are coherent or consistent, these must have a much more tangible reference to reality. Therefore any mathematical model not necessarily is appropriate in physics. So, what sense has the concept of a point in physics, that elementary notion used to represent the objects of the reality.   If we consider that in a good model of reality, the existence of a mathematical object with a physical reference must be equivalent to the possibility of its construction, perception and verification of physical existence, where the refutaction of the non-existence of an object does not necessarily mean that it is possible to find a test of its existence. Then, one obtains that the mathematical language becomes richer in structures, where the point concept is replaced by more intuitive and perceivable concepts. On the one hand, this possibly can lead us to a physics without infinites, and without paradoxes, on the other hand, one restricts the use of mathematics and the use of mental experiments in physics.",2003-07-11T20:00:29Z,2003-07-11T20:00:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0307063v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0307063v1,physics.gen-ph
Remarks on the relation between physics and faith,Horst R. Beyer,"It is a quite common view among people, that are not aware of the developments in modern physics, that it is part of human nature to substitute religious faith in places where there is no knowledge. Therefore, an increase in knowledge would lead to a decrease in the necessity of faith. Further, it is argued that, ideally speaking, a full knowledge of the laws of nature would make obsolete any sort of religious faith and would ultimately allow a complete control of nature by man. Since referring to nature, such views must be founded in the natural sciences of which physics is the most fundamental. Therefore, the question whether such views are compatible with the current state of natural sciences is ultimately decided in physics. Indeed, it is likely that these simplistic views have their origin in the world view generated by the successes of Newtonian physics from the middle of the 17th century until the beginning of the 20th century which viewed the physical world as a type of mechanical clock in which the motion of the gears affect each other in a precise and predictable way. In particular, the paper points out that the above views are no longer supported by current physics and that abstracted world views cannot be considered as part of natural sciences, but only as belief systems.",2006-11-10T16:36:22Z,2006-11-10T16:36:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0611106v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0611106v1,"physics.hist-ph, physics.soc-ph"
Towards a Coherent Theory of Physics and Mathematics,Paul Benioff,"As an approach to a Theory of Everything a framework for developing a coherent theory of mathematics and physics together is described. The main characteristic of such a theory is discussed: the theory must be valid and and sufficiently strong, and it must maximally describe its own validity and sufficient strength. The mathematical logical definition of validity is used, and sufficient strength is seen to be a necessary and useful concept. The requirement of maximal description of its own validity and sufficient strength may be useful to reject candidate coherent theories for which the description is less than maximal. Other aspects of a coherent theory discussed include universal applicability, the relation to the anthropic principle, and possible uniqueness. It is suggested that the basic properties of the physical and mathematical universes are entwined with and emerge with a coherent theory. Support for this includes the indirect reality status of properties of very small or very large far away systems compared to moderate sized nearby systems. Discussion of the necessary physical nature of language includes physical models of language and a proof that the meaning content of expressions of any axiomatizable theory seems to be independent of the algorithmic complexity of the theory. G\""{o}del maps seem to be less useful for a coherent theory than for purely mathematical theories because all symbols and words of any language musthave representations as states of physical systems already in the domain of a coherent theory.",2002-01-21T21:20:48Z,2002-05-02T16:35:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201093v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0201093v2,"quant-ph, hep-th"
State Vectors and Physical States,William N. Watson,"Causality and the relativity of simultaneity seem at odds with the apparently sudden, acausal state-vector changes (""collapses"") characteristic of quantum phenomena. The problem of how physical phenomena can be causally determined, have the probabilities predicted by quantum theory, and be consistent with special relativity appears to be solved by the assumption, essentially the same as one first used by Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz to address a different problem, that the ""initial"" and ""final"" state vectors of a phenomenon or observation, along with certain other state vectors, all represent the system's state at all times. Each member of such an aggregate of state vectors is postulated to represent a different aspect of a physical state rather than a state, so that most of the state vectors in effect constitute a set of nonlocal hidden variables. Various implications of this assumption are illustrated through several physical situations. Among the results is a somewhat surprising resolution of a paradox in a three-spin Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger experiment (a ""three-particle EPR"" experiment), which involves a logical consequence that differs from familiar ideas of quantum physics that has no practical experimental consequence, and the prediction of new experimental phenomena related to the Zou-Wang-Mandel superposed-idler system. The potential value of the concepts described as heuristics for new predictions and for developing physical intuition by clarifying the interrelation and coherence of physical principles that would otherwise seem contradictory is briefly discussed.",2002-05-23T01:42:19Z,2002-05-23T01:42:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205141v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0205141v1,quant-ph
A Topos Foundation for Theories of Physics: I. Formal Languages for   Physics,"A. Doering, C. J. Isham","This paper is the first in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories of space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when the topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different topos. In this paper we discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, S. The first is a propositional language, PL(S); the second is a higher-order, typed language L(S). Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. The reason for introducing PL(S) is that, as shown in paper II of the series, it is the easiest way of understanding, and expanding on, the earlier work on topos theory and quantum physics. However, the main thrust of our programme utilises the more powerful language L(S) and its representation in an appropriate topos.",2007-03-07T16:00:51Z,2007-03-07T16:00:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703060v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0703060v1,"quant-ph, gr-qc, math-ph, math.MP"
Towards a Physical Theory of Subjective Mental States,Sean Lee,"Any complete theory of physical reality must allow for the ubiquitous phenomenon of subjective experience at some level, or risk being conceptually incoherent. However, as long as the ontological status of subjectivity itself remains unresolved, the topic will be seen as more within the purview of philosophy than of physics. Towards a resolution of this issue within empirically motivated physical theory, this article introduces an operational definition that ultilizes the general consensus that subjective mental states, whatever else is controversial about them, at least correlate in some way to physical states. It is shown here that implementing this underappreciated assumption within the framework of a physical theory in fact leads to wide-ranging consequences. In particular, a correlation requires there exist a well-defined mapping from a space of subjective mental states onto a space of information-bearing elements of some physical theory. Given the peculiar nature of subjective states as inherently private appearances, any empirical identification of states must be performed by the experiencing subject. It is argued that such an operationally defined 'self-measuring' act leads unavoidably to an 'uncertainty principle' that is analogous in some intriguing ways to Heisenberg's principle for quantum mechanics. A model is then introduced for subjective states as algorithmically incomputable numbers. Additionaally, an inequality similar to Bell's theorem may be derived, indicating an analogy with the violations of local reality and the ontology of observables within quantum mechanics.",2007-12-18T17:15:46Z,2007-12-18T17:15:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2873v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.2873v1,physics.gen-ph
Landau singularity and the instability of vacuum state in QED,Mofazzal Azam,"Quantum Eletrodynamics (QED) is considered as the most successful of all physical theories. It can predict numerical values of physical quantities to a spectacular degree of accuracy. However, from the very early days it has been known that, in QED, there are two important problems which are linked with the very foundation of the theory. In 1952, Dyson put forward strong argumnts to suggest that the perturbation seires in quantum electrodynamics can not be convergent. Just three years latter, in 1955, Landau argued that the effective running coupling constant in QED has a pole (Landau singularity) albeit at some very high energy scale. This paper addresses, in details, the question of stability of perturbative vacuum state of QED in the light of these two well known problems.   Landau has been a cult-like figure for many of us who studied theoretical physics in the former Soviet Union. As an undergraduate student in the department of theoretical physics of People's Friendship University, Moscow, in 1970's, I grew up hearing colourful stories about the legendary persona of Lev Davidovich from my teachers some of whom had known him at personal level.

"New physics, the cosmic ray spectrum knee, and $pp$ cross section   measurements","Aparna Dixit, Pankaj Jain, Douglas W. McKay, Parama Mukherjee","We explore the possibility that a new physics interaction can provide an explanation for the knee just above $10^6$ GeV in the cosmic ray spectrum. We model the new physics modifications to the total proton-proton cross section with an incoherent term that allows for missing energy above the scale of new physics. We add the constraint that the new physics must also be consistent with published $pp$ cross section measurements, using cosmic ray observations, an order of magnitude and more above the knee. We find that the rise in cross section required at energies above the knee is radical. The increase in cross section suggests that it may be more appropriate to treat the scattering process in the black disc limit at such high energies. In this case there may be no clean separation between the standard model and new physics contributions to the total cross section. We model the missing energy in this limit and find a good fit to the Tibet III cosmic ray flux data.

Unit Invariance as a Unifying Principle of Physics,Abrar Shaukat,"A basic principle of physics is the freedom to locally choose any unit system when describing physical quantities. Its implementation amounts to treating Weyl invariance as a fundamental symmetry of all physical theories. In this thesis, we study the consequences of this ""unit invariance"" principle and find that it is a unifying one. Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge field called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to point. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and matter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations. As a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to changes of scale. This response is calibrated by certain ""tractor Weyl weights"". Reality of these weights yield Breitenlohner-Freedman stability bounds in anti de Sitter spaces. Another valuable outcome of our approach is a general mechanism for constructing conformally invariant theories. In particular, we provide direct derivations of the novel Weyl invariant Deser--Nepomechie vector and spin three-half theories as well as new higher spin generalizations thereof. To construct these theories, a ""tractor calculus"" coming from conformal geometry is employed, which keeps manifest Weyl invariance at all stages. In fact, our approach replaces the usual Riemannian geometry description of physics with a conformal geometry one. Within the same framework, we also give a description of fermionic and interacting supersymmetric theories which again unifies massless and massive excitations.",2010-03-02T09:28:50Z,2010-03-02T09:28:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0534v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0534v1,"math-ph, gr-qc, hep-th, math.MP"
Gaseous Detectors: recent developments and applications,Maxim Titov,"Since long time, the compelling scientific goals of future high energy physics experiments were a driving factor in the development of advanced detector technologies. A true innovation in detector instrumentation concepts came in 1968, with the development of a fully parallel readout for a large array of sensing elements - the Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC), which earned Georges Charpak a Nobel prize in physics in 1992. Since that time radiation detection and imaging with fast gaseous detectors, capable of economically covering large detection volume with low mass budget, have been playing an important role in many fields of physics. Advances in photo-lithography and micro-processing techniques in the chip industry during the past decade triggered a major transition in the field of gas detectors from wire structures to Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) concepts, revolutionizing cell size limitations for many gas detector applications. The high radiation resistance and excellent spatial and time resolution make them an invaluable tool to confront future detector challenges at the next generation of colliders. The design of the new micro-pattern devices appears suitable for industrial production. Novel structures where MPGDs are directly coupled to the CMOS pixel readout represent an exciting field allowing timing and charge measurements as well as precise spatial information in 3D.

The article begins with an account of the geometric phase for cyclic adiabatic evolutions. An elementary derivation is given along with a worked example for two-state systems. The implications of time-reversal are explained, as is the fundamental connection between the geometric phase and energy level degeneracies. We also discuss methods of experimental observation. A brief account is given of geometric magnetism; this is a Lorenz-like force of geometric origin which appears in the dynamics of slow systems coupled to fast ones.   A number of theoretical developments of the geometric phase are presented. These include an informal discussion of fibre bundles, and generalizations of the geometric phase to degenerate eigenstates (the nonabelian case) and to nonadiabatic evolution. There follows an account of applications. Manifestations in classical physics include the Hannay angle and kinematic geometric phases. Applications in optics concern polarization dynamics, including the theory and observation of Pancharatnam's phase. Applications in molecular physics include the molecular Aharonov-Bohm effect and nuclear magnetic resonance studies.

Atoms in Flight and the Remarkable Connections between Atomic and   Hadronic Physics,Stanley J. Brodsky,"Atomic physics and hadron physics are both based on Yang Mills gauge theory; in fact, quantum electrodynamics can be regarded as the zero-color limit of quantum chromodynamics. I review a number of areas where the techniques of atomic physics provide important insight into the theory of hadrons in QCD. For example, the Dirac-Coulomb equation, which predicts the spectroscopy and structure of hydrogenic atoms, has an analog in hadron physics in the form of light-front relativistic equations of motion which give a remarkable first approximation to the spectroscopy, dynamics, and structure of light hadrons. The renormalization scale for the running coupling, which is unambiguously set in QED, leads to a method for setting the renormalization scale in QCD. The production of atoms in flight provides a method for computing the formation of hadrons at the amplitude level. Conversely, many techniques which have been developed for hadron physics, such as scaling laws, evolution equations, and light-front quantization have equal utility for atomic physics, especially in the relativistic domain.

Conjoining Speeds up Information Diffusion in Overlaying Social-Physical   Networks,"Osman Yagan, Dajun Qian, Junshan Zhang, Douglas Cochran","We study the diffusion of information in an overlaying social-physical network. Specifically, we consider the following set-up: There is a physical information network where information spreads amongst people through conventional communication media (e.g., face-to-face communication, phone calls), and conjoint to this physical network, there are online social networks where information spreads via web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, YouTube, etc. We quantify the size and the critical threshold of information epidemics in this conjoint social-physical network by assuming that information diffuses according to the SIR epidemic model. One interesting finding is that even if there is no percolation in the individual networks, percolation (i.e., information epidemics) can take place in the conjoint social-physical network. We also show, both analytically and experimentally, that the fraction of individuals who receive an item of information (started from an arbitrary node) is significantly larger in the conjoint social-physical network case, as compared to the case where the networks are disjoint. These findings reveal that conjoining the physical network with online social networks can have a dramatic impact on the speed and scale of information diffusion.",2011-12-17T01:05:49Z,2012-08-03T17:10:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4002v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.4002v2,"cs.SI, physics.soc-ph"
Toward a Theory on the Stability of Protein Folding: Challenges for   Folding Models,"Walter Simmons, Joel L. Weiner","We adopt the point of view that analysis of the stability of the protein folding process is central to understanding the underlying physics of folding. Stability of the folding process means that many perturbations do not disrupt the progress from the random coil to the native state. In this paper we explore the stability of folding using established methods from physics and mathematics. Our result is a preliminary theory of the physics of folding. We suggest some tests of these ideas using folding simulations.   We begin by supposing that folding events are related in some way to mechanical waves on the molecule. We adopt an analytical approach to the physics which was pioneered by M.V. Berry, (in another context), based upon mathematics developed mainly by R. Thom and V.I. Arnold. We find that the stability of the folding process can be understood in terms of structures known as caustics, which occur in many kinds of wave phenomena.   The picture that emerges is that natural selection has given us a set of protein molecules which have mechanical waves that propagate according to several mathematically specific restrictions. Successful simulations of folding can be used to test and constrain these wave motions. With some additional assumptions the theory explains or is consistent with a number of experimental facts about folding. We emphasize that this wave-based approach is fundamentally different from energy-based approaches.",2011-12-28T22:15:52Z,2011-12-28T22:15:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6190v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.6190v1,"physics.bio-ph, math-ph, math.MP, physics.chem-ph"
Physical Logic,"Kate Clements, Fay Dowker, Petros Wallden","In R.D. Sorkin's framework for logic in physics a clear separation is made between the collection of unasserted propositions about the physical world and the affirmation or denial of these propositions by the physical world. The unasserted propositions form a Boolean algebra because they correspond to subsets of an underlying set of spacetime histories. Physical rules of inference, apply not to the propositions in themselves but to the affirmation and denial of these propositions by the actual world. This physical logic may or may not respect the propositions' underlying Boolean structure. We prove that this logic is Boolean if and only if the following three axioms hold: (i) The world is affirmed, (ii) Modus Ponens and (iii) If a proposition is denied then its negation, or complement, is affirmed. When a physical system is governed by a dynamical law in the form of a quantum measure with the rule that events of zero measure are denied, the axioms (i) - (iii) prove to be too rigid and need to be modified. One promising scheme for quantum mechanics as quantum measure theory corresponds to replacing axiom (iii) with axiom (iv) Nature is as fine grained as the dynamics allows.",2012-01-30T16:09:38Z,2017-02-10T16:58:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6266v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.6266v2,"quant-ph, math.LO, physics.hist-ph"
Physics and Detectors at CLIC: CLIC Conceptual Design Report,"Lucie Linssen, Akiya Miyamoto, Marcel Stanitzki, Harry Weerts","This report describes the physics potential and experiments at a future multi-TeV e+e- collider based on the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) technology. The physics scenarios considered include precision measurements of known quantities as well as the discovery potential of physics beyond the Standard Model. The report describes the detector performance required at CLIC, taking into account the interaction point environment and especially beaminduced backgrounds. Two detector concepts, designed around highly granular calorimeters and based on concepts studied for the International Linear Collider (ILC), are described and used to study the physics reach and potential of such a collider. Detector subsystems and the principal engineering challenges are illustrated. The overall performance of these CLIC detector concepts is demonstrated by studies of the performance of individual subdetector systems as well as complete simulation studies of six benchmark physics processes. These full detector simulation and reconstruction studies include beaminduced backgrounds and physics background processes. After optimisation of the detector concepts and adopting the reconstruction algorithms the results show very efficient background rejection and clearly demonstrate the physics potential at CLIC in terms of precision mass and cross section measurements. Finally, an overview of future plans of the CLIC detector and physics study is given and a list of key detector R&D topics needed for detectors at CLIC is presented.",2012-02-27T14:10:27Z,2012-02-27T14:10:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5940v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5940v1,physics.ins-det
"Fundamental Principles of Theoretical Physics and Concepts of   Quasiaverages, Quantum Protectorate and Emergence",A. L. Kuzemsky,"In the present paper we discuss the interrelation of the advanced interdisciplinary concepts of modern physics such as symmetry breaking, quantum protectorate, emergence and the Bogoliubov's concept of quasiaverages in the context of modern theoretical physics, and, in particular, quantum and statistical physics. The main aim of this analysis was to demonstrate the connection and interrelation of these conceptual advances of the many-particle physics and to try to show explicitly that those concepts, though different in details, have certain common features. Some problems in the field of statistical physics of complex materials and systems e.g. foundation of the microscopic theory of magnetism and superconductivity were pointed in relation to these ideas. The main suggestion is that the emphasis of symmetry breaking concept is on the symmetry itself, whereas the method of quasiaverages emphasizes the degeneracy of a system. The concept of quantum protectorate reveals essential difference in the behavior of the complex many-body systems at the low-energy and high-energy scales. Thus the notion of quantum protectorate might provide distinctive signatures and good criteria for a hierarchy of energy scales and the appropriate emergent behavior.",2012-07-25T07:25:01Z,2012-07-25T07:25:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6433v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6433v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.hist-ph"
Generalized top-spin analysis and new physics in $e^{+} e^{-}$   collisions with beam polarization,"B. Ananthanarayan, Jayita Lahiri, Monalisa Patra, Saurabh D. Rindani","A generalized top-spin analysis proposed some time ago in the context of Standard Model and subsequently studied in varying contexts is now applied primarily to the case of $e^+e^-\rightarrow t\bar{t}$ with transversely polarized beams. This extends our recent work with new physics couplings of scalar ($S$) and tensor ($T$) types. We carry out a comprehensive analysis assuming only the electron beam to be transversely polarized, which is sufficient to probe these interactions, and also eliminates any azimuthal angular dependence due to standard model or new physics of vector ($V$) and axial-vector ($A$) type interactions. We then consider new physics of general four-Fermi type of $V$ and $A$ type with both beams transversely polarized and discuss implications with longitudinal polarization as well. The generalized spin bases are all investigated in the presence of either longitudinal or transverse beam polarization to look for appreciable deviation from the SM prediction in case of the new physics. 90% confidence level limits are obtained on the interactions for the generalized spin bases with realistic integrated luminosity. In order to achieve this we present a general discussion based on helicity amplitudes and derive a general transformation matrix that enables us to treat the spin basis. We find that beamline basis combined with transverse polarization provides an excellent window of opportunity both for $S$, $T$ and $V$, $A$ new physics, followed by the off diagonal basis. The helicity basis is shown to be the best in case of longitudinal polarization to look for new physics effectsdue to $V$ and $A$.",2012-10-04T11:20:45Z,2012-10-04T11:20:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1385v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.1385v1,"hep-ph, hep-ex"
Has Science Established that the Cosmos is Physically Comprehensible?,Nicholas Maxwell,"Most scientists would hold that science has not established that the cosmos is physically comprehensible - i.e. such that there is some as-yet undiscovered true physical theory of everything that is unified. This is an empirically untestable thesis and thus lies beyond the scope of science. However, this argument presupposes a conception of science which holds that in science theories are accepted solely on the basis of evidence. But this conception of science is untenable. Any fundamental physical theory, in order to be accepted as a part of theoretical scientific knowledge, must be (1) sufficiently empirically successful, and (2) sufficiently unified. Given any accepted theory of physics, endlessly many empirically more successful disunified rivals can always be concocted - disunified because they assert that different dynamical laws govern the diverse phenomena to which the theory applies. These disunified rivals are not considered for a moment in physics, despite their greater empirical success. This persistent rejection of empirically more successful but disunified rival theories means, I argue, that a big, highly problematic, implicit assumption is made by science about the cosmos, to the effect, at least, that the cosmos is such that all seriously disunified theories are false. Once this point is recognized, it becomes clear, I argue, that we need a new conception of science which holds that science makes a hierarchy of assumptions about the cosmos, these assumptions becoming less and less substantial as one goes up the hierarchy. One of these assumptions is that the cosmos is physically comprehensible. Hence the conclusion: improve our ideas about the nature of science and it becomes apparent that science has established that the cosmos is physically comprehensible.",2012-10-05T13:14:28Z,2012-10-05T13:14:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1747v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.1747v1,physics.hist-ph
Throughput Optimizing Localized Link Scheduling for Multihop Wireless   Networks Under Physical Interference Model,"Yaqin Zhou, Xiangyang Li, Min Liu, Xufei Mao, Shaojie Tang, Zhongcheng Li","We study throughput-optimum localized link scheduling in wireless networks. The majority of results on link scheduling assume binary interference models that simplify interference constraints in actual wireless communication. While the physical interference model reflects the physical reality more precisely, the problem becomes notoriously harder under the physical interference model. There have been just a few existing results on link scheduling under the physical interference model, and even fewer on more practical distributed or localized scheduling. In this paper, we tackle the challenges of localized link scheduling posed by the complex physical interference constraints. By cooperating the partition and shifting strategies into the pick-and-compare scheme, we present a class of localized scheduling algorithms with provable throughput guarantee subject to physical interference constraints. The algorithm in the linear power setting is the first localized algorithm that achieves at least a constant fraction of the optimal capacity region subject to physical interference constraints. The algorithm in the uniform power setting is the first localized algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio to the optimal solution.

On non-equilibrium physics and string theory,"Nickolas Gray, Djordje Minic, Michel Pleimling","In this article we review the relation between string theory and non-equilibrium physics based on our previously published work. First we explain why a theory of quantum gravity and non-equilibrium statistical physics should be related in the first place. Then we present the necessary background from the recent research in non-equilibrium physics. The review discusses the relationship of string theory and aging phenomena, as well as the connection between AdS/CFT correspondence and the Jarzynski identity. We also discuss the emergent symmetries in fully developed turbulence and the corresponding non-equilibrium stationary states. Finally we outline a larger picture regarding the relationship between non-perturbative quantum gravity and non-equilibrium statistical physics. This relationship can be understood as a natural generalization of the well-known Wilsonian relation between local quantum field theory and equilibrium statistical physics of critical phenomena. According to this picture the AdS/CFT duality is just an example of a more general connection between non-perturbative quantum gravity and non-equilibrium physics. In the appendix of this review we discuss a new kind of complementarity between thermodynamics and statistical physics which should be important in the context of black hole complementarity.",2013-01-27T15:46:12Z,2013-01-27T15:46:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6368v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6368v1,"hep-th, cond-mat.stat-mech"
Higgs factories,V. I. Telnov,"Over the past two decades, the high energy physics community has been actively discussing and developing a number of post-LHC collider projects; however, none of them have been approved due to high costs and the uncertainty in post-LHC physics scenarios. There have been great expectations of rich new physics in the 0.1-1 TeV mass region: the Higgs boson (one or several), supersymmetry, or perhaps new particles from the dark-matter family. It has been the general consensus that the best machine for the detailed study of new physics to be discovered at the LHC would be an energy-frontier linear e+e- collider. Physicists held their breath waiting for the results from the LHC. In summer 2012, two LHC detectors, ATLAS and CMS, announced the discovery of a Higgs boson with the mass of 126 GeV and (still) nothing else. The absence of new physics in the region below 1 TeV has changed the post-LHC collider R&D priorities and triggered a zoo of project proposals for the precision study of the 126 GeV Higgs boson, possibly with further upgrades to higher energies. This paper gives an overview of these projects; it is based largely on the reports presented at the first workshop on Higgs factories held at FNAL a few days prior to the present workshop in Protvino.",2013-07-15T11:19:54Z,2013-07-15T11:19:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3893v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.3893v1,"physics.acc-ph, hep-ex, hep-ph"

It is natural to consider that the rare decays of D meson might be more sensitive to new physics, and the rare decay $D^0\to \mu^+\mu^-$ could be an ideal area to search for new physics because it is a flavor changing process. In this work we look for a trace of new physics BSM in the leptonic decays of $D^0$, concretely we discuss the contributions of unparticle or an extra gauge boson $Z'$ while imposing the constraints set by fitting the $D^0-\bar D^0$ mixing data. We find that the long-distance SM effects for $D^0\to l\bar l$ still exceed those contributions of the BSM under consideration, but for a double-flavor changing process such as $D^0\to \mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}$, the new physics contribution would be significant.",2013-12-30T08:43:29Z,2014-10-09T05:19:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7649v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.7649v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex"
Plasma Physics of Extreme Astrophysical Environments,"Dmitri A. Uzdensky, Shane Rightley","Certain classes of astrophysical objects, namely magnetars and central engines of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), are characterized by extreme physical conditions not encountered elsewhere in the Universe. In particular, they possess magnetic fields that exceed the critical quantum field of 44 teragauss. Figuring out how these complex ultra-magnetized systems work requires understanding various plasma processes, both small-scale kinetic and large-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). However, an ultra-strong magnetic field modifies the underlying physics to such an extent that many relevant plasma-physical problems call for building QED-based relativistic quantum plasma physics. In this review, after describing the extreme astrophysical systems of interest and identifying the key relevant plasma-physical problems, we survey the recent progress in the development of such a theory. We discuss how a super-critical field modifies the properties of vacuum and matter and outline the basic theoretical framework for describing both non-relativistic and relativistic quantum plasmas. We then turn to astrophysical applications of relativistic QED plasma physics relevant to magnetar magnetospheres and central engines of supernovae and long GRBs. Specifically, we discuss propagation of light through a magnetar magnetosphere; large-scale MHD processes driving magnetar activity and GRB jet launching and propagation; energy-transport processes governing the thermodynamics of extreme plasma environments; micro-scale kinetic plasma processes important in the interaction of intense magnetospheric electric currents with a magnetar's surface; and magnetic reconnection of ultra-strong magnetic fields.

The quantum vacuum,G. S. Paraoanu,"The vacuum is the lowest energy state of a field in a certain region of space. This definition implies that no particles can be present in the vacuum state. In classical physics, the only features of vacuum are those of its geometry. For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a dynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent and curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is a structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are strictly associated with physical objects such as particles and finite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As I will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum physics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example that physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only when the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach properties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing real objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain perturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy shifts and creation of particles. An open question is if by necessity the vacuum comes with an embedded geometry, and if it is possible to construct viable physical theories in which geometry is detached from the vacuum.",2014-02-05T16:55:58Z,2014-12-12T13:32:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1087v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1087v2,"quant-ph, gr-qc"
Short Baseline Reactor Antineutrino-Electron Scattering Experiments and   Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions at Source and Detector,"Amir N. Khan, Douglas W. McKay, F. Tahir","We investigate non-standard interaction effects in antineutrino-electron scattering experiments with baselines short enough to ignore standard oscillation phenomena. The setup is free of ambiguities from the interference between new physics and oscillation effects and is sensitive to both semileptonic new physics at the source and purely leptonic new physics in the weak interaction scattering at the detector. We draw on the TEXONO experiment as the model system, extending its analysis of non-standard interaction effects at the detector to include the generally allowed non-standard interaction phase at the detector and both non-universal and flavor changing new physics at the reactor source. We confirm that the current data allows for new physics constraints at the detector of the same order as those currently published, but we find that constraints on the source new physics are at least an order of magnitude weaker. The new physics phase effects are at the 5% level, noticeable in the 90% C.L. contour plots but not significantly affecting the conclusions. Based on projected increase in sensitivity with an upgraded TEXONO experiment, we estimate the improvement of sensitivity to both source and detector non-standard interactions. We find that the bounds on source parameters improve by an order of magnitude, but do not reach parameter space beyond current limits. On the other hand, the detector new physics sensitivity would push current limits by factors 5 to 10 smaller.",2014-07-16T11:40:39Z,2014-07-16T11:40:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4263v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4263v1,hep-ph

As a supplement and/or alternative to this conventional approach, techniques rooted in the electromagnetic angular momentum physical layer have been advocated, and promising results from proof-of-concept radio communication experiments using angular momentum were recently published. This sparingly exploited physical observable describes the rotational (spinning and orbiting) physical properties of the electromagnetic fields and the rotational dynamics of the pertinent charge and current densities. In order to facilitate the exploitation of angular momentum techniques in real-world implementations, we present a systematic, comprehensive theoretical review of the fundamental physical properties of electromagnetic angular momentum observable. Starting from an overview that puts it into its physical context among the other Poincar\'e invariants of the electromagnetic field, we describe the multi-mode quantized character and other physical properties that sets electromagnetic angular momentum apart from the electromagnetic linear momentum. These properties allow, among other things, a more flexible and efficient utilization of the radio frequency spectrum. Implementation aspects are discussed and illustrated by examples based on analytic and numerical solutions.",2014-10-16T01:27:18Z,2015-05-29T12:12:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4268v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4268v3,"physics.optics, physics.class-ph"
Physics of Spectral Singularities,Ali Mostafazadeh,"Spectral singularities are certain points of the continuous spectrum of generic complex scattering potentials. We review the recent developments leading to the discovery of their physical meaning, consequences, and generalizations. In particular, we give a simple definition of spectral singularities, provide a general introduction to spectral consequences of ${\cal PT}$-symmetry (clarifying some of the controversies surrounding this subject), outline the main ideas and constructions used in the pseudo-Hermitian representation of quantum mechanics, and discuss how spectral singularities entered in the physics literature as obstructions to these constructions. We then review the transfer matrix formulation of scattering theory and the application of complex scattering potentials in optics. These allow us to elucidate the physical content of spectral singularities and describe their optical realizations. Finally, we survey some of the most important results obtained in the subject, drawing special attention to the remarkable fact that the condition of the existence of linear and nonlinear optical spectral singularities yield simple mathematical derivations of some of the basic results of laser physics, namely the laser threshold condition and the linear dependence of the laser output intensity on the gain coefficient.",2014-12-01T12:43:28Z,2015-04-05T11:01:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0454v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0454v3,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP, physics.optics"
The Common Elements of Atomic and Hadronic Physics,Stanley J. Brodsky,"Atomic physics and hadronic physics are both governed by the Yang Mills gauge theory Lagrangian; in fact, Abelian quantum electrodynamics can be regarded as the zero-color limit of quantum chromodynamics. I review a number of areas where the techniques of atomic physics can provide important insight into hadronic eigenstates in QCD. For example, the Dirac-Coulomb equation, which predicts the spectroscopy and structure of hydrogenic atoms, has an analog in hadron physics in the form of frame-independent light-front relativistic equations of motion consistent with light-front holography which give a remarkable first approximation to the spectroscopy, dynamics, and structure of light hadrons. The production of antihydrogen in flight can provide important insight into the dynamics of hadron production in QCD at the amplitude level. The renormalization scale for the running coupling is unambiguously set in QED; an analogous procedure sets the renormalization scales in QCD, leading to scheme-independent scale-fixed predictions.

Mathematical modeling of physical capital using the spatial Solow model,"Gilberto González-Parra, Benito Chen-Charpentier, Abraham J. Arenas, Miguel Diaz-Rodriguez","This research deals with the mathematical modeling of the physical capital diffusion through the borders of the countries. The physical capital is considered an important variable for the economic growth of a country. Here we use an extension of the economic Solow model to describe how the smuggling affects the economic growth of the countries. In this study we rely on a production function that is non-concave instead of the classical Cobb-Douglas production function. In order to model the physical capital diffusion through the borders of the country, we developed a model based on a parabolic partial differential equation that describes the dynamics of physical capital and boundary conditions of Neumann type. Smuggling is present in many borders between countries and may include fuel, machinery and food. This smuggling through the borders is a problematic issue for the country's economies. The smuggling problem usually is related mainly to a non-official exchange rate that is different than the official rate or subsides. Numerical simulations are obtained using an explicit finite difference scheme that shows how the physical capital diffusion through the border of the countries. The study of physical capital is a paramount issue for the economic growth of many countries for the next years. The results show that the dynamics of the physical capital when boundary conditions of Neumann type are different than zero differ from the classical economic behavior observed in the classical spatial Solow model without physical capital flux through the borders of countries. Finally, it can be concluded that avoiding the smuggling through the frontiers is an important factor that affects the economic growth of the countries.",2015-04-16T20:44:24Z,2015-04-16T20:44:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04388v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04388v1,"q-fin.GN, math.DS, 35A99, 35Q91, 37N40, G.1.8; J.4; I.6.0"

In particle physics, spin topics are on muon $g-2$, muon and neutron electric dipole moments, and time-reversal violation experiment in a kaon decay. Here, we focus more on hadron-spin physics as for future projects. For example, generalized parton distributions (GPDs) could be investigated by using pion and proton beams, whereas they are studied by the virtual Compton scattering at lepton facilities. The GPDs are key quantities for determining the three-dimensional picture of hadrons and for finding the origin of the nucleon spin including partonic orbital-angular-momentum contributions.

Space and time dependent scaling of numbers in mathematical structures:   Effects on physical and geometric quantities,Paul Benioff,"The relationship between the foundations of mathematics and physics is a topic of of much interest. This paper continues this exploration by examination of the effect of space and time dependent number scaling on theoretical descriptions of some physical and geometric quantities. Fiber bundles provide a good framework to introduce a space and time or space time dependent number scaling field. The effect of the scaling field on a few nonlocal physical and geometric quantities is described. The effect on gauge theories is to introduce a new complex scalar field into the derivatives appearing in Lagrangians. U(1) invariance of Lagrangian terms does not affect the real part of the scaling field. For this field, any mass is possible. The scaling field is also shown to affect quantum wave packets and path lengths, and geodesic equations even on flat space. Scalar fields described so far in physics, are possible candidates for the scaling field. The lack of direct evidence for the field in physics restricts the scaling field in that the gradient of the field must be close to zero in a local region of cosmological space and time. There are no restrictions outside the region. It is also seen that the scaling field does not affect comparisons of computation or measurements outputs with one another. However it does affect the assignment of numerical values to the outputs of computations or measurements. These are needed because theory predictions are in terms of numerical values.",2015-08-07T15:47:52Z,2015-08-07T15:47:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01732v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.01732v1,"math-ph, gr-qc, math.MP, quant-ph"
Effective Theory of Higgs Sector Vacuum States,"Daniel Egana-Ugrinovic, Scott Thomas","The effective field theory description for modifications of Standard Model-like Higgs boson interactions arising from tree-level mixing with heavy Higgs sector vacuum states without conserved quantum numbers is presented. An expansion in terms of effective operator dimension based on powers of the heavy mass scale rather than operator dimension is utilized to systematically organize interactions within the effective theory. Vacuum states arising from electroweak singlet extensions of the Higgs sector yield at leading order only two effective dimension-six operators. One of these uniformly dilutes all the interactions of a single physical Higgs boson as compared with Standard Model expectations, while the combination of the two operators give more general modifications of all remaining interactions with two or more physical Higgs bosons. Vacuum states arising from an additional electroweak doublet yield three types of effective dimension-six operators that modify physical Higgs boson couplings to fermion pairs, self-couplings, and introduce four-fermion interactions. However, in this case modification of physical Higgs boson interactions with massive gauge bosons arise at leading order only from three effective dimension-eight operators. If the underlying Yukawa couplings of the additional electroweak doublet satisfy the Glashow-Weinberg condition then time reversal violation at effective dimension-six depends on a single universal phase appearing only in couplings of physical Higgs bosons to fermion pairs. In all cases the couplings of any three physical states in the effective theory description must be equal to those in a unitary mixing description in order for the long distance non-analytic components of physical on-shell scattering amplitudes to agree, while in contrast couplings of four or more physical states in general differ due to short distance effects.",2015-12-01T05:28:29Z,2015-12-01T05:28:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00144v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00144v1,hep-ph
A new algebraic structure in the standard model of particle physics,"Latham Boyle, Shane Farnsworth","We introduce a new formulation of the real-spectral-triple formalism in non-commutative geometry (NCG): we explain its mathematical advantages and its success in capturing the structure of the standard model of particle physics. The idea, in brief, is to represent $A$ (the algebra of differential forms on some possibly-noncommutative space) on $H$ (the Hilbert space of spinors on that space), and to reinterpret this representation as a simple super-algebra $B=A\oplus H$ with even part $A$ and odd part $H$. $B$ is the fundamental object in our approach: we show that (nearly) all of the basic axioms and assumptions of the traditional real-spectral-triple formalism of NCG are elegantly recovered from the simple requirement that $B$ should be a differential graded $\ast$-algebra (or ""$\ast$-DGA""). Moreover, this requirement also yields other, new, geometrical constraints. When we apply our formalism to the NCG traditionally used to describe the standard model of particle physics, we find that these new constraints are physically meaningful and phenomenologically correct. In particular, these new constraints provide a novel interpretation of electroweak symmetry breaking that is geometric rather than dynamical. This formalism is more restrictive than effective field theory, and so explains more about the observed structure of the standard model, and offers more guidance about physics beyond the standard model.",2016-04-04T13:21:26Z,2018-06-15T17:58:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00847v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00847v2,"hep-th, hep-ph, math-ph, math.MP"
Particle Dark Matter Constraints: the Effect of Galactic Uncertainties,"Maria Benito, Nicolas Bernal, Nassim Bozorgnia, Francesca Calore, Fabio Iocco","Collider, space, and Earth based experiments are now able to probe several extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics which provide viable dark matter candidates. Direct and indirect dark matter searches rely on inputs of astrophysical nature, such as the local dark matter density or the shape of the dark matter profile in the target in object. The determination of these quantities is highly affected by astrophysical uncertainties. The latter, especially those for our own Galaxy, are ill-known, and often not fully accounted for when analyzing the phenomenology of particle physics models. In this paper we present a systematic, quantitative estimate of how astrophysical uncertainties on Galactic quantities (such as the local galactocentric distance, circular velocity, or the morphology of the stellar disk and bulge) propagate to the determination of the phenomenology of particle physics models, thus eventually affecting the determination of new physics parameters. We present results in the context of two specific extensions of the Standard Model (the Singlet Scalar and the Inert Doublet) that we adopt as case studies for their simplicity in illustrating the magnitude and impact of such uncertainties on the parameter space of the particle physics model itself. Our findings point toward very relevant effects of current Galactic uncertainties on the determination of particle physics parameters, and urge a systematic estimate of such uncertainties in more complex scenarios, in order to achieve constraints on the determination of new physics that realistically include all known uncertainties.",2016-12-06T21:00:07Z,2018-05-02T21:04:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02010v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02010v2,"hep-ph, astro-ph.GA"
Impact of New Physics on the EW vacuum stability in a curved spacetime   background,"E. Bentivegna, V. Branchina, F. Contino, D. Zappalà","It has been recently shown that, contrary to an intuitive decoupling argument, the presence of new physics at very large energy scales (say around the Planck scale) can have a strong impact on the electroweak vacuum lifetime. In particular, the vacuum could be totally destabilized. This study was performed in a flat spacetime background, and it is important to extend the analysis to curved spacetime since these are Planckian-physics effects. It is generally expected that under these extreme conditions gravity should totally quench the formation of true vacuum bubbles, thus washing out the destabilizing effect of new physics. In this work we extend the analysis to curved spacetime and show that, although gravity pushes toward stabilization, the destabilizing effect of new physics is still (by far) the dominating one. In order to get model independent results, high energy new physics is parametrized in two different independent ways: as higher order operators in the Higgs field, or introducing new particles with very large masses. The destabilizing effect is observed in both cases, hinting at a general mechanism that does not depend on the parametrization details for new physics, thus maintaining the results obtained from the analysis performed in flat spacetime.",2017-08-03T13:51:00Z,2017-08-03T13:51:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01138v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01138v1,"hep-ph, gr-qc, hep-th"
"The status of varying constants: a review of the physics, searches and   implications",C. J. A. P. Martins,"The observational evidence for the recent acceleration of the universe demonstrates that canonical theories of cosmology and particle physics are incomplete---if not incorrect---and that new physics is out there, waiting to be discovered. A key task for the next generation of laboratory and astrophysical facilities is to search for, identify and ultimately characterize this new physics. Here we highlight recent developments in tests of the stability of nature's fundamental couplings, which provide a direct handle on new physics: a detection of variations will be revolutionary, but even improved null results provide competitive constraints on a range of cosmological and particle physics paradigms. A joint analysis of all currently available data shows a preference for variations of $\alpha$ and $\mu$ at about the two-sigma level, but inconsistencies between different sub-sets (likely due to hidden systematics) suggest that these statistical preferences need to be taken with caution. On the other hand, these measurements strongly constrain Weak Equivalence Principle violations. Plans and forecasts for forthcoming studies with facilities such as ALMA, ESPRESSO and the ELT, which should clarify these issues, are also discussed, and synergies with other probes are briefly highlighted.

Hilbert's Sixth Problem: the endless road to rigour,Alexander N. Gorban,"Introduction to the special issue of Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 376, 2018, `Hilbert's Sixth Problem'. The essence of the Sixth Problem is discussed and the content of this issue is introduced.   In 1900, David Hilbert presented 23 problems for the advancement of mathematical science. Hilbert's Sixth Problem proposed the expansion of the axiomatic method outside of mathematics, in physics and beyond. Its title was shocking: ""Mathematical Treatment of the Axioms of Physics."" Axioms of physics did not exist and were not expected. During further explanation, Hilbert specified this problem with special focus on probability and ""the limiting processes, ... which lead from the atomistic view to the laws of motion of continua"". The programmatic call was formulated ""to treat, by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which already today mathematics plays an important part."" This issue presents a modern slice of the work on the Sixth Problem, from quantum probability to fluid dynamics and machine learning, and from review of solid mathematical and physical results to opinion pieces with new ambitious ideas. Some expectations were broken: The continuum limit of atomistic kinetics may differ from the classical fluid dynamics. The ""curse of dimensionality"" in machine learning turns into the ""blessing of dimensionality"" that is closely related to statistical physics. Quantum probability facilitates the modelling of geological uncertainty and hydrocarbon reservoirs. And many other findings are presented.",2018-03-09T17:06:23Z,2018-03-09T17:06:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03599v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03599v1,"physics.hist-ph, math-ph, math.HO, math.MP"
Classical physics and human embodiment: The role of contemplative   practice in integrating formal theory and personal experience in the   undergraduate physics curriculum,"Zosia Krusberg, Meredith Ward","One of the objectives of the undergraduate physics curriculum is for students to become aware of the connections between the fundamental principles of classical physics and their personal experience. Nonetheless, numerous studies have shown that students' awareness of such connections tends to deteriorate, sometimes substantially, following instruction. In this work, which constitutes the first analysis of the effects of contemplative practices on the learning experience in undergraduate physics courses, we present two practices aimed at integrating formal theory with students' personal, embodied experience: a sensory meditation and a contemplative videography. In written reflections on their experiences with the practices, the students expressed suddenly becoming aware of countless manifestations of formal physics principles in their surroundings, in an important step toward establishing firm connections between the abstract and the experiential. Furthermore, the students reported experiencing a sense of physical embodiment, heightened sensory awareness, somatic relaxation, and mental stillness, in significant contrast to their typical experience. Students also described experiencing insight about the essential role of observation in the scientific endeavor, a reawakened sense of curiosity, an intrinsic motivation to understand the observed physical phenomena, and a deepened awareness of their cognitive and emotional processes.",2018-04-16T15:42:41Z,2018-10-17T17:57:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05748v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05748v2,physics.ed-ph
Two patterns of PT-symmetry breakdown in a non-numerical six-state   simulation,"Miloslav Znojil, Denis I. Borisov","Three-parametric family of non-Hermitian but ${\cal PT}-$symmetric six-by-six matrix Hamiltonians $H^{(6)}(x,y,z)$ is considered. The ${\cal PT}-$symmetry remains spontaneously unbroken (i.e., the spectrum of the bound-state energies remains real so that the unitary-evolution stability of the quantum system in question is shown guaranteed) in a non-empty domain ${\cal D}^{(physical)}$ of parameters $x,y,z$. The construction of the exceptional-point (EP) boundary $\partial{\cal D}^{(physical)}$ of the physical domain is preformed using an innovative non-numerical implicit-function-construction strategy. The topology of the resulting EP boundary of the spontaneous ${\cal PT}-$symmetry breakdown (i.e., of the physical ""horizon of stability"") is shown similar to its much more elementary $N=4$ predecessor. Again, it is shown to consist of two components, viz., of the region of the quantum phase transitions of the first kind (during which at least some of the energies become complex) and of the quantum phase transitions of the second kind (during which some of the level pairs only cross but remain real).",2018-04-19T18:25:09Z,2018-04-19T18:25:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07324v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07324v1,"quant-ph, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"
CEPC Conceptual Design Report: Volume 2 - Physics & Detector,The CEPC Study Group,"The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a large international scientific facility proposed by the Chinese particle physics community to explore the Higgs boson and provide critical tests of the underlying fundamental physics principles of the Standard Model that might reveal new physics. The CEPC, to be hosted in China in a circular underground tunnel of approximately 100 km in circumference, is designed to operate as a Higgs factory producing electron-positron collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV. The collider will also operate at around 91.2 GeV, as a Z factory, and at the WW production threshold (around 160 GeV). The CEPC will produce close to one trillion Z bosons, 100 million W bosons and over one million Higgs bosons. The vast amount of bottom quarks, charm quarks and tau-leptons produced in the decays of the Z bosons also makes the CEPC an effective B-factory and tau-charm factory. The CEPC will have two interaction points where two large detectors will be located. This document is the second volume of the CEPC Conceptual Design Report (CDR). It presents the physics case for the CEPC, describes conceptual designs of possible detectors and their technological options, highlights the expected detector and physics performance, and discusses future plans for detector R&D and physics investigations. The final CEPC detectors will be proposed and built by international collaborations but they are likely to be composed of the detector technologies included in the conceptual designs described in this document.

Searches for physics beyond the standard model at the LHC,Jory Sonneveld,"At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), protons and heavy ions are accelerated to velocities close to the speed of light and collided in order to study particle interactions and give us an insight to the fundamental laws of nature. The energy and intensity of the particle beams at the LHC are unprecedented, and a tremendous amount of data is collected by three experiments on the circular ring of the LHC that are specialized in proton-proton collisions. The data confirm the most successful theory of particle physics to date known as the standard model of particle physics to very good precision, including the long expected and recently discovered Higgs boson. The standard model cannot, however, accommodate experimentally observed phenomena like gravity, neutrino masses, and dark matter. The theory can also be theoretically unsatisfying as a result of parameters that go unexplained, such as the relatively low value of the Higgs mass despite its large quantum corrections, implying a lack of understanding. For this reason, in addition to precision measurements of standard model observables, experiments search for new physics beyond the standard model that could explain some of the shortcomings of the standard model. A selection of results for searches for new physics beyond the standard model using data recorded by three experiments on the LHC are presented in this talk.",2019-05-15T15:19:42Z,2019-05-15T15:19:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06239v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06239v1,"hep-ex, hep-ph"
Physics-as-Inverse-Graphics: Unsupervised Physical Parameter Estimation   from Video,"Miguel Jaques, Michael Burke, Timothy Hospedales","We propose a model that is able to perform unsupervised physical parameter estimation of systems from video, where the differential equations governing the scene dynamics are known, but labeled states or objects are not available. Existing physical scene understanding methods require either object state supervision, or do not integrate with differentiable physics to learn interpretable system parameters and states. We address this problem through a physics-as-inverse-graphics approach that brings together vision-as-inverse-graphics and differentiable physics engines, enabling objects and explicit state and velocity representations to be discovered. This framework allows us to perform long term extrapolative video prediction, as well as vision-based model-predictive control. Our approach significantly outperforms related unsupervised methods in long-term future frame prediction of systems with interacting objects (such as ball-spring or 3-body gravitational systems), due to its ability to build dynamics into the model as an inductive bias. We further show the value of this tight vision-physics integration by demonstrating data-efficient learning of vision-actuated model-based control for a pendulum system. We also show that the controller's interpretability provides unique capabilities in goal-driven control and physical reasoning for zero-data adaptation.",2019-05-27T12:37:14Z,2020-04-21T12:14:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11169v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11169v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG"

Having a framework that could deal with these basic aspects of the simulation in a common way could provide great value to computational scientists by solving various numerical and class design issues that routinely arise. This paper describes the newly developed computational framework that we have built for rapidly prototyping new physics codes.

Cloth in the Wind: A Case Study of Physical Measurement through   Simulation,"Tom F. H. Runia, Kirill Gavrilyuk, Cees G. M. Snoek, Arnold W. M. Smeulders","For many of the physical phenomena around us, we have developed sophisticated models explaining their behavior. Nevertheless, measuring physical properties from visual observations is challenging due to the high number of causally underlying physical parameters -- including material properties and external forces. In this paper, we propose to measure latent physical properties for cloth in the wind without ever having seen a real example before. Our solution is an iterative refinement procedure with simulation at its core. The algorithm gradually updates the physical model parameters by running a simulation of the observed phenomenon and comparing the current simulation to a real-world observation. The correspondence is measured using an embedding function that maps physically similar examples to nearby points. We consider a case study of cloth in the wind, with curling flags as our leading example -- a seemingly simple phenomena but physically highly involved. Based on the physics of cloth and its visual manifestation, we propose an instantiation of the embedding function. For this mapping, modeled as a deep network, we introduce a spectral layer that decomposes a video volume into its temporal spectral power and corresponding frequencies. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably to prior work on the task of measuring cloth material properties and external wind force from a real-world video.",2020-03-09T21:32:23Z,2020-03-09T21:32:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05065v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05065v1,cs.CV

PLB contains information about the subject area of an article: Astrophysics and Cosmology, Experiments, Phenomenology or Theory. Those subject areas have been used since 2004. To extend those areas to earlier dates and try to separate HEP and NP publications, the idea was to use the information on the arXiv to accomplish this, by correlating a publication in PLB with a publication in one of the different arXiv repositories for particle, nuclear or astrophysics. The arXiv articles go back to at least 1995. When building the correlation between an arXiv article and each PLB article, it was found that many PLB articles do not have an existing reference in an arXiv article.

Learning to Identify Physical Parameters from Video Using Differentiable   Physics,"Rama Krishna Kandukuri, Jan Achterhold, Michael Möller, Jörg Stückler","Video representation learning has recently attracted attention in computer vision due to its applications for activity and scene forecasting or vision-based planning and control. Video prediction models often learn a latent representation of video which is encoded from input frames and decoded back into images. Even when conditioned on actions, purely deep learning based architectures typically lack a physically interpretable latent space. In this study, we use a differentiable physics engine within an action-conditional video representation network to learn a physical latent representation. We propose supervised and self-supervised learning methods to train our network and identify physical properties. The latter uses spatial transformers to decode physical states back into images. The simulation scenarios in our experiments comprise pushing, sliding and colliding objects, for which we also analyze the observability of the physical properties. In experiments we demonstrate that our network can learn to encode images and identify physical properties like mass and friction from videos and action sequences in the simulated scenarios. We evaluate the accuracy of our supervised and self-supervised methods and compare it with a system identification baseline which directly learns from state trajectories.

Early-Universe-Physics Insensitive and Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards:   Constraints on $Ω_{\rm{m}}$ and Implications for the Hubble Tension,"Weikang Lin, Xingang Chen, Katherine J. Mack","To further shed light on whether pre-recombination models can resolve the Hubble tension, we explore constraints on the cosmic background evolution that are insensitive to early-universe physics. The analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy has been thought to highly rely on early-universe physics. However, we show that the fact that the sound horizon at recombination being close to that at the end of the drag epoch is insensitive to early-universe physics. This allows us to link the absolute sizes of the two horizons and treat them as free parameters. Jointly, the CMB peak angular size, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae can be used as ""early-universe-physics insensitive and uncalibrated cosmic standards"", which measure the cosmic history from recombination to today. They can set strong and robust constraints on the post-recombination cosmic background, especially the matter density parameter with $\Omega_{\rm{m}}=0.302\pm0.008$ ($68\%$ C.L.) assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM after recombination. When we combine these with other non-local observations, we obtain several constraints on $H_0$ with significantly reduced sensitivity to early-universe physics. These are all more consistent with the Planck 2018 result than the local measurement results such as those based on Cepheids. This suggests a tension between the post-recombination, but non-local, observations and the local measurements which cannot be resolved by modifying pre-recombination early universe physics.",2021-02-10T19:14:15Z,2021-07-09T06:50:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05701v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05701v2,"astro-ph.CO, hep-ph, hep-th"
The Autodidactic Universe,"Stephon Alexander, William J. Cunningham, Jaron Lanier, Lee Smolin, Stefan Stanojevic, Michael W.

It does so by exploring a landscape of possible laws, which we express as a certain class of matrix models. We discover maps that put each of these matrix models in correspondence with both a gauge/gravity theory and a mathematical model of a learning machine, such as a deep recurrent, cyclic neural network. This establishes a correspondence between each solution of the physical theory and a run of a neural network. This correspondence is not an equivalence, partly because gauge theories emerge from $N \rightarrow \infty $ limits of the matrix models, whereas the same limits of the neural networks used here are not well-defined. We discuss in detail what it means to say that learning takes place in autodidactic systems, where there is no supervision. We propose that if the neural network model can be said to learn without supervision, the same can be said for the corresponding physical theory. We consider other protocols for autodidactic physical systems, such as optimization of graph variety, subset-replication using self-attention and look-ahead, geometrogenesis guided by reinforcement learning, structural learning using renormalization group techniques, and extensions. These protocols together provide a number of directions in which to explore the origin of physical laws based on putting machine learning architectures in correspondence with physical theories.",2021-03-29T02:25:02Z,2021-09-02T13:20:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03902v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03902v2,"hep-th, cs.AI, cs.LG, gr-qc, physics.hist-ph, quant-ph"

Only those who take a specialised physics course have the opportunity to learn modern physics. In 2011, the first study of a modern physics teaching intervention with an Australian upper primary (aged 10{11) class was conducted. The initial intervention was the first step of the Einstein-First collaboration towards challenging the current paradigm of Newtonian teaching in schools. It was found that modern physics concepts could be taught to these students. In 2020, 11 participants of the initial study (out of a total of 26) were contacted for a follow-up questionnaire and interview to investigate any long-term impact. The results of the follow-up indicate that the intervention maintained a positive impression on participants. The models and analogies used during the six-week intervention were highly memorable. The participants indicated that they found the intervention to be beneficial to their future learning. Even close to ten years after the intervention, the participants remembered several key concepts (such as curved space-time).

Enhancing predictive skills in physically-consistent way: Physics   Informed Machine Learning for Hydrological Processes,"Pravin Bhasme, Jenil Vagadiya, Udit Bhatia","Current modeling approaches for hydrological modeling often rely on either physics-based or data-science methods, including Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. While physics-based models tend to rigid structure resulting in unrealistic parameter values in certain instances, ML algorithms establish the input-output relationship while ignoring the constraints imposed by well-known physical processes. While there is a notion that the physics model enables better process understanding and ML algorithms exhibit better predictive skills, scientific knowledge that does not add to predictive ability may be deceptive. Hence, there is a need for a hybrid modeling approach to couple ML algorithms and physics-based models in a synergistic manner. Here we develop a Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) model that combines the process understanding of conceptual hydrological model with predictive abilities of state-of-the-art ML models. We apply the proposed model to predict the monthly time series of the target (streamflow) and intermediate variables (actual evapotranspiration) in the Narmada river basin in India. Our results show the capability of the PIML model to outperform a purely conceptual model ($abcd$ model) and ML algorithms while ensuring the physical consistency in outputs validated through water balance analysis. The systematic approach for combining conceptual model structure with ML algorithms could be used to improve the predictive accuracy of crucial hydrological processes important for flood risk assessment.",2021-04-22T12:13:42Z,2021-04-22T12:13:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11009v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11009v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.AP"

"Colloquium: Majorana Fermions in nuclear, particle and solid-state   physics","S. R. Elliott, M. Franz","Ettore Majorana (1906-1938) disappeared while traveling by ship from Palermo to Naples in 1938. His fate has never been fully resolved and several articles have been written that explore the mystery itself. His demise intrigues us still today because of his seminal work, published the previous year, that established symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic particle that is its own anti-particle. This work has long had a significant impact in neutrino physics, where this fundamental question regarding the particle remains unanswered. But the formalism he developed has found many uses as there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be truly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their anti-particles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of nuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double beta decay can only exist if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence, many efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana's influence doesn't stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original consideration. The equations he derived also arise in solid state physics where they describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of special interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one and two spatial dimensions at exactly zero energy. These Majorana zero modes are endowed with some remarkable physical properties that may lead to advances in quantum computing and, in fact, there is evidence that they have been experimentally observed. This review first summarizes the basics of Majorana's theory and its implications. It then provides an overview of the rich experimental programs trying to find a fermion that is its own anti-particle in nuclear, particle, and solid state physics.",2014-03-19T20:54:00Z,2014-12-01T21:36:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4976v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4976v2,"cond-mat.supr-con, cond-mat.mes-hall, hep-ex, nucl-ex"

How physics instruction impacts students' beliefs about learning   physics: A meta-analysis of 24 studies,"Adrian Madsen, Sarah B. McKagan, Eleanor C. Sayre","In this meta-analysis, we synthesize the results of 24 studies using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) and the Maryland Physics Expectations Survey (MPEX) to answer several questions: (1) How does physics instruction impact students' beliefs? (2) When do physics majors develop expert-like beliefs? and (3) How do students' beliefs impact their learning of physics? We report that in typical physics classes, students' beliefs deteriorate or at best stay the same. There are a few types of interventions, including an explicit focus on model-building and/or developing expert- like beliefs that lead to significant improvements in beliefs. Further, small courses and those for elementary education and non-science majors also result in improved beliefs. However, because the available data oversamples certain types of classes, it is unclear whether these improvements are actually due to the interventions, or due to the small class size, or student population typical of the kinds of classes in which these interventions are most often used. Physics majors tend to enter their undergraduate education with more expert-like beliefs than non-majors and these beliefs remain relatively stable throughout their undergraduate careers. Thus, typical physics courses appear to be selecting students who already have strong beliefs, rather than supporting students in developing strong beliefs. There is a small correlation between students' incoming beliefs about physics and their gains on conceptual mechanics surveys. This suggests that students with more expert-like incoming beliefs may learn more in their physics courses, but this finding should be further explored and replicated. Some unanswered questions remain. To answer these questions, we advocate several specific types of future studies.",2014-03-25T22:04:30Z,2015-05-28T19:08:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6522v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6522v3,physics.ed-ph

Probing New Physics Scales from Higgs and Electroweak Observables at   $e^+ e^-$ Higgs Factory,"Shao-Feng Ge, Hong-Jian He, Rui-Qing Xiao","New physics beyond the standard model (SM) can be model-independently formulated via dimension-6 effective operators, whose coefficients (cutoffs) characterize the scales of new physics. We study the probe of new physics scales from the electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs observables (HO) at the future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory (such as CEPC). To optimize constraints of new physics from all available observables, we establish a scheme-independent approach. With this formulation, we treat the SM electroweak parameters and the coefficients of dimension-6 operators on equal footing, which can be fitted simultaneously by the same $\chi^2$ function. As deviations from the SM are generally small, we can expand the new physics parameters up to linear order and perform an analytical $\chi^2$ fit to derive the potential reach of the new physics scales. We find that the HO from both Higgs produnction and decay rates can probe the new physics scales up to 10TeV (and to 44TeV for the case of gluon-involved operator $\mathcal{O}_g$), and the new physics scales of Yukawa-type operators can be probed by the precision Higgs coupling measurements up to (13-25)TeV. Further including the EWPO can push the limit up to 35TeV. From this prospect, we demonstrate that the EWPO measured in the early phase of a Higgs factory can be as important as the Higgs observables. These indirect probes of new physics scales at the Higgs factory can mainly cover the energy range to be directly explored by the next generation hadron colliders of pp(50-100TeV), such as the SPPC and FCC-hh.",2016-03-10T19:30:12Z,2016-09-18T12:57:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03385v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03385v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex"

A longitudinal analysis of students' motivational characteristics in   introductory physics courses: Gender differences,"Emily Marshman, Zeynep Y. Kalender, Christian Schunn, Timothy Nokes-Malach, Chandralekha Singh","The lack of diversity and the under-performance of underrepresented students in STEM courses have been the focus of researchers in the last decade. In particular, many hypotheses have been put forth for the reasons for the under-representation and under-performance of women in physics. Here, we present a framework for helping all students learn in science courses that takes into account four factors: 1) characteristics of instruction and learning tools, 2) implementation of instruction and learning tools, 3) student characteristics, and 4) students' environments. While there has been much research on factor 1 (characteristics of instruction and learning tools), there has been less focus on factor 2 (students' characteristics, and in particular, motivational factors). Here, we focus on the baseline motivational characteristics of introductory physics students obtained from survey data to inform factor 2 of the framework. A longitudinal analysis of students' motivational characteristics in two-semester introductory physics courses was performed by administering pre- and post-surveys that evaluated students' self-efficacy, grit, fascination with physics, value associated with physics, intelligence mindset, and physics epistemology. Female students reported lower self-efficacy, fascination and value, and had a more ""fixed"" view of intelligence in the context of physics compared to male students. Grit was the only factor on which female students reported averages that were equal to or higher than male students throughout introductory physics courses. These gender differences can at least partly be attributed to the societal stereotypes and biases about who belongs in physics and can excel in it. The findings inform the framework and have implications for the development and implementation of effective pedagogies and learning tools to help all students learn.",2021-02-15T03:16:59Z,2021-02-15T03:16:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07321v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07321v1,physics.ed-ph

Robust Backdoor Attacks against Deep Neural Networks in Real Physical   World,"Mingfu Xue, Can He, Shichang Sun, Jian Wang, Weiqiang Liu","Deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely deployed in various applications. However, many researches indicated that DNN is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The attacker can create a hidden backdoor in target DNN model, and trigger the malicious behaviors by submitting specific backdoor instance. However, almost all the existing backdoor works focused on the digital domain, while few studies investigate the backdoor attacks in real physical world. Restricted to a variety of physical constraints, the performance of backdoor attacks in the real physical world will be severely degraded. In this paper, we propose a robust physical backdoor attack method, PTB (physical transformations for backdoors), to implement the backdoor attacks against deep learning models in the real physical world. Specifically, in the training phase, we perform a series of physical transformations on these injected backdoor instances at each round of model training, so as to simulate various transformations that a backdoor may experience in real world, thus improves its physical robustness. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art face recognition model show that, compared with the backdoor methods that without PTB, the proposed attack method can significantly improve the performance of backdoor attacks in real physical world. Under various complex physical conditions, by injecting only a very small ratio (0.5%) of backdoor instances, the attack success rate of physical backdoor attacks with the PTB method on VGGFace is 82%, while the attack success rate of backdoor attacks without the proposed PTB method is lower than 11%. Meanwhile, the normal performance of the target DNN model has not been affected.",2021-04-15T11:51:14Z,2021-07-15T12:50:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07395v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07395v2,"cs.CR, cs.AI"

Geometric unification theory of the grand unification and gravitational   interactions and new physics,"C. Huang, Yong-Chang Huang","This paper discovers geometric unification theory of the grand unification and gravitational interactions and their new physics according to the general fiber bundle theory, symmetry and so on. Consequently, the research of this paper is based on the exact scientific bases of mathematics and physics. The Lagrangians of the grand unification and gravitational interactions are unifiedly deduced from quantitative causal principle (QCP) and satisfy the gauge invariant principle of general gauge fields interacting with Fermion and/or boson fields. The geometry and physics meanings of gauge invariant property of different physical systems are revealed, and it is discovered that all the Lagrangians of the four fundamental physics interactions are composed of the invariant quantities in corresponding spacetime structures. The difficulties that fundamental physics interactions and Noether theorem are not able to be unifiedly given and investigated are overcome, the geometric unification theory and origins of the four fundamental physics interactions and Noether theorem are shown by QCP, their two-order general Euler-Lagrange Equations and corresponding Noether conservation currents are derived in general curved spacetime. This paper further deduces QCP from symmetric principle. Consequently, geometric unification theory of the grand unification and gravitation theories and Noether theorem based on symmetric principle and the new physics are given in this paper. This paper further gives the unification of QCP and symmetric principle.

Fundamental Physics in Small Experiments,"T. Blum, P. Winter, T. Bhattacharya, T. Y. Chen, V. Cirigliano, D. DeMille, A. Gerarci, N. R. Hutzler, T. M. Ito, O. Kim, R. Lehnert, W. M. Morse, Y. K. Semertzidis","High energy physics aims to understand the fundamental laws of particles and their interactions at both the largest and smallest scales of the universe. This typically means probing very high energies or large distances or using high-intensity beams, which often requires large-scale experiments. A complementary approach is offered through high-precision measurements in small- and mid-scale size experiments, often at lower energies. The field of such high-precision experiments has seen tremendous progress and importance for particle physics for at least two reasons. First, they exploit synergies to adjacent areas of particle physics and benefit by many recent advances in experimental techniques. Together with intensified phenomenological explorations, these advances led to the realization that challenges associated with weak couplings or the expected suppression factors from the mass scale of new physics can be overcome with such methods. Second, many of these measurements add a new set of particle physics phenomena and observables that can be reached compared to the more conventional methodologies using high energies. Combining high-precision, smaller-scale measurements with the large-scale efforts therefore casts a wider and tighter net for possible effects originating from physics beyond the Standard Model.   This report presents a broad set of small-scale research projects that could provide key new precision measurements in the areas of electric dipole moments, magnetic dipole moments, fermion flavor violation, tests of spacetime symmetries, and tests with gravity. The growing impact of these high-precision studies in high energy physics and the complementary input they provide compared to large-scale efforts warrants strong support over the next decades. In particular, EDM searches are expected to improve sensitivities by four or more orders of magnitude in the next decade or two.",2022-09-16T16:38:49Z,2022-10-27T16:02:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08041v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08041v2,"hep-ex, hep-lat, hep-ph"

NovPhy: A Testbed for Physical Reasoning in Open-world Environments,"Chathura Gamage, Vimukthini Pinto, Cheng Xue, Peng Zhang, Ekaterina Nikonova, Matthew Stephenson, Jochen Renz","Due to the emergence of AI systems that interact with the physical environment, there is an increased interest in incorporating physical reasoning capabilities into those AI systems. But is it enough to only have physical reasoning capabilities to operate in a real physical environment? In the real world, we constantly face novel situations we have not encountered before. As humans, we are competent at successfully adapting to those situations. Similarly, an agent needs to have the ability to function under the impact of novelties in order to properly operate in an open-world physical environment. To facilitate the development of such AI systems, we propose a new testbed, NovPhy, that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios in the presence of novelties and take actions accordingly. The testbed consists of tasks that require agents to detect and adapt to novelties in physical scenarios. To create tasks in the testbed, we develop eight novelties representing a diverse novelty space and apply them to five commonly encountered scenarios in a physical environment. According to our testbed design, we evaluate two capabilities of an agent: the performance on a novelty when it is applied to different physical scenarios and the performance on a physical scenario when different novelties are applied to it. We conduct a thorough evaluation with human players, learning agents, and heuristic agents. Our evaluation shows that humans' performance is far beyond the agents' performance. Some agents, even with good normal task performance, perform significantly worse when there is a novelty, and the agents that can adapt to novelties typically adapt slower than humans. We promote the development of intelligent agents capable of performing at the human level or above when operating in open-world physical environments.

An Integrated Cyber-Physical Risk Assessment Framework for Worst-Case   Attacks in Industrial Control Systems,"Navid Aftabi, Dan Li, Ph. D., Thomas Sharkey, Ph. D","Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are widely used in critical infrastructures that face various cyberattacks causing physical damage. With the increasing integration of the ICSs and information technology (IT), ensuring the security of ICSs is of paramount importance. In an ICS, cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities to compromise sensors and controllers, aiming to cause physical damage. Maliciously accessing different components poses varying risks, highlighting the importance of identifying high-risk cyberattacks. This aids in designing effective detection schemes and mitigation strategies. This paper proposes an optimization-based cyber-risk assessment framework that integrates cyber and physical systems of ICSs. The framework models cyberattacks with varying expertise and knowledge by 1) maximizing physical impact in terms of failure time of the physical system, 2) quickly accessing the sensors and controllers in the cyber system while exploiting limited vulnerabilities, 3) avoiding detection in the physical system, and 4) complying with the cyber and physical restrictions. These objectives enable us to jointly model the interactions between the cyber and physical systems and study the critical cyberattacks that cause the highest impact on the physical system under certain resource constraints. Our framework serves as a tool to understand the vulnerabilities of an ICS with a holistic consideration of cyber and physical systems and their interactions and assess the risk of existing detection schemes by generating the worst-case attack strategies. We illustrate and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method in a numerical and a case study. The results show that a worst-case strategic attacker causes almost 19% further acceleration in the failure time of the physical system while remaining undetected compared to a random attacker.",2023-04-14T19:47:21Z,2024-01-30T19:47:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07363v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07363v5,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Synthesizing Physical Backdoor Datasets: An Automated Framework   Leveraging Deep Generative Models,"Sze Jue Yang, Chinh D. La, Quang H. Nguyen, Kok-Seng Wong, Anh Tuan Tran, Chee Seng Chan, Khoa D. Doan","Backdoor attacks, representing an emerging threat to the integrity of deep neural networks, have garnered significant attention due to their ability to compromise deep learning systems clandestinely. While numerous backdoor attacks occur within the digital realm, their practical implementation in real-world prediction systems remains limited and vulnerable to disturbances in the physical world. Consequently, this limitation has given rise to the development of physical backdoor attacks, where trigger objects manifest as physical entities within the real world. However, creating the requisite dataset to train or evaluate a physical backdoor model is a daunting task, limiting the backdoor researchers and practitioners from studying such physical attack scenarios. This paper unleashes a recipe that empowers backdoor researchers to effortlessly create a malicious, physical backdoor dataset based on advances in generative modeling. Particularly, this recipe involves 3 automatic modules: suggesting the suitable physical triggers, generating the poisoned candidate samples (either by synthesizing new samples or editing existing clean samples), and finally refining for the most plausible ones. As such, it effectively mitigates the perceived complexity associated with creating a physical backdoor dataset, transforming it from a daunting task into an attainable objective. Extensive experiment results show that datasets created by our ""recipe"" enable adversaries to achieve an impressive attack success rate on real physical world data and exhibit similar properties compared to previous physical backdoor attack studies. This paper offers researchers a valuable toolkit for studies of physical backdoors, all within the confines of their laboratories.",2023-12-06T11:05:11Z,2024-03-15T12:30:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03419v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03419v3,cs.CR

Improved Composite-Boson Theory of Monolayer and Bilayer Quantum Hall   Ferromagnets,Z. F. Ezawa,An improved composite-boson theory of quantum Hall ferromagnets is formulated both for the monolayer and bilayer systems. In this scheme the field operator describes solely the physical degrees of freedom representing the deviation from the ground state. Skyrmions are charged excitations confined to the lowest Landau level. By evaluating the excitation energy of one skyrmion in the interlayer-coherent phase it is shown that the bilayer QH state becomes stabler as the interlayer density difference becomes larger.,1998-10-01T09:43:53Z,1998-10-01T09:43:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9810003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9810003v1,cond-mat.mes-hall
Coupled exciton model with off-diagonal disorder for optical excitations   in extended dendrimers,Kikuo Harigaya,"A phenomenological coupled exciton model is proposed in order to characterize optical excitations in extended dendrimers.

The decreasing optical excitation energy with respect to the dendrimer size indicates the presence of exciton funnels along the backbone of the dendrimers. Therefore, the extended dendrimers can work as artificial fractal antenna systems which capture energy of light.",1998-10-06T12:36:12Z,1999-02-09T09:17:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9810049v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9810049v2,"cond-mat, physics.chem-ph, physics.optics, quant-ph"

Cosmic Censorship: the Role of Quantum Physics,Shahar Hod,"The cosmic censorship hypothesis introduced by Penrose thirty years ago is still one of the most important open questions in {\it classical} general relativity. The main goal of this paper is to put forward the idea that cosmic censorship is intrinsically a {\it quantum} phenomena. We construct a gedanken experiment which seems to violate the cosmic censorship principle within the purely {\it classical} framework of general relativity. We prove, however, that {\it quantum} physics restores the validity of the conjecture. It is therefore suggested that cosmic censorship might be enforced by a quantum theory of gravity.",1999-08-01T12:44:08Z,1999-08-01T12:44:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9908004v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9908004v1,"gr-qc, astro-ph, hep-th, quant-ph"

Time Variation of Fundamental Constants as a Probe of New Physics,Paul Langacker,Time variation of fundamental constants would not be surprising in the framework of theories involving extra dimensions.

Second, string theory offers some possible answers to a number of troubling naturalness questions.

A solution is suggested in form of a Local Equilibrium Condition, which can be applied to linear relativistic quantum field theories but not directly to selfinteracting quantum fields. The concept of local temperature resulting from LEC is compared to an old approach to local temperature based on the principle of maximal entropy.

Configuration of points and strings,Igor Reider,Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $n\geq 2$. It is shown that a finite configuration of points on $X$ subject to certain geometric conditions possesses rich inner structure. On the mathematical level this inner structure is a variation of Hodge-like structure. As a consequence one can attach to such point configurations: (i) Lie algebras and their representations (ii) Fano toric variety whose hyperplane sections are Calabi-Yau varieties. These features lead to a picture which is very suggestive of quantum gravity according to string theory.,2006-02-15T11:54:38Z,2011-03-28T11:03:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602329v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0602329v2,"math.AG, math-ph, math.MP, 14J, 14J60"

Then all fields are expanded in a Taylor series around the observer's present position, and terms of order higher than p are truncated.

We calculate the particular forms of objective time derivatives for scalars, vectors, covectors and different second order tensors from the point of view of a rotating observer. The relation of substantial, material and objective time derivatives is treated.",2006-08-31T08:49:22Z,2006-10-23T20:29:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0608065v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0608065v2,"math-ph, math.MP"
Integral formulas for electrically charged space regions - theory and   application,Miron J. Cristea,"Based on Gauss's law for the electric field, new integral formulas are deduced. Although the applications are not limited within the physics realm, an application is also presented, for the sake of practicability, specifically in the area of semiconductor junctions.",2006-08-31T14:02:50Z,2007-02-13T15:55:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0608068v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0608068v5,"math-ph, math.MP, physics.class-ph, 78A25"
Regularization for zeta functions with physical applications I,"Minoru Fujimoto, Kunihiko Uehara","We propose a regularization technique and apply it to the Euler product of zeta functions, mainly of the Riemann zeta function, to make unknown some clear. In this paper that is the first part of the trilogy, we try to demonstrate the Riemann hypotheses by this regularization technique and show conditions to realize them. In part two, we will focus on zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the nature of prime numbers in order to prepare ourselves for physical applications in the third part.",2006-09-06T10:54:02Z,2006-09-06T10:54:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0609013v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0609013v1,"math-ph, math.MP, 11M06, 11M26"
The Wigner-Yanase entropy is not subadditive,Frank Hansen,"Wigner and Yanase introduced in 1963 the Wigner-Yanase entropy defined as minus the skew information of a state with respect to a conserved observable. They proved that the Wigner-Yanase entropy is a concave function in the state and conjectured that it is subadditive with respect to the aggregation of possibly interacting subsystems. While this turned out to be true for the quantum-mechanical entropy, we negate the conjecture for the Wigner-Yanase entropy by providing a counter example.",2006-09-07T14:17:54Z,2006-11-22T12:45:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0609019v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0609019v2,"math-ph, math.MP"
Integrable Models From Twisted Half Loop Algebras,"Nicolas Crampe, Charles A. S. Young","This paper is devoted to the construction of new integrable quantum mechanical models based on certain subalgebras of the half loop algebra of gl(N). Various results about these subalgebras are proven by presenting them in the notation of the St Petersburg school. These results are then used to demonstrate the integrability, and find the symmetries, of two types of physical system: twisted Gaudin magnets, and Calogero-type models of particles on several half-lines meeting at a point.",2006-09-21T09:53:02Z,2007-05-15T15:16:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0609057v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0609057v2,"math-ph, hep-th, math.MP, nlin.SI, 70H06; 81R12"
Equivalence of resolvent and scattering resonances on quantum graphs,"Pavel Exner, Jiří Lipovský","We discuss resonances for Schr\""odinger operators on metric graphs which consists of a finite compact part and a finite number of halflines attached to it; the vertex coupling is assumed to be of the $\delta$-type or certain modifications of it. Using exterior complex scaling on the graph we show that the resolvent and scattering resonances coincide in this case.",2006-10-25T14:24:01Z,2006-10-25T14:24:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0610065v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0610065v1,"math-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, math.MP, math.SP, quant-ph, 81V99"
Formal matrix integrals and combinatorics of maps,Bertrand Eynard,"This article is a short review on the relationship between convergent matrix integrals, formal matrix integrals, and combinatorics of maps. We briefly summarize results developed over the last 30 years, as well as more recent discoveries. We recall that formal matrix integrals are identical to combinatorial generating functions for maps, and that formal matrix integrals are in general very different from convergent matrix integrals. Finally, we give a list of the classical matrix models which have played an important role in physics in the past decades. Some of them are now well understood, some are still difficult challenges.",2006-11-30T16:36:39Z,2006-12-19T09:33:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0611087v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0611087v3,"math-ph, hep-th, math.MP"
