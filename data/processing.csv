Process Comparison Using Object-Centric Process Cubes,"Anahita Farhang Ghahfarokhi, Alessandro Berti, Wil M. P. van der Aalst","Process mining provides ways to analyze business processes. Common process mining techniques consider the process as a whole. However, in real-life business processes, different behaviors exist that make the overall process too complex to interpret. Process comparison is a branch of process mining that isolates different behaviors of the process from each other by using process cubes. Process cubes organize event data using different dimensions. Each cell contains a set of events that can be used as an input to apply process mining techniques. Existing work on process cubes assume single case notions. However, in real processes, several case notions (e.g., order, item, package, etc.) are intertwined. Object-centric process mining is a new branch of process mining addressing multiple case notions in a process. To make a bridge between object-centric process mining and process comparison, we propose a process cube framework, which supports process cube operations such as slice and dice on object-centric event logs. To facilitate the comparison, the framework is integrated with several object-centric process discovery approaches.",2021-03-12T10:08:28Z,2021-03-12T10:08:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07184v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07184v1,"cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Integral Equations in the Theory of Levy Processes,Lev Sakhnovich,"In this article we consider the Levy processes and the corresponding semigroup. We represent the generator of this semigroup in a convolution form. Using the obtained convolution form and the theory of integral equations we investigate the properties of a wide class of Levy processes (potential, quasi-potential, the probability of the Levy process remaining within the given domain, long time behavior, stable processes). We analyze in detail a number of concrete examples of the Levy processes (stable processes, the variance damped Levy processes, the variance gamma processes, the normal Gaussian process, the Meixner process, the compound Poisson process).",2007-02-13T16:47:20Z,2007-02-13T16:47:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702378v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0702378v1,"math.PR, math.FA, 60G51, 60J45, 60G17, 45A05"
Bi-Entangled Hidden Markov Processes and Recurrence,Soueidi El Gheteb,"In this paper, we introduce the notion of Bi-entangled hidden Markov processes. These are hidden quantum processes where the hidden processes themselves exhibit entangled Markov process, and the observable processes also exhibit entanglement. We present a specific formula for the joint expectation of these processes. Furthermore, we discuss the recurrence of the underlying quantum Markov processes associated to the Bi-entangled hidden Markov processes and we establish that, by restricting them within suitable commutative subalgebras (diagonal subalgebras) leads to the recovery of Markov processes defined by the hidden stochastic matrix. In this paper we only deal with processes with an at most countable state space.",2024-07-12T16:05:55Z,2024-07-12T16:05:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09384v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09384v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"
Remarks on the Poisson additive process,Haoming Wang,"The Poisson additive process is a binary conditionally additive process such that the first is the Poisson process provided the second is given. We prove the existence and uniqueness of predictable increasing mean intensity for the Poisson additive process. Besides, we establish a likelihood ratio formula for the Poisson additive process. It directly implies there doesn't exist an anticipative Poisson additive process which is absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Poisson process, which confirms a conjecture proposed by P. Br\'emaud in his PhD thesis in 1972. When applied to the Hawkes process, it concludes that the self-exciting function is constant. Similar results are also obtained for the Wiener additive process and Markov additive process.",2024-07-31T14:53:22Z,2024-08-14T14:44:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21651v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21651v2,"math.PR, stat.AP, 60A05, 60G05, 60G55"
BPCE: A Prototype for Co-Evolution between Business Process Variants   through Configurable Process Model,"Linyue Liu, Xi Guo, Chun Ouyang, Patrick C. K. Hung, Hong-Yu Zhang, Keqing He, Chen Mo, Zaiwen Feng","With the continuous development of business process management technology, the increasing business process models are usually owned by large enterprises. In large enterprises, different stakeholders may modify the same business process model. In order to better manage the changeability of processes, they adopt configurable business process models to manage process variants. However, the process variants will vary with the change in enterprise business demands. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the co-evolution of the process variants so as to effectively manage the business process family. To this end, a novel framework for co-evolution between business process variants through a configurable process model is proposed in this work. First, the mapping relationship between process variants and configurable models is standardized in this study. A series of change operations and change propagation operations between process variants and configurable models are further defined for achieving propagation. Then, an overall algorithm is proposed for achieving co-evolution of process variants. Next, a prototype is developed for managing change synchronization between process variants and configurable process models. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed process change propagation method are verified based on experiments on two business process datasets. The experimental results show that our approach implements the co-evolution of process variants with high accuracy and efficiency.",2023-03-30T13:59:34Z,2023-03-30T13:59:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17388v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17388v1,"cs.SE, 68N99, D.2.2"
A class of CTRWs: Compound fractional Poisson processes,Enrico Scalas,"This chapter is an attempt to present a mathematical theory of compound fractional Poisson processes. The chapter begins with the characterization of a well-known L\'evy process: The compound Poisson process. The semi-Markov extension of the compound Poisson process naturally leads to the compound fractional Poisson process, where the Poisson counting process is replaced by the Mittag-Leffler counting process also known as fractional Poisson process. This process is no longer Markovian and L\'evy. However, several analytical results are available and some of them are discussed here. The functional limit of the compound Poisson process is an $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process, whereas in the case of the compound fractional Poisson process, one gets an $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process subordinated to the fractional Poisson process.",2011-03-03T10:34:03Z,2011-03-03T10:34:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0647v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.0647v1,"math.PR, q-fin.ST, 60G50 (Primary) 60G55 (Secondary)"
Full characterization of the fractional Poisson process,"Mauro Politi, Taisei Kaizoji, Enrico Scalas","The fractional Poisson process (FPP) is a counting process with independent and identically distributed inter-event times following the Mittag-Leffler distribution. This process is very useful in several fields of applied and theoretical physics including models for anomalous diffusion. Contrary to the well-known Poisson process, the fractional Poisson process does not have stationary and independent increments. It is not a L\'evy process and it is not a Markov process. In this letter, we present formulae for its finite-dimensional distribution functions, fully characterizing the process.

Gaussian and Sparse Processes Are Limits of Generalized Poisson   Processes,"Julien Fageot, Virginie Uhlmann, Michael Unser","The theory of sparse stochastic processes offers a broad class of statistical models to study signals. In this framework, signals are represented as realizations of random processes that are solution of linear stochastic differential equations driven by white L\'evy noises. Among these processes, generalized Poisson processes based on compound-Poisson noises admit an interpretation as random L-splines with random knots and weights. We demonstrate that every generalized L\'evy process-from Gaussian to sparse-can be understood as the limit in law of a sequence of generalized Poisson processes. This enables a new conceptual understanding of sparse processes and suggests simple algorithms for the numerical generation of such objects.",2017-02-16T14:57:26Z,2017-02-16T14:57:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05003v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05003v1,"math.PR, cs.IT, math.IT"

Generalized fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,"Kotaro Endo, Muneya Matsui","We introduce an extended version of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (FOU) process where the integrand is replaced by the exponential of an independent L\'evy process. We call the process the generalized fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (GFOU) process. Alternatively, the process can be constructed from a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (GOU) process using an independent fractional Brownian motion (FBM) as integrator. We show that the GFOU process is well-defined by checking the existence of the integral included in the process, and investigate its properties. It is proved that the process has a stationary version and exhibits long memory. We also find that the process satisfies a certain stochastic differential equation. Our underlying intention is to introduce long memory into the GOU process which has short memory without losing the possibility of jumps. Note that both FOU and GOU processes have found application in a variety of fields as useful alternatives to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process.",2008-07-14T08:26:38Z,2008-07-14T08:26:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2110v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.2110v1,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 60G10; 60G20; 60H10"
L√©vy models amenable to efficient calculations,"Svetlana Boyarchenko, Sergei Levendorskiƒ≠","In our previous publications (IJTAF 2019, Math. Finance 2020), we introduced a general class of SINH-regular processes and demonstrated that efficient numerical methods for the evaluation of the Wiener-Hopf factors and various probability distributions (prices of options of several types) in L\'evy models can be developed using only a few general properties of the characteristic exponent $\psi$. Essentially all popular L\'evy processes enjoy these properties. In the present paper, we define classes of Stieltjes-L\'evy processes (SL-processes) as processes with completely monotone L\'evy densities of positive and negative jumps, and signed Stieltjes-L\'evy processes (sSL-processes) as processes with densities representable as differences of completely monotone densities. We demonstrate that 1) all crucial properties of $\psi$ are consequences of the representation $\psi(\xi)=(a^+_2\xi^2-ia^+_1\xi)ST(\cG_+)(-i\xi)+(a^-_2\xi^2+ia^-_1\xi)ST(\cG_-)(i\xi)+(\sg^2/2)\xi^2-i\mu\xi$, where $ST(\cG)$ is the Stieltjes transform of the (signed) Stieltjes measure $\cG$ and $a^\pm_j\ge 0$; 2) essentially all popular processes other than Merton's model and Meixner processes areSL-processes; 3) Meixner processes are sSL-processes; 4) under a natural symmetry condition, essentially all popular classes of L\'evy processes are SL- or sSL-subordinated Brownian motion.",2022-07-05T23:29:04Z,2022-07-05T23:29:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02359v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02359v1,"math.PR, q-fin.CP, q-fin.MF, 6051, 60G52, 60-08, 65C05, 91G20"
Functional Limit Theorems for Hawkes Processes,"Ulrich Horst, Wei Xu","We prove that the long-run behavior of Hawkes processes is fully determined by the average number and the dispersion of child events. For subcritical processes we provide FLLNs and FCLTs under minimal conditions on the kernel of the process with the precise form of the limit theorems depending strongly on the dispersion of child events. For a critical Hawkes process with weakly dispersed child events, functional central limit theorems do not hold. Instead, we prove that the rescaled intensity processes and rescaled Hawkes processes behave like CIR-processes without mean-reversion, respectively integrated CIR-processes. We provide the rate of convergence by establishing an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of rescaled Hawkes process and the corresponding limit process. By contrast, critical Hawkes process with heavily dispersed child events share many properties of subcritical ones. In particular, functional limit theorems hold. However, unlike subcritical processes critical ones with heavily dispersed child events display long-range dependencies.",2024-01-21T13:59:13Z,2024-12-29T14:54:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11495v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11495v3,"math.PR, math.ST, q-fin.MF, stat.TH, Primary 60F17, 60G55, secondary 60J80"

A Technique for Determining Relevance Scores of Process Activities using   Graph-based Neural Networks,"Matthias Stierle, Sven Weinzierl, Maximilian Harl, Martin Matzner","Process models generated through process mining depict the as-is state of a process. Through annotations with metrics such as the frequency or duration of activities, these models provide generic information to the process analyst. To improve business processes with respect to performance measures, process analysts require further guidance from the process model. In this study, we design Graph Relevance Miner (GRM), a technique based on graph neural networks, to determine the relevance scores for process activities with respect to performance measures. Annotating process models with such relevance scores facilitates a problem-focused analysis of the business process, placing these problems at the centre of the analysis. We quantitatively evaluate the predictive quality of our technique using four datasets from different domains, to demonstrate the faithfulness of the relevance scores. Furthermore, we present the results of a case study, which highlight the utility of the technique for organisations.

These processes are defined in terms of fractional compound Poisson processes. Time-fractional Poisson process of order k naturally generalizes the Poisson process and Poisson process of order k to a heavy tailed waiting times counting process. The space-fractional Poisson process of order k, allows on average infinite number of arrivals in any interval.

Subsequently, it delves into renewal processes, regenerative processes, and finally, stationary regenerative processes, highlighting the results presented by Thorisson [22]. This work is not intended to be exhaustive but aims to provide a solid foundation for further deepening the knowledge of these processes, given their broad range of applications in cryptography [16], queueing theory [15], and Monte Carlo methods [23].

Differential Equations for Dyson Processes,"Craig A. Tracy, Harold Widom","We call ""Dyson process"" any process on ensembles of matrices in which the entries undergo diffusion. We are interested in the distribution of the eigenvalues (or singular values) of such matrices. In the original Dyson process it was the ensemble of n by n Hermitian matrices, and the eigenvalues describe n curves. Given sets X_1,...,X_m the probability that for each k no curve passes through X_k at time \tau_k is given by the Fredholm determinant of a certain matrix kernel, the extended Hermite kernel. For this reason we call this Dyson process the Hermite process. Similarly, when the entries of a complex matrix undergo diffusion we call the evolution of its singular values the Laguerre process, for which there is a corresponding extended Laguerre kernel. Scaling the Hermite process at the edge leads to the Airy process and in the bulk to the sine process; scaling the Laguerre process at the edge leads to the Bessel process. Generalizing and strengthening earlier work, we assume that each X_k is a finite union of intervals and find for the Airy process a system of partial differential equations, with the end-points of the intervals of the X_k as independent variables, whose solution determines the probability that for each k no curve passes through X_k at time \tau_k. Then we find the analogous systems for the Hermite process (which is more complicated) and also for the sine process. Finally we find an analogous system of PDEs for the Bessel process, which is the most difficult.",2003-09-04T21:04:33Z,2004-06-01T15:21:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0309082v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0309082v3,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP"

"Multiclass processes, dual points and M/M/1 queues","Pablo A. Ferrari, James B. Martin","We consider the discrete Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis process (HAD) and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in Z. The basic coupling induces a multiclass process which is useful in discussing shock measures and other important properties of the processes. The invariant measures of the multiclass systems are the same for both processes, and can be constructed as the law of the output process of a system of multiclass queues in tandem; the arrival and service processes of the queueing system are a collection of independent Bernoulli product measures. The proof of invariance involves a new coupling between stationary versions of the processes called a multi-line process; this process has a collection of independent Bernoulli product measures as an invariant measure. Some of these results have appeared elsewhere and this paper is partly a review, with some proofs given only in outline. However we emphasize a new approach via dual points: when the graphical construction is used to construct a trajectory of the TASEP or HAD process as a function of a Poisson process in ZxR, the dual points are those which govern the time-reversal of the trajectory. Each line of the multi-line process is governed by the dual points of the line below. We also mention some other processes whose multiclass versions have the same invariant measures, and we note an extension of Burke's theorem to multiclass queues which follows from the results.",2005-09-20T19:06:12Z,2005-09-20T19:06:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0509045v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0509045v1,"math-ph, math.MP, math.PR"
The impulse cutoff an entropy functional measure on trajectories of   Markov diffusion process integrating in information path functional,Vladimir S. Lerner,"The impulses, cutting entropy functional (EF) measure on trajectories Markov diffusion process, integrate information path functional (IPF) composing discrete information Bits extracted from observing random process. Each cut brings memory of the cutting entropy, which provides both reduction of the process entropy and discrete unit of the cutting entropy a Bit. Consequently, information is memorized entropy cutting in random observations which process interactions. The origin of information associates with anatomy creation of impulse enables both cut entropy and stipulate random process generating information under the cut. Memory of the impulse cutting time interval freezes the observing events dynamics in information processes. Diffusion process additive functional defines EF reducing it to a regular integral functional. Compared to Shannon entropy measure of random state, cutting process on separated states decreases quantity information concealed in the states correlation holding hidden process information. Infinite dimensional process cutoffs integrate finite information in IPF whose information approaches EF restricting process maximal information. Within the impulse reversible microprocess, conjugated entropy increments are entangling up to the cutoff converting entropy in irreversible information. Extracting maximum of minimal impulse information and transferring minimal entropy between impulses implement maxmin-minimax principle of optimal conversion process entropy to information. Macroprocess extremals integrate entropy of microprocess and cutoff information of impulses in the IPF information physical process. IPF measures Feller kernel information.

L√©vy processes with marked jumps II : Application to a population   model with mutations at birth,C√©cile Delaporte,"Consider a population where individuals give birth at constant rate during their lifetimes to i.i.d. copies of themselves. Individuals bear clonally inherited types, but (neutral) mutations may happen at the birth events. The smallest subtree containing the genealogy of all the extant individuals at a fixed time \tau, is called the coalescent point process. We enrich this process with the history of the mutations that appeared over time, and call it the marked coalescent point process. With the help of limit theorems for L\'evy processes with marked jumps established in a previous work (arXiv:1305.6245), we prove the convergence of the marked coalescent point process with large population size and two possible regimes for the mutations - one of them being a classical rare mutation regime, towards a multivariate Poisson point process. This Poisson point process can be described as the coalescent point process of the limiting population at \tau, with mutations arising as inhomogeneous regenerative sets along the lineages. Its intensity measure is further characterized thanks to the excursion theory for spectrally positive L\'evy processes. In the rare mutations asymptotic, mutations arise as the image of a Poisson process by the ladder height process of a L\'evy process with infinite variation, and in the particular case of the critical branching process with exponential lifetimes, the limiting object is the Poisson point process of the depths of excursions of the Brownian motion, with Poissonian mutations on the lineages.",2013-05-28T13:51:11Z,2013-05-28T13:51:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6491v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6491v1,"math.PR, q-bio.PE, 60J85, 60F17 (Primary) 92D25, 60G55, 60G51, 60J55 (Secondary)"
Student-t Processes as Alternatives to Gaussian Processes,"Amar Shah, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Zoubin Ghahramani","We investigate the Student-t process as an alternative to the Gaussian process as a nonparametric prior over functions. We derive closed form expressions for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process, by integrating away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process model. We show surprising equivalences between different hierarchical Gaussian process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive a new sampling scheme for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate these equivalences. Overall, we show that a Student-t process can retain the attractive properties of a Gaussian process -- a nonparametric representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions, and easy model selection through covariance kernels -- but has enhanced flexibility, and predictive covariances that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depend on the values of training observations. We verify empirically that a Student-t process is especially useful in situations where there are changes in covariance structure, or in applications like Bayesian optimization, where accurate predictive covariances are critical for good performance. These advantages come at no additional computational cost over Gaussian processes.",2014-02-18T11:47:38Z,2014-02-19T10:49:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4306v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4306v2,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ME"
"The continuum-of-urns scheme, generalized beta and Indian buffet   processes, and hierarchies thereof",Daniel M. Roy,"We describe the combinatorial stochastic process underlying a sequence of conditionally independent Bernoulli processes with a shared beta process hazard measure. As shown by Thibaux and Jordan [TJ07], in the special case when the underlying beta process has a constant concentration function and a finite and nonatomic mean, the combinatorial structure is that of the Indian buffet process (IBP) introduced by Griffiths and Ghahramani [GG05]. By reinterpreting the beta process introduced by Hjort [Hjo90] as a measurable family of Dirichlet processes, we obtain a simple predictive rule for the general case, which can be thought of as a continuum of Blackwell-MacQueen urn schemes (or equivalently, one-parameter Hoppe urn schemes). The corresponding measurable family of Perman-Pitman-Yor processes leads to a continuum of two-parameter Hoppe urn schemes, whose ordinary component is the three-parameter IBP introduced by Teh and G\""or\""ur [TG09], which exhibits power-law behavior, as further studied by Broderick, Jordan, and Pitman [BJP12]. The idea extends to arbitrary measurable families of exchangeable partition probability functions and gives rise to generalizations of the beta process with matching buffet processes.

Poisson process approximation for dependent superposition of point   processes,"Louis H. Y.

Appl. 115 (2005) 1819--1837] obtained error bounds for the weak convergence. Schuhmacher considered dependent superposition, truncated the individual point processes to 0--1 point processes and then applied Stein's method to the latter. In this paper, we adopt a different approach to the problem by using Palm theory and Stein's method, thereby expressing the error bounds in terms of the mean measures of the individual point processes, which is not possible with Schuhmacher's approach.

Adaptive Gaussian Predictive Process Approximation,Surya T Tokdar,"We address the issue of knots selection for Gaussian predictive process methodology. Predictive process approximation provides an effective solution to the cubic order computational complexity of Gaussian process models. This approximation crucially depends on a set of points, called knots, at which the original process is retained, while the rest is approximated via a deterministic extrapolation. Knots should be few in number to keep the computational complexity low, but provide a good coverage of the process domain to limit approximation error. We present theoretical calculations to show that coverage must be judged by the canonical metric of the Gaussian process. This necessitates having in place a knots selection algorithm that automatically adapts to the changes in the canonical metric affected by changes in the parameter values controlling the Gaussian process covariance function. We present an algorithm toward this by employing an incomplete Cholesky factorization with pivoting and dynamic stopping. Although these concepts already exist in the literature, our contribution lies in unifying them into a fast algorithm and in using computable error bounds to finesse implementation of the predictive process approximation. The resulting adaptive predictive process offers a substantial automatization of Guassian process model fitting, especially for Bayesian applications where thousands of values of the covariance parameters are to be explored.",2011-08-01T22:23:13Z,2011-08-01T22:23:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0445v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.0445v1,"stat.CO, stat.ME, stat.ML"
Locally Stationary Processes,Rainer Dahlhaus,The article contains an overview over locally stationary processes. At the beginning time varying autoregressive processes are discussed in detail - both as as a deep example and an important class of locally stationary processes. In the next section a general framework for time series with time varying finite dimensional parameters is discussed with special emphasis on nonlinear locally stationary processes. Then the paper focusses on linear processes where a more general theory is possible. First a general definition for linear processes is given and time varying spectral densities are discussed in detail. Then the Gaussian likelihood theory is presented for locally stationary processes. In the next section the relevance of empirical spectral processes for locally stationary time series is discussed. Empirical spectral processes play a major role in proving theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding of many techniques.

Marginal process framework: A model reduction tool for Markov jump   processes,"Leo Bronstein, Heinz Koeppl","Markov jump process models have many applications across science. Often, these models are defined on a state-space of product form and only one of the components of the process is of direct interest. In this paper, we extend the marginal process framework, which provides a marginal description of the component of interest, to the case of fully coupled processes. We use entropic matching to obtain a finite-dimensional approximation of the filtering equation, which governs the transition rates of the marginal process. The resulting equations can be seen as a combination of two projection operations applied to the full master equation, so that we obtain a principled model reduction framework. We demonstrate the resulting reduced description on the totally asymmetric exclusion process. An important class of Markov jump processes are stochastic reaction networks, which have applications in chemical and biomolecular kinetics, ecological models and models of social networks. We obtain a particularly simple instantiation of the marginal process framework for mass-action systems by using product-Poisson distributions for the approximate solution of the filtering equation.

Our results give a count analogue of the Indian buffet process, which we call a negative binomial Indian buffet process. As an intermediate step toward this goal, we provide a construction for the beta negative binomial process that avoids a representation of the underlying beta process base measure.

Exponential stability and asymptotic properties of the optimal filter   for signals with deterministic hyperbolic dynamics,"Lea Oljaƒça, Tobias Kuna, Jochen Br√∂cker","The problem of stability of the optimal filter is revisited. The optimal filter (or filtering process) is the conditional probability of the current state of some stochastic process (the signal process), given both present and past values of another process (the observation process). Typically the filtering process satisfies a dynamical equation, and the question investigated here concerns the stability of this dynamics. In contrast to previous work, signal processes given by the iterations of a deterministic mapping $f$ are considered, with only the initial condition being random. While the stability of the filter may emerge from strong randomness of the signal processes, different and more dynamical effects will be exploited in the present work. More specifically, we consider uniformly hyperbolic $f$ with strong instabilities providing the necessary mixing. This however requires that the filtering process is initialised with densities exhibiting already a certain level of smoothness. Furthermore, $f$ may also have stable directions along which the filtering process will eventually not have a density, a major technical difficulty. Further results show that the filtering process is asymptotically concentrated on the attractor and furthermore will have densities with respect to the invariant (SRB)~measure along instable manifolds of $f$.",2021-03-01T18:35:28Z,2021-03-01T18:35:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01190v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01190v1,"math.PR, math.DS, 60G35 (primary), 37D20 (secondary)"

This conversion happens in an exciton transfer (XT) process, and the electron moves away in an electron transfer(ET) process in multiple environments (baths). This XCET process plays an essential role in the harvesting of solar energy in biological and photovoltaic materials. We develop a practical theoretical model to study the efficiency of XCET process that occurs either in consecutive or concerted processes under the influence of non-Markovian baths. The role of quantum coherence in the XT-ET system and the baths is investigated using reduced hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM). This model includes independent baths for each XT and ET state, in addition to a XCET bath for the conversion process. We found that, while quantum system-bath coherence is important in the XT and ET processes, coherence between the XT and ET processes must be suppressed in order to realize efficient irreversible XCET process through the weak off-diagonal interaction between the XT and ET bridge sites arises from a XCET bath.",2017-10-17T23:57:33Z,2017-10-17T23:57:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06530v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06530v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.other, q-bio.BM"

We compute the partition functions of periodic Macdonald processes relying on the free field realization of the Macdonald theory. We also study several families of observables for periodic Macdonald processes and give formulas of their moments. The technical tool is the free field realization of operators that are diagonalized by the Macdonald symmetric functions, where the operators admit expressions by means of vertex operators. We show that, when we adopt Plancherel specializations, the corresponding periodic Macdonald process is related to a Young diagram-valued periodic continuous process.

Grouping Local Process Models,"Viki Peeva, Wil M. P. van der Aalst","In recent years, process mining emerged as a proven technology to analyze and improve operational processes. An expanding range of organizations using process mining in their daily operation brings a broader spectrum of processes to be analyzed. Some of these processes are highly unstructured, making it difficult for traditional process discovery approaches to discover a start-to-end model describing the entire process. Therefore, the subdiscipline of Local Process Model (LPM) discovery tries to build a set of LPMs, i.e., smaller models that explain sub-behaviors of the process. However, like other pattern mining approaches, LPM discovery algorithms also face the problems of model explosion and model repetition, i.e., the algorithms may create hundreds if not thousands of models, and subsets of them are close in structure or behavior. This work proposes a three-step pipeline for grouping similar LPMs using various process model similarity measures. We demonstrate the usefulness of grouping through a real-life case study, and analyze the impact of different measures, the gravity of repetition in the discovered LPMs, and how it improves after grouping on multiple real event logs.",2023-11-06T11:24:27Z,2023-11-06T11:24:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03040v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, I.5.3"
Random walks and Lorentz processes,Domokos Szasz,"Random walks and Lorentz processes serve as fundamental models for Brownian motion. The study of random walks is a favorite object of probability theory, whereas that of Lorentz processes belongs to the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems. Here, we first present examples where the method based on the probabilistic approach led to new insights into the study of the Lorentz process. Motivated by a 1981 question of Sinai about limiting laws for planar locally perturbed Lorentz processes, we first derived that, in the plane, local perturbations of homogeneous random walks leave the limit laws and the limiting processes unchanged - independently whether the walk had bounded or unbounded jumps. Afterward, we obtained probabilistic statements for local perturbations of planar Lorentz processes with finite horizon. (Similar statements for local perturbations of Lorentz processes with infinite horizon is a most interesting open problem!) Often an interesting consequence of a local limit theorem for a process is the recurrence of the same process. In this way, our approach also provides an alternative proof for a 2003 result of Lenci about the recurrence of the locally perturbed Lorentz processes with finite horizon.

A majority of process discovery techniques relies on an event log as an input. An event log is a static source of historical data capturing the execution of a business process. In this paper we focus on process discovery relying on online streams of business process execution events. Learning process models from event streams poses both challenges and opportunities, i.e. we need to handle unlimited amounts of data using finite memory and, preferably, constant time. We propose a generic architecture that allows for adopting several classes of existing process discovery techniques in context of event streams. Moreover, we provide several instantiations of the architecture, accompanied by implementations in the process mining tool-kit ProM (http://promtools.org).

We give necessary and sufficient conditions under the memory kernel function for the time-stationary and the Markov properties for these processes. When the GOU type process is driven by a L\'evy noise we prove that it is infinitely divisible showing its generating triplet. Several examples derived from the GOU type process are illustrated showing some of their basic properties as well as some time series realizations. These examples also present their theoretical and empirical autocorrelation or normalized codifference functions depending on whether the process has a finite or infinite second moment. We also present the maximum likelihood estimation as well as the Bayesian estimation procedures for the so-called \emph{Cosine process}, a particular process in the class of GOU type processes. For the Bayesian estimation method, we consider the power series representation of Fox's H-function to better approximate the density function of a random variable $\alpha$-stable distributed. We consider four goodness-of-fit tests for helping to decide which \emph{Cosine process} (driven by a Gaussian or an $\alpha$-stable noise) best fit real data sets.

Ambiguity Sparse Processes,Sofia Olhede,"This paper introduces the class of ambiguity sparse processes, containing subsets of popular nonstationary time series such as locally stationary, cyclostationary and uniformly modulated processes. The class also contains aggregations of the aforementioned processes. Ambiguity sparse processes are defined for a fixed sampling regime, in terms of a given number of sample points and a fixed sampling period. The framework naturally allows us to treat heterogeneously nonstationary processes, and to develop methodology for processes that have growing but controlled complexity with increasing sample sizes and shrinking sampling periods. Expressions for the moments of the sample ambiguity function are derived for ambiguity sparse processes. These properties inspire an Empirical Bayes shrinkage estimation procedure. The representation of the covariance structure of the process in terms of a time-frequency representation is separated from the estimation of these second order properties. The estimated ambiguity function is converted into an estimate of the time-varying moments of the process, and from these moments, any bilinear representation can be calculated with reduced estimation risk. Any of these representations can be used to understand the time-varying spectral content of the signal. The choice of representation is discussed. Parameters of the shrinkage procedure quantify the performance of the proposed estimation.",2011-03-21T07:51:31Z,2011-10-27T10:06:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3932v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.3932v2,"stat.ME, math.ST, stat.TH"

In this paper, we present two approaches to this construction, the transition-randomising approach and the time-change approach.

Unsupervised Event Abstraction using Pattern Abstraction and Local   Process Models,"Felix Mannhardt, Niek Tax","Process mining analyzes business processes based on events stored in event logs. However, some recorded events may correspond to activities on a very low level of abstraction. When events are recorded on a too low level of granularity, process discovery methods tend to generate overgeneralizing process models. Grouping low-level events to higher level activities, i.e., event abstraction, can be used to discover better process models. Existing event abstraction methods are mainly based on common sub-sequences and clustering techniques. In this paper, we propose to first discover local process models and then use those models to lift the event log to a higher level of abstraction. Our conjecture is that process models discovered on the obtained high-level event log return process models of higher quality: their fitness and precision scores are more balanced. We show this with preliminary results on several real-life event logs.",2017-04-11T20:08:14Z,2017-05-16T16:48:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03520v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03520v2,"cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.CL"
Generalized stealthy hyperuniform processes : maximal rigidity and the   bounded holes conjecture,"Subhro Ghosh, Joel L.

A key family of such processes are stealthy hyperuniform point processes, for which the origin $k=0$ is in $U$; these are of much current physical interest. We show that all such processes exhibit the following remarkable maximal rigidity : namely, the configuration outside a bounded region determines, with probability 1, the exact value (or the exact locations of the points) of the process inside the region. In particular, such processes are completely determined by their tail. In the 1D discrete setting (i.e. $\mathbb{Z}$-valued processes on $\mathbb{Z}$), this can also be seen as a consequence of a recent theorem of Borichev, Sodin and Weiss; in higher dimensions or in the continuum, such a phenomenon seems novel. For stealthy hyperuniform point processes, we prove the Zhang-Stillinger-Torquato conjecture that such processes have bounded holes (empty regions), with a universal bound that depends inversely on the size of $U$.",2017-07-13T21:19:23Z,2017-07-13T21:19:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04328v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04328v1,"math.PR, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"
Dunkl jump processes: relaxation and a phase transition,Sergio Andraus,"Dunkl processes are multidimensional Markov processes defined through the use of Dunkl operators. These processes have discontinuities, and they can be separated into their continuous (radial) part, and their discontinuous (jump) part. While radial Dunkl processes have been studied thoroughly due to their relationship to families of stochastic particle systems such as the Dyson model and Wishart-Laguerre processes, Dunkl jump processes have gone largely unnoticed after the initial work of Gallardo, Yor and Chybiryakov. We study the dynamical properties of these processes, and we derive their master equation. By calculating the asymptotic behavior of their total jump rate, we find that the jump processes of types $A_{N-1}$ and $B_N$ undergo a phase transition when the parameter $\beta$ decreases toward one in the bulk scaling limit. In addition, we show that the relaxation behavior of these processes is given by a non-trivial power law, and formulate a conjecture for the jump rate asymptotics based on numerical simulations.",2018-05-20T11:45:13Z,2019-12-17T03:49:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07755v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07755v4,"math-ph, math.MP, math.PR"

The BSP-Tree process is an almost surely right continuous Markov jump process that allows uniformly distributed oblique cuts in a two-dimensional convex polygon. The BSP-Tree process can also be extended using a non-uniform probability measure to generate direction differentiated cuts. The process is also self-consistent, maintaining distributional invariance under a restricted subdomain.

Intersection and proximity of processes of flats,"Daniel Hug, Christoph Thaele, Wolfgang Weil","Weakly stationary random processes of $k$-dimensional affine subspaces (flats) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are considered. If $2k\geq n$, then intersection processes are investigated, while in the complementary case $2k<n$ a proximity process is introduced. The intensity measures of these processes are described in terms of parameters of the underlying $k$-flat process. By a translation into geometric parameters of associated zonoids and by means of integral transformations, several new uniqueness and stability results for these processes of flats are derived. They rely on a combination of known and novel estimates for area measures of zonoids, which are also developed in the paper. Finally, an asymptotic second-order analysis as well as central and non-central limit theorems for length-power direction functionals of proximity processes derived from stationary Poisson $k$-flat process complement earlier works for intersection processes.",2014-06-16T12:58:28Z,2014-12-11T13:08:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3999v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3999v2,"math.MG, math.PR, Primary 44A15, 52A22, 60D05, Secondary 52A39, 53C65, 60F05, 60G55"
Modelling Quantum Mechanical Processes by Processes Energy Distribution   of Inner Oscillations of a Nanoparticle in the Phase Space,E. M. Beniaminov,"We consider the problem of computing energy distribution of inner harmonic oscillations of a nanoparticle in its phase space, when the particle moves in a medium in heat equilibrium under certain temperature. It is assumed that the particle obeys the Brownian motion under the action of the medium and the force field given by a potential function. In the present paper we provide and study an equation describing the problem, generalizing the Klein--Kramers equation. It is shown that for large value of medium resistance, the process of energy distribution of inner harmonic oscillations of the nanoparticle is represented as the composition of a rapid transition process and a slow process. After the rapid transition process, the system goes to a quasi-stationary state. The slow process is approximately described by the standard Schrodinger equation used for description ofquantum processes. Thus, the process being studied can serve as a model of quantum processes.",2016-10-03T13:21:03Z,2016-10-03T13:21:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00536v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00536v1,"math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph"
Point processes on directed linear network,"Jakob G. Rasmussen, Heidi S.

We adapt the so-called conditional intensity function used for specifying point processes on the time line to the setting of directed linear networks. For models specified by such a conditional intensity function, we derive an explicit expression for the likelihood function, specify two simulation algorithms (the inverse method and Ogata's modified thinning algorithm), and consider methods for model checking through the use of residuals. We also extend the results and methods to the case of a marked point process on a directed linear network. Furthermore, we consider specific classes of point process models on directed linear networks (Poisson processes, Hawkes processes, non-linear Hawkes processes, self-correcting processes, and marked Hawkes processes), all adapted from well-known models in the temporal setting.

Impact of Data Processing on Fairness in Supervised Learning,"Sajad Khodadadian, AmirEmad Ghassami, Negar Kiyavash","We study the impact of pre and post processing for reducing discrimination in data-driven decision makers. We first analyze the fundamental trade-off between fairness and accuracy in a pre-processing approach, and propose a design for a pre-processing module based on a convex optimization program, which can be added before the original classifier. This leads to a fundamental lower bound on attainable discrimination, given any acceptable distortion in the outcome. Furthermore, we reformulate an existing post-processing method in terms of our accuracy and fairness measures, which allows comparing post-processing and pre-processing approaches. We show that under some mild conditions, pre-processing outperforms post-processing. Finally, we show that by appropriate choice of the discrimination measure, the optimization problem for both pre and post processing approaches will reduce to a linear program and hence can be solved efficiently.",2021-02-03T04:11:39Z,2021-02-03T04:11:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01867v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01867v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IT, math.IT"
Quantifying Quantum-Mechanical Processes,"Jen-Hsiang Hsieh, Shih-Hsuan Chen, Che-Ming Li","The act of describing how a physical process changes a system is the basis for understanding observed phenomena. For quantum-mechanical processes in particular, the affect of processes on quantum states profoundly advances our knowledge of the natural world, from understanding counter-intuitive concepts to the development of wholly quantum-mechanical technology. Here, we show that quantum-mechanical processes can be quantified using a generic classical-process model through which any classical strategies of mimicry can be ruled out. We demonstrate the success of this formalism using fundamental processes postulated in quantum mechanics, the dynamics of open quantum systems, quantum-information processing, the fusion of entangled photon pairs, and the energy transfer in a photosynthetic pigment-protein complex. Since our framework does not depend on any specifics of the states being processed, it reveals a new class of correlations in the hierarchy between entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and paves the way for the elaboration of a generic method for quantifying physical processes.",2017-10-19T10:28:27Z,2017-10-19T10:28:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07068v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07068v1,"quant-ph, physics.bio-ph, physics.class-ph"
Global rigidity and exponential moments for soft and hard edge point   processes,"Christophe Charlier, Tom Claeys","We establish sharp global rigidity upper bounds for universal determinantal point processes describing edge eigenvalues of random matrices. For this, we first obtain a general result which can be applied to general (not necessarily determinantal) point processes which have a smallest (or largest) point: it allows to deduce global rigidity upper bounds from the exponential moments of the counting function of the process. By combining this with known exponential moment asymptotics for the Airy and Bessel point processes, we improve on the best known upper bounds for the global rigidity of the Airy point process, and we obtain new global rigidity results for the Bessel point process.   Secondly, we obtain exponential moment asymptotics for the Wright's generalized Bessel process and the Meijer-$\mathrm{G}$ process, up to and including the constant term. As a direct consequence, we obtain new results for the expectation and variance of the associated counting functions. Furthermore, by combining these asymptotics with our general rigidity theorem, we obtain new global rigidity upper bounds for these point processes.",2020-02-10T14:58:59Z,2020-03-03T14:35:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03833v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03833v2,"math-ph, math.MP, math.PR"
Comparing Deadlock-Free Session Typed Processes,"Ornela Dardha, Jorge A. P√©rez","Besides respecting prescribed protocols, communication-centric systems should never ""get stuck"". This requirement has been expressed by liveness properties such as progress or (dead)lock freedom. Several typing disciplines that ensure these properties for mobile processes have been proposed. Unfortunately, very little is known about the precise relationship between these disciplines--and the classes of typed processes they induce.   In this paper, we compare L and K, two classes of deadlock-free, session typed concurrent processes. The class L stands out for its canonicity: it results naturally from interpretations of linear logic propositions as session types. The class K, obtained by encoding session types into Kobayashi's usage types, includes processes not typable in other type systems.   We show that L is strictly included in K. We also identify the precise condition under which L and K coincide. One key observation is that the degree of sharing between parallel processes determines a new expressiveness hierarchy for typed processes. We also provide a type-preserving rewriting procedure of processes in K into processes in L. This procedure suggests that, while effective, the degree of sharing is a rather subtle criteria for distinguishing typed processes.",2015-08-27T03:21:08Z,2015-08-27T03:21:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06707v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06707v1,"cs.LO, cs.PL, F.3.2"

Remarks on multivariate Gaussian Process,"Zexun Chen, Jun Fan, Kuo Wang","Gaussian processes occupy one of the leading places in modern statistics and probability theory due to their importance and a wealth of strong results. The common use of Gaussian processes is in connection with problems related to estimation, detection, and many statistical or machine learning models. With the fast development of Gaussian process applications, it is necessary to consolidate the fundamentals of vector-valued stochastic processes, in particular multivariate Gaussian processes, which is the essential theory for many applied problems with multiple correlated responses. In this paper, we propose a precise definition of multivariate Gaussian processes based on Gaussian measures on vector-valued function spaces, and provide an existence proof. In addition, several fundamental properties of multivariate Gaussian processes, such as strict stationarity and independence, are introduced. We further derive multivariate Brownian motion including It\^o lemma as a special case of a multivariate Gaussian process, and present a brief introduction to multivariate Gaussian process regression as a useful statistical learning method for multi-output prediction problems.",2020-10-19T20:10:17Z,2021-02-24T17:04:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09830v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09830v3,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH"

The process starts with an arbitrary given $n$-vertex graph $G_0$. In each step, the graph $G_i$ is obtained by sampling $k$ random vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ of $G_{i-1}$ and replacing the induced graph $G_{i-1}[v_1,\ldots,v_k]$ by $\mathcal{R}(G_{i-1}[v_1,\ldots,v_k])$.

Milner's Proof System for Regular Expressions Modulo Bisimilarity is   Complete (Crystallization: Near-Collapsing Process Graph Interpretations of   Regular Expressions),Clemens Grabmayer,"Milner (1984) defined a process semantics for regular expressions. He formulated a sound proof system for bisimilarity of process interpretations of regular expressions, and asked whether this system is complete.   We report conceptually on a proof that shows that Milner's system is complete, by motivating, illustrating, and describing all of its main steps. We substantially refine the completeness proof by Grabmayer and Fokkink (2020) for the restriction of Milner's system to `1-free' regular expressions. As a crucial complication we recognize that process graphs with empty-step transitions that satisfy the layered loop-existence/elimination property LLEE are not closed under bisimulation collapse (unlike process graphs with LLEE that only have proper-step transitions). We circumnavigate this obstacle by defining a LLEE-preserving `crystallization procedure' for such process graphs. By that we obtain `near-collapsed' process graphs with LLEE whose strongly connected components are either collapsed or of `twin-crystal' shape. Such near-collapsed process graphs guarantee provable solutions for bisimulation collapses of process interpretations of regular expressions.",2022-09-25T09:47:42Z,2022-11-09T13:03:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12188v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12188v2,"cs.LO, cs.FL, F.4.1"

Our proof technique gives easily an hitting time result i.e, with high probability, the $k$th cohomology becomes trivial when there are no more isolated $k$-faces. Our results imply that the thresholds for vanishing of cohomology of the clique complex process coincides with that of the threshold for vanishing of `instantaneous' homology determined by \citet{SVT}.

Collision times of multivariate Bessel processes with their Weyl   chambers' boundaries and their Hausdorff dimension,"Nicole Hufnagel, Sergio Andraus","Multivariate Bessel processes, otherwise known as radial Dunkl processes, are stochastic processes defined in a Weyl chamber that are repelled from the latter's boundary by a singular drift with a strength given by the multiplicity function $k$. It is a well-known fact that when $k$ is sufficiently small, these processes hit the Weyl chamber's boundary almost surely, and it was recently shown by the authors that the collision times for the process of type $A$, also known as the Dyson model (a one-dimensional multiple-particle stochastic system), have a Hausdorff dimension that depends on $k$. In this paper, we use the square of the alternating polynomial, which corresponds to the reflection group of the process, to extend this result to all multivariate Bessel processes of rational type, and we show that the Hausdorff dimension of collision times is a piecewise-linear function of the minimum of $k$, but is independent of the dimension of the space where the process lives. This implies that the Hausdorff dimension is independent of the particle number for processes with a particle system representation.",2023-12-09T00:29:20Z,2023-12-09T00:29:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05420v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05420v1,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP, 60G18(primary), 28A78, 33C52, 82C22, 82M60(secondary)"
Non-Parametric Estimation of Multi-dimensional Marked Hawkes Processes,"Sobin Joseph, Shashi Jain","An extension of the Hawkes process, the Marked Hawkes process distinguishes itself by featuring variable jump size across each event, in contrast to the constant jump size observed in a Hawkes process without marks. While extensive literature has been dedicated to the non-parametric estimation of both the linear and non-linear Hawkes process, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the marked Hawkes process. In response to this, we propose a methodology for estimating the conditional intensity of the marked Hawkes process. We introduce two distinct models: \textit{Shallow Neural Hawkes with marks}- for Hawkes processes with excitatory kernels and \textit{Neural Network for Non-Linear Hawkes with Marks}- for non-linear Hawkes processes. Both these approaches take the past arrival times and their corresponding marks as the input to obtain the arrival intensity. This approach is entirely non-parametric, preserving the interpretability associated with the marked Hawkes process. To validate the efficacy of our method, we subject the method to synthetic datasets with known ground truth. Additionally, we apply our method to model cryptocurrency order book data, demonstrating its applicability to real-world scenarios.",2024-02-07T10:51:11Z,2024-02-07T10:51:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04740v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04740v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, q-fin.CP, q-fin.ST"
Control-flow Reconstruction Attacks on Business Process Models,"Henrik Kirchmann, Stephan A.

While such models generalize over the control-flow of specific, recorded process executions, they are often also annotated with behavioural statistics, such as execution frequencies.Based thereon, once a model is published, certain insights about the original process executions may be reconstructed, so that an external party may extract confidential information about the business process. This work is the first to empirically investigate such reconstruction attempts based on process models. To this end, we propose different play-out strategies that reconstruct the control-flow from process trees, potentially exploiting frequency annotations. To assess the potential success of such reconstruction attacks on process models, and hence the risks imposed by publishing them, we compare the reconstructed process executions with those of the original log for several real-world datasets.",2024-09-17T08:42:55Z,2024-09-17T08:42:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10986v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10986v1,"cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.SE"
Modeling stationary data by a class of generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck   processes,"Argimiro Arratia, Alejandra Caba√±a, Enrique M.

Departing from this fact, we analyse in this work the effect of iterating OU treated as a linear operator that maps a Wiener process onto Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, so as to build a family of higher order Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, OU$(p)$, in a similar spirit as the higher order autoregressive processes AR$(p)$. We show that for $p \ge 2$ we obtain in general a process with covariances different than those of an AR$(p)$, and that for various continuous time processes, sampled from real data at equally spaced time instants, the OU$(p)$ model outperforms the appropriate AR$(p)$ model.   Technically our composition of the OU operator is easy to manipulate and its parameters can be computed efficiently because, as we show, the iteration of OU operators leads to a process that can be expressed as a linear combination of basic OU processes. Using this expression we obtain a closed formula for the covariance of the iterated OU process, and consequently estimate the parameters of an OU$(p)$ process by maximum likelihood or, as an alternative, by matching correlations, the latter being a procedure resembling the method of moments.",2012-10-01T08:54:21Z,2012-10-01T08:54:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0312v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.0312v1,"math.ST, math-ph, math.MP, stat.TH, 60G10, 60G15, 60G20"
Likelihood Inference for a Functional Marked Point Process with   Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Process Marks,Ottmar Cronie,"This paper considers maximum likelihood inference for a functional marked point process - the stochastic growth-interaction process - which is an extension of the spatio-temporal growth-interaction process to the stochastic mark setting. As a pilot study we here consider a particular version of this extended process, which has a homogenous Poisson process as unmarked point process and shifted independent Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes as functional marks. These marks have supports determined by the lifetimes generated by an immigration-death process. By considering a (temporally) discrete sample scheme for the marks and by considering the process' alternative evolutionary representation as a multivariate diffusion (Markovian) with jumps, the likelihood function is expressed as a product of the process' closed form transition densities. Additionally, under the assumption that the mark processes are started in their common stationary distribution, and under some restrictions on the underlying parameters, consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators are proved. The ML-estimators derived from the stationarity assumption are then compared numerically to the ML-estimators derived under non-stationarity, in order to investigate the robustness of the stationarity assumption.

Nonequilibrium Markov processes conditioned on large deviations,"Raphael Chetrite, Hugo Touchette","We consider the problem of conditioning a Markov process on a rare event and of representing this conditioned process by a conditioning-free process, called the effective or driven process. The basic assumption is that the rare event used in the conditioning is a large deviation-type event, characterized by a convex rate function. Under this assumption, we construct the driven process via a generalization of Doob's $h$-transform, used in the context of bridge processes, and show that this process is equivalent to the conditioned process in the long-time limit. The notion of equivalence that we consider is based on the logarithmic equivalence of path measures and implies that the two processes have the same typical states. In constructing the driven process, we also prove equivalence with the so-called exponential tilting of the Markov process, which is used with importance sampling to simulate rare events, and which gives rise, from the point of view of statistical mechanics, to a nonequilibrium version of the canonical ensemble.

Current inference schemes for models involving the gamma process are restricted to MCMC-based methods, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we present a variational inference framework for models involving gamma process priors. Our approach is based on a novel stick-breaking constructive definition of the gamma process. We prove correctness of this stick-breaking process by using the characterization of the gamma process as a completely random measure (CRM), and we explicitly derive the rate measure of our construction using Poisson process machinery. We also derive error bounds on the truncation of the infinite process required for variational inference, similar to the truncation analyses for other nonparametric models based on the Dirichlet and beta processes. Our representation is then used to derive a variational inference algorithm for a particular Bayesian nonparametric latent structure formulation known as the infinite Gamma-Poisson model, where the latent variables are drawn from a gamma process prior with Poisson likelihoods.

Evaluating Conformance Measures in Process Mining using Conformance   Propositions (Extended version),"Anja F. Syring, Niek Tax, Wil M.

Conformance checking is concerned with quantifying the quality of a business process model in relation to event data that was logged during the execution of the business process. There exist different categories of conformance measures. Recall, also called fitness, is concerned with quantifying how much of the behavior that was observed in the event log fits the process model. Precision is concerned with quantifying how much behavior a process model allows for that was never observed in the event log. Generalization is concerned with quantifying how well a process model generalizes to behavior that is possible in the business process but was never observed in the event log. Many recall, precision, and generalization measures have been developed throughout the years, but they are often defined in an ad-hoc manner without formally defining the desired properties up front. To address these problems, we formulate 21 conformance propositions and we use these propositions to evaluate current and existing conformance measures. The goal is to trigger a discussion by clearly formulating the challenges and requirements (rather than proposing new measures). Additionally, this paper serves as an overview of the conformance checking measures that are available in the process mining area.",2019-08-30T19:04:18Z,2019-08-30T19:04:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02393v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02393v1,"cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.ML"
Point process simulation of generalised inverse Gaussian processes and   estimation of the Jaeger integral,"Simon Godsill, Yaman Kƒ±ndap","In this paper novel simulation methods are provided for the generalised inverse Gaussian (GIG) L\'{e}vy process. Such processes are intractable for simulation except in certain special edge cases, since the L\'{e}vy density associated with the GIG process is expressed as an integral involving certain Bessel Functions, known as the Jaeger integral in diffusive transport applications. We here show for the first time how to solve the problem indirectly, using generalised shot-noise methods to simulate the underlying point processes and constructing an auxiliary variables approach that avoids any direct calculation of the integrals involved. The resulting augmented bivariate process is still intractable and so we propose a novel thinning method based on upper bounds on the intractable integrand. Moreover our approach leads to lower and upper bounds on the Jaeger integral itself, which may be compared with other approximation methods. The shot noise method involves a truncated infinite series of decreasing random variables, and as such is approximate, although the series are found to be rapidly convergent in most cases. We note that the GIG process is the required Brownian motion subordinator for the generalised hyperbolic (GH) L\'{e}vy process and so our simulation approach will straightforwardly extend also to the simulation of these intractable proceses. Our new methods will find application in forward simulation of processes of GIG and GH type, in financial and engineering data, for example, as well as inference for states and parameters of stochastic processes driven by GIG and GH L\'{e}vy processes.",2021-05-19T22:48:55Z,2021-11-24T16:55:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09429v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09429v3,"stat.ME, eess.SP, math.PR"

The decision-maker observes a subset of the processes at any given time instant and obtains a noisy binary indicator of whether or not the corresponding process is anomalous. In this setting, we develop an anomaly detection algorithm that chooses the processes to be observed at a given time instant, decides when to stop taking observations, and declares the decision on anomalous processes. The objective of the detection algorithm is to identify the anomalies with an accuracy exceeding the desired value while minimizing the delay in decision making. We devise a centralized algorithm where the processes are jointly selected by a common agent as well as a decentralized algorithm where the decision of whether to select a process is made independently for each process. Our algorithms rely on a Markov decision process defined using the marginal probability of each process being normal or anomalous, conditioned on the observations. We implement the detection algorithms using the deep actor-critic reinforcement learning framework.

Biased processing and opinion polarization: experimental refinement of   argument communication theory in the context of the energy debate,"Sven Banisch, Hawal Shamon","In sociological research, the study of macro processes, such as opinion polarization, faces a fundamental problem, the so-called micro-macro problem. To overcome this problem, we combine empirical experimental research on biased argument processing with a computational theory of group deliberation in order to clarify the role of biased processing in debates around energy. The experiment reveals a strong tendency to consider arguments aligned with the current attitude more persuasive and to downgrade those speaking against it. This is integrated into the framework of argument communication theory in which agents exchange arguments about a certain topic and adapt opinions accordingly. We derive a mathematical model that allows to relate the strength of biased processing to expected attitude changes given the specific experimental conditions and find a clear signature of moderate biased processing. We further show that this model fits significantly better to the experimentally observed attitude changes than the neutral argument processing assumption made in previous models. Our approach provides new insight into the relationship between biased processing and opinion polarization. At the individual level our analysis reveals a sharp qualitative transition from attitude moderation to polarization. At the collective level we find (i.) that weak biased processing significantly accelerates group decision processes whereas (ii.) strong biased processing leads to a persistent conflictual state of subgroup polarization. While this shows that biased processing alone is sufficient for the emergence of polarization, we also demonstrate that homophily may lead to intra-group conflict at significantly lower rates of biased processing.",2022-12-20T09:35:53Z,2022-12-20T09:35:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10117v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10117v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.CY, cs.MA, nlin.AO"
Optimizing Sepsis Care through Heuristics Methods in Process Mining: A   Trajectory Analysis,"Alireza Bakhshi, Erfan Hassannayebi, Amir Hossein Sadeghi","Process mining can help acquire insightful knowledge and heighten the system's performance. In this study, we surveyed the trajectories of 1050 sepsis patients in a regional hospital in the Netherlands from the registration to the discharge phase. Based on this real-world case study, the event log comprises events and activities related to the emergency ward, admission to hospital wards, and discharge enriched with data from lab experiments and triage checklists. At first, we aim to discover this process through Heuristics Miner (HM) and Inductive Miner (IM) methods. Then, we analyze a systematic process model based on organizational information and knowledge. Besides, we address conformance checking given medical guidelines for these patients and monitor the related flows on the systematic process model. The results show that HM and IM are inadequate in identifying the relevant process. However, using a systematic process model based on expert knowledge and organizational information resulted in an average fitness of 97.8%, a simplicity of 77.7%, and a generalization of 80.2%. The analyses demonstrate that process mining can shed light on the patient flow in the hospital and inspect the day-to-day clinical performance versus medical guidelines. Also, the process models obtained by the HM and IM methods cannot provide a concrete comprehension of the process structure for stakeholders compared to the systematic process model. The implications of our findings include the potential for process mining to improve the quality of healthcare services, optimize resource allocation, and reduce costs. Our study also highlights the importance of considering expert knowledge and organizational information in developing effective process models.",2023-03-25T02:05:03Z,2023-03-25T02:05:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14328v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14328v1,"cs.CY, cs.SY, eess.SY"
"Causal Inference on Process Graphs, Part I: The Structural Equation   Process Representation","Nicolas-Domenic Reiter, Andreas Gerhardus, Jonas Wahl, Jakob Runge","When dealing with time series data, causal inference methods often employ structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) processes to model time-evolving random systems. In this work, we rephrase recursive SVAR processes with possible latent component processes as a linear Structural Causal Model (SCM) of stochastic processes on a simple causal graph, the process graph, that models every process as a single node. Using this reformulation, we generalise Wright's well-known path-rule for linear Gaussian SCMs to the newly introduced process SCMs and we express the auto-covariance sequence of an SVAR process by means of a generalised trek-rule. Employing the Fourier-Transformation, we derive compact expressions for causal effects in the frequency domain that allow us to efficiently visualise the causal interactions in a multivariate SVAR process. Finally, we observe that the process graph can be used to formulate graphical criteria for identifying causal effects and to derive algebraic relations with which these frequency domain causal effects can be recovered from the observed spectral density.",2023-05-19T09:58:10Z,2024-08-16T08:22:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11561v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11561v3,"math.ST, stat.ME, stat.TH"
Bridging Both Worlds in Semantics and Time: Domain Knowledge Based   Analysis and Correlation of Industrial Process Attacks,"Moses Ike, Kandy Phan, Anwesh Badapanda, Matthew Landen, Keaton Sadoski, Wanda Guo, Asfahan Shah, Saman Zonouz, Wenke Lee","Modern industrial control systems (ICS) attacks infect supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) hosts to stealthily alter industrial processes, causing damage. To detect attacks with low false alarms, recent work detects attacks in both SCADA and process data. Unfortunately, this led to the same problem - disjointed (false) alerts, due to the semantic and time gap in SCADA and process behavior, i.e., SCADA execution does not map to process dynamics nor evolve at similar time scales. We propose BRIDGE to analyze and correlate SCADA and industrial process attacks using domain knowledge to bridge their unique semantic and time evolution. This enables operators to tie malicious SCADA operations to their adverse process effects, which reduces false alarms and improves attack understanding. BRIDGE (i) identifies process constraints violations in SCADA by measuring actuation dependencies in SCADA process-control, and (ii) detects malicious SCADA effects in processes via a physics-informed neural network that embeds generic knowledge of inertial process dynamics. BRIDGE then dynamically aligns both analysis (i and ii) in a time-window that adjusts their time evolution based on process inertial delays. We applied BRIDGE to 11 diverse real-world industrial processes, and adaptive attacks inspired by past events. BRIDGE correlated 98.3% of attacks with 0.8% false positives (FP), compared to 78.3% detection accuracy and 13.7% FP of recent work.",2023-11-30T13:21:13Z,2023-12-03T18:02:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18539v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18539v2,"cs.CR, cs.SY, eess.SY"

High moment partial sum processes of residuals in GARCH models and their   applications,"Reg Kulperger, Hao Yu","In this paper we construct high moment partial sum processes based on residuals of a GARCH model when the mean is known to be 0. We consider partial sums of $k$th powers of residuals, CUSUM processes and self-normalized partial sum processes. The $k$th power partial sum process converges to a Brownian process plus a correction term, where the correction term depends on the $k$th moment $\mu_k$ of the innovation sequence. If $\mu_k=0$, then the correction term is 0 and, thus, the $k$th power partial sum process converges weakly to the same Gaussian process as does the $k$th power partial sum of the i.i.d. innovations sequence. In particular, since $\mu_1=0$, this holds for the first moment partial sum process, but fails for the second moment partial sum process. We also consider the CUSUM and the self-normalized processes, that is, standardized by the residual sample variance. These behave as if the residuals were asymptotically i.i.d. We also study the joint distribution of the $k$th and $(k+1)$st self-normalized partial sum processes. Applications to change-point problems and goodness-of-fit are considered, in particular, CUSUM statistics for testing GARCH model structure change and the Jarque--Bera omnibus statistic for testing normality of the unobservable innovation distribution of a GARCH model.

Hidden information and regularities of information dynamics IR,Vladimir S. Lerner,"The introduced entropy functional's (EF) information measure of random process integrates multiple information contributions along the process trajectories, evaluating both the states' and between states' bound information connections. This measure reveals information that is hidden by traditional information measures, which commonly use Shannon's entropy function for each selected stationary states of the process. The hidden information is important for evaluation of missing connections, disclosing the process' meaningful information, which enables producing logic of the information. The presentation consists of three Parts. In Part 1R-revised we analyze mechanism of arising information regularities from a stochastic process, measured by EF, independently of the process' specific source and origin. Uncovering the process' regularities leads us to an information law, based on extracting maximal information from its minimum, which could create these regularities. The solved variation problem (VP) determines a dynamic process, measured by information path functional (IPF), and information dynamic model, approximating the EF measured stochastic process with a maximal functional probability on trajectories. In Part 2, we study the cooperative processes, arising at the consolidation, as a result of the VP-EF-IPF approach, which is able to produce multiple cooperative structures, concurrently assembling in hierarchical information network (IN) and generating the IN's digital genetic code. In Part 3 we study the evolutionary information processes and regularities of evolution dynamics, evaluated by the entropy functional (EF) of random field and informational path functional of a dynamic space-time process. The information law and the regularities determine unified functional informational mechanisms of evolution dynamics.",2012-07-22T22:33:40Z,2013-01-18T23:14:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5265v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5265v3,"nlin.AO, cs.IT, math.IT, 58J65, 60J65, 93B52, 93E02, 93E15, 93E30, H.1.1"

Can bio-inspired information processing steps be realized as synthetic   biochemical processes?,"Vladimir Privman, Evgeny Katz","We consider possible designs and experimental realiza-tions in synthesized rather than naturally occurring bio-chemical systems of a selection of basic bio-inspired information processing steps. These include feed-forward loops, which have been identified as the most common information processing motifs in many natural pathways in cellular functioning, and memory-involving processes, specifically, associative memory. Such systems should not be designed to literally mimic nature. Rather, we can be guided by nature's mechanisms for experimenting with new information/signal processing steps which are based on coupled biochemical reactions, but are vastly simpler than natural processes, and which will provide tools for the long-term goal of understanding and harnessing nature's information processing paradigm. Our biochemical processes of choice are enzymatic cascades because of their compatibility with physiological processes in vivo and with electronics (e.g., electrodes) in vitro allowing for networking and interfacing of enzyme-catalyzed processes with other chemical and biochemical reactions. In addition to designing and realizing feed-forward loops and other processes, one has to develop approaches to probe their response to external control of the time-dependence of the input(s), by measuring the resulting time-dependence of the output. The goal will be to demonstrate the expected features, for example, the delayed response and stabilizing effect of the feed-forward loops.",2014-11-07T13:58:31Z,2014-11-07T13:58:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1917v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1917v1,"q-bio.MN, cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph"
Conformance Checking Based on Multi-Perspective Declarative Process   Models,"Andrea Burattin, Fabrizio Maria Maggi, Alessandro Sperduti","Process mining is a family of techniques that aim at analyzing business process execution data recorded in event logs. Conformance checking is a branch of this discipline embracing approaches for verifying whether the behavior of a process, as recorded in a log, is in line with some expected behaviors provided in the form of a process model. The majority of these approaches require the input process model to be procedural (e.g., a Petri net). However, in turbulent environments, characterized by high variability, the process behavior is less stable and predictable. In these environments, procedural process models are less suitable to describe a business process. Declarative specifications, working in an open world assumption, allow the modeler to express several possible execution paths as a compact set of constraints. Any process execution that does not contradict these constraints is allowed. One of the open challenges in the context of conformance checking with declarative models is the capability of supporting multi-perspective specifications. In this paper, we close this gap by providing a framework for conformance checking based on MP-Declare, a multi-perspective version of the declarative process modeling language Declare. The approach has been implemented in the process mining tool ProM and has been experimented in three real life case studies.",2015-03-17T09:09:30Z,2015-03-17T09:09:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04957v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04957v1,"cs.SE, cs.DB, cs.LO"
Implicit Recursive Characteristics of STOP,Mike H. Ji,"The most important notations of Communicating Sequential Process(CSP) are the process and the prefix (event)$\rightarrow$(process) operator. While we can formally apply the $\rightarrow$ operator to define a live process's behavior, the STOP process, which usually resulted from deadlock, starving or livelock, is lack of formal description, defined by most literatures as ""doing nothing but halt"". In this paper, we argue that the STOP process should not be considered as a black box, it should follow the prefix $\rightarrow$ schema and the same inference rules so that a unified and consistent process algebra model can be established. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce a special event called ""nil"" that any process can take. This nil event will do nothing meaningful and leave nothing on a process's observable record. With the nil event and its well-defined rules, we can successfully use the $\rightarrow$ operator to formally describe a process's complete behavior in its whole life circle. More interestingly, we can use prefix $\rightarrow$ and nil event to fully describe the STOP process's internal behavior and conclude that the STOP's formal equation can be given as simple as STOP$_{\alpha X} = \mu$ X. nil $\rightarrow$ X.",2019-08-19T05:43:13Z,2019-08-21T03:22:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06601v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06601v2,"cs.PL, cs.CL, cs.FL, cs.LO"
Multiple-particle diffusion processes from the viewpoint of Dunkl   operators: relaxation to the steady state,Sergio Andraus,"Two families of stochastic interacting particle systems, the interacting Brownian motions and Bessel processes, are defined as extensions of Dyson's Brownian motion models and the eigenvalue processes of the Wishart and Laguerre processes where the parameter $\beta$ from random matrix theory is taken as a real positive number. These are systems where several particles evolve as individual Brownian motions and Bessel processes while repelling mutually through a logarithmic potential. These systems are also special cases of Dunkl processes, a broad family of multivariate stochastic processes defined by using Dunkl operators. In this thesis, the steady state under an appropriate scaling and and the freezing ($\beta\to\infty$) regime of the interacting Brownian motions and Bessel processes are studied, and it is proved that the scaled steady-state distributions of these processes converge in finite time to the eigenvalue distributions of the $\beta$-Hermite and $\beta$-Laguerre ensembles of random matrices. It is also shown that the scaled final positions of the particles in these processes are fixed at the zeroes of the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials in the freezing limit. These results are obtained as the consequence of two more general results proved in this thesis. The first is that Dunkl processes in general converge in finite time to a scaled steady-state distribution that only depends on the type of Dunkl process considered. The second is that in the freezing limit, their scaled final position is fixed to a set of points called the peak set, which is the set of points which maximizes their steady-state distribution.",2014-06-06T08:49:23Z,2014-06-06T08:49:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1610v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1610v1,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.MP"
Statistical Signatures of Structural Organization: The case of long   memory in renewal processes,"Sarah E. Marzen, James P. Crutchfield","Identifying and quantifying memory are often critical steps in developing a mechanistic understanding of stochastic processes. These are particularly challenging and necessary when exploring processes that exhibit long-range correlations. The most common signatures employed rely on second-order temporal statistics and lead, for example, to identifying long memory in processes with power-law autocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$. However, most stochastic processes hide their memory in higher-order temporal correlations. Information measures---specifically, divergences in the mutual information between a process' past and future (excess entropy) and minimal predictive memory stored in a process' causal states (statistical complexity)---provide a different way to identify long memory in processes with higher-order temporal correlations. However, there are no ergodic stationary processes with infinite excess entropy for which information measures have been compared to autocorrelation functions and Hurst exponents. Here, we show that fractal renewal processes---those with interevent distribution tails $\propto t^{-\alpha}$---exhibit long memory via a phase transition at $\alpha = 1$. Excess entropy diverges only there and statistical complexity diverges there and for all $\alpha < 1$. When these processes do have power-law autocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$, they do not have divergent excess entropy. This analysis breaks the intuitive association between these different quantifications of memory. We hope that the methods used here, based on causal states, provide some guide as to how to construct and analyze other long memory processes.",2015-12-06T23:30:32Z,2015-12-06T23:30:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01859v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01859v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.IT, math.DS, math.IT, math.ST, physics.data-an, stat.TH"
Coarse-Graining Open Markov Processes,"John C. Baez, Kenny Courser","Coarse-graining is a standard method of extracting a simple Markov process from a more complicated one by identifying states. Here we extend coarse-graining to open Markov processes. An ""open"" Markov process is one where probability can flow in or out of certain states called ""inputs"" and ""outputs"". One can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two basic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov process with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov processes side by side. In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author showed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category. Here we go further by constructing a symmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms are ways of coarse-graining open Markov processes. We also extend the already known ""black-boxing"" functor from the category of open Markov processes to our double category. Black-boxing sends any open Markov process to the linear relation between input and output data that holds in steady states, including nonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability through the process. To extend black-boxing to a functor between double categories, we need to prove that black-boxing is compatible with coarse-graining.",2017-10-31T06:27:25Z,2018-11-21T23:00:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11343v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11343v4,"math-ph, math.CT, math.MP, math.PR"
Sequential Stochastic Optimization in Separable Learning Environments,"R. Reid Bishop, Chelsea C.

We model this broad class of problems as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). The belief function for the modulation process is control invariant, thus separating the estimation of the modulation process from the control of the state process. We call this specially structured POMDP the separable POMDP, or SEP-POMDP, and show it (i) can serve as a model for a broad class of application areas, e.g., inventory control, finance, healthcare systems, (ii) inherits value function and optimal policy structure from a set of completely observed MDPs, (iii) can serve as a bridge between classical models of sequential decision making under uncertainty having fully specified model artifacts and such models that are not fully specified and require the use of predictive methods from statistics and machine learning, and (iv) allows for specialized approximate solution procedures.",2021-08-21T21:29:04Z,2021-08-21T21:29:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09585v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09585v1,"math.OC, cs.LG, stat.ML"

When used for training an identification model, the adversarial process induces the competition of two discriminative models; one for a primary task such as speaker identification or image recognition, the other one for a subsidiary task such as channel identification or domain identification. In particular, the adversarial process degrades the performance of the subsidiary model by eliminating the subsidiary information in the input which, in assumption, may degrade the performance of the primary model. The conventional adversarial processes maximize the CCE of the subsidiary model to degrade the performance. We have studied a framework for training robust discriminative models by eliminating channel or domain information (subsidiary information) by applying such an adversarial process. However, we found through experiments that using the process of maximizing the CCE does not guarantee the performance degradation of the subsidiary model. In the proposed adversarial process using cosine similarity, on the contrary, the performance of the subsidiary model can be degraded more efficiently by searching feature space orthogonal to the subsidiary model. The experiments on speaker identification and image recognition show that we found features that make the outputs of the subsidiary models independent of the input, and the performances of the primary models are improved.",2019-07-01T04:44:35Z,2019-07-01T04:44:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00542v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00542v1,"cs.LG, eess.AS, eess.IV, stat.ML"
Process Discovery for Structured Program Synthesis,"Dell Zhang, Alexander Kuhnle, Julian Richardson, Murat Sensoy","A core task in process mining is process discovery which aims to learn an accurate process model from event log data. In this paper, we propose to use (block-) structured programs directly as target process models so as to establish connections to the field of program synthesis and facilitate the translation from abstract process models to executable processes, e.g., for robotic process automation. Furthermore, we develop a novel bottom-up agglomerative approach to the discovery of such structured program process models. In comparison with the popular top-down recursive inductive miner, our proposed agglomerative miner enjoys the similar theoretical guarantee to produce sound process models (without deadlocks and other anomalies) while exhibiting some advantages like avoiding silent activities and accommodating duplicate activities. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively applying a few graph rewriting rules to the directly-follows-graph of activities. For real-world (sparse) directly-follows-graphs, the algorithm has quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of distinct activities. To our knowledge, this is the first process discovery algorithm that is made for the purpose of program synthesis. Experiments on the BPI-Challenge 2020 dataset and the Karel programming dataset have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm can outperform the inductive miner not only according to the traditional process discovery metrics but also in terms of the effectiveness in finding out the true underlying structured program from a small number of its execution traces.",2020-08-13T10:33:10Z,2020-08-13T10:33:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05804v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05804v1,"cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SE"
Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Process Mining: A General   Overview and Application of a Novel Local Explanation Approach for Predictive   Process Monitoring,"Nijat Mehdiyev, Peter Fettke","The contemporary process-aware information systems possess the capabilities to record the activities generated during the process execution. To leverage these process specific fine-granular data, process mining has recently emerged as a promising research discipline. As an important branch of process mining, predictive business process management, pursues the objective to generate forward-looking, predictive insights to shape business processes. In this study, we propose a conceptual framework sought to establish and promote understanding of decision-making environment, underlying business processes and nature of the user characteristics for developing explainable business process prediction solutions. Consequently, with regard to the theoretical and practical implications of the framework, this study proposes a novel local post-hoc explanation approach for a deep learning classifier that is expected to facilitate the domain experts in justifying the model decisions. In contrary to alternative popular perturbation-based local explanation approaches, this study defines the local regions from the validation dataset by using the intermediate latent space representations learned by the deep neural networks. To validate the applicability of the proposed explanation method, the real-life process log data delivered by the Volvo IT Belgium's incident management system are used.The adopted deep learning classifier achieves a good performance with the Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.94. The generated local explanations are also visualized and presented with relevant evaluation measures that are expected to increase the users' trust in the black-box-model.",2020-09-04T10:28:56Z,2020-09-12T07:24:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02098v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02098v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"

We discuss existence and path-wise regularity of solutions for the stochastic Volterra equations introduced and we provide a financial application to volatility modeling. We also propose a numerical scheme for simulating the processes. The numerical scheme exhibits a strong convergence rate of 1/2, which is independent of the roughness parameter of the volatility process. This is a significant improvement compared to Euler schemes used in similar models.

Improving Model Chain Approaches for Probabilistic Solar Energy   Forecasting through Post-processing and Machine Learning,"Nina Horat, Sina Klerings, Sebastian Lerch","Weather forecasts from numerical weather prediction models play a central role in solar energy forecasting, where a cascade of physics-based models is used in a model chain approach to convert forecasts of solar irradiance to solar power production, using additional weather variables as auxiliary information. Ensemble weather forecasts aim to quantify uncertainty in the future development of the weather, and can be used to propagate this uncertainty through the model chain to generate probabilistic solar energy predictions. However, ensemble prediction systems are known to exhibit systematic errors, and thus require post-processing to obtain accurate and reliable probabilistic forecasts. The overarching aim of our study is to systematically evaluate different strategies to apply post-processing methods in model chain approaches: Not applying any post-processing at all; post-processing only the irradiance predictions before the conversion; post-processing only the solar power predictions obtained from the model chain; or applying post-processing in both steps. In a case study based on a benchmark dataset for the Jacumba solar plant in the U.S., we develop statistical and machine learning methods for post-processing ensemble predictions of global horizontal irradiance and solar power generation. Further, we propose a neural network-based model for direct solar power forecasting that bypasses the model chain. Our results indicate that post-processing substantially improves the solar power generation forecasts, in particular when post-processing is applied to the power predictions. The machine learning methods for post-processing yield slightly better probabilistic forecasts, and the direct forecasting approach performs comparable to the post-processing strategies.",2024-06-06T18:08:50Z,2024-06-06T18:08:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04424v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04424v1,"stat.AP, cs.LG, physics.ao-ph, stat.ML"
"Causal Inference on Process Graphs, Part II: Causal Structure and Effect   Identification","Nicolas-Domenic Reiter, Jonas Wahl, Andreas Gerhardus, Jakob Runge","A structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) process is a linear causal model for variables that evolve over a discrete set of time points and between which there may be lagged and instantaneous effects. The qualitative causal structure of an SVAR process can be represented by its finite and directed process graph, in which a directed link connects two processes whenever there is a lagged or instantaneous effect between them. At the process graph level, the causal structure of SVAR processes is compactly parameterised in the frequency domain. In this paper, we consider the problem of causal discovery and causal effect estimation from the spectral density, the frequency domain analogue of the auto covariance, of the SVAR process. Causal discovery concerns the recovery of the process graph and causal effect estimation concerns the identification and estimation of causal effects in the frequency domain.   We show that information about the process graph, in terms of $d$- and $t$-separation statements, can be identified by verifying algebraic constraints on the spectral density. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of rational identifiability for frequency causal effects that may be confounded by exogenous latent processes, and show that the recent graphical latent factor half-trek criterion can be used on the process graph to assess whether a given (confounded) effect can be identified by rational operations on the entries of the spectral density.",2024-06-25T09:54:16Z,2024-08-16T08:15:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17422v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17422v2,"math.ST, stat.ME, stat.TH"
Self-Exciting Random Evolutions (SEREs) and their Applications,Anatoliy Swishchuk,"This paper is devoted to the study of a new so-called self-exciting random evolutions (SEREs) and their applications. We introduce a new random process $x(t)$ such that it is based on a superposition of a Markov chain $x_n$ and a Hawkes process $N(t)$; i.e., $x(t) := x_{N(t)}$. We call this process self-walking imbedded semi-Hawkes process (Swish Process or SwishP). Then the self-exciting REs (SEREs) can be constructed in similar way as, e.g., semi-Markov REs, but instead of semi-Markov process $x(t)$ we have SwishP. We give classifications and examples of self-exciting REs (SEREs). Then we consider limit theorems for SEREs such as averaging, diffusion approximation, normal deviations and rates of convergence of SEREs. Applications of SEREs are devoted to the so-called self-exciting traffic/transport process and self-exciting summation on a Markov chain, which are examples of continuous and discrete SERE, respectively. From these processes we can construct many other self-exciting processes, e.g., such as impulse traffic/transport process, self-exciting risk process, etc. We present averaged, diffusion and normal deviated self-exciting processes. Rates of convergence in these cases are presented as well.

In virtue of their analytical tractability, these processes are extensively used in modelling applications. In this paper, we construct broad extensions of these process classes. We show how the known models fit into a classification scheme for diffusion processes for which Laplace transforms for integrals of the diffusion processes and transitional probability densities can be evaluated as integrals of hypergeometric functions against the spectral measure for certain self-adjoint operators.

We prove the global strong existence of these OU-type processes on $ G $ under an integrability assumption on $U$.

The latter is a L\'evy process whose dynamics change by subtracting off a fixed linear drift (of suitable size) whenever the aggregate process is above a pre-specified level. More formally, whenever it exists, a refracted L\'evy process is described by the unique strong solution to the stochastic differential equation \[ \D U_t = - \delta \mathbf{1}_{\{U_t >b\}}\D t + \D X_t \] where $X=\{X_t :t\geq 0\}$ is a L\'evy process with law $\mathbb{P}$ and $b, \delta\in \mathbb{R}$ such that the resulting process $U$ may visit the half line $(b,\infty)$ with positive probability. We consider in particular the case that $X$ is spectrally negative and establish a suite of identities for the case of one and two sided exit problems.

We show that these processes have the peculiar property that they solve fourth order parabolic PDEs, but their exit distribution - at least in the standard Brownian-time process case - solves the usual second order Dirichlet problem. We recover fourth order PDEs in the elliptic setting by encoding the iterative nature of the Brownian-time process, through its exit time, in a standard Brownian motion.

Parameter Estimation: The Proper Way to Use Bayesian Posterior Processes   with Brownian Noise,Asaf Cohen,"This paper studies a problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for a sequence of scaled counting processes whose weak limit is a Brownian motion with an unknown drift. The main result of the paper is that the limit of the posterior distribution processes is, in general, not equal to the posterior distribution process of the mentioned Brownian motion with the unknown drift. Instead, it is equal to the posterior distribution process associated with a Brownian motion with the same unknown drift and a different standard deviation coefficient. The difference between the two standard deviation coefficients can be arbitrarily large. The characterization of the limit of the posterior distribution processes is then applied to a family of stopping time problems. We show that the proper way to find asymptotically optimal solutions to stopping time problems w.r.t.~the scaled counting processes is by looking at the limit of the posterior distribution processes rather than by the naive approach of looking at the limit of the scaled counting processes themselves.

Flowgraph Models and Analysis for Markov Jump Processes,"Muhammad Fikri Budiana, Murwan H. M. A. Siddig","Flowgraph models provide an alternative approach in modeling a multi-state stochastic process. One of the most widely used stochastic processes that have many real-world applications especially in actuarial models is the Markov jump process or continuous- time Markov chain. However, finding waiting time distributions between any two states in a Markov jump process can be very difficult. Flowgraph analysis for Markov jump process comprises of modeling the possible states of the process, the interstates waiting time distribution, and working on the moment generating function domain to obtain the total waiting time distribution in form of density or survival function. This paper gives the theory and computational method of flowgraph analysis, uses it in Markov process problems, and compares the traditional Markov process construction method with the flowgraph method to demonstrate the convenience and practicality of flowgraph analysis.",2016-11-01T19:23:53Z,2016-11-01T19:23:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01362v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01362v1,"stat.AP, math.PR, 60"

For the symmetric Cauchy process and the positive half-line we give a spectral representation of the Yaglom limit. Our approach relies on the scalings of the stable process and the cone, which allow to express the temporal asymptotics of the distribution of the process at infinity by means of the spatial asymptotics of harmonic functions of the process at the vertex; on the representation of the probability of survival of the process in the cone as a Green potential; and on the approximate factorization of the heat kernel of the cone, which secures compactness and yields a limiting (Yaglom) measure by means of Prokhorov's theorem.",2016-12-12T05:35:28Z,2016-12-12T05:35:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03548v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03548v1,"math.PR, math.AP, 31B05, 60J45, 60F05, 60G51"

Runtime Verification for Business Processes Utilizing the Bitcoin   Blockchain,"Christoph Prybila, Stefan Schulte, Christoph Hochreiner, Ingo Weber","The usage of process choreographies and decentralized Business Process Management Systems has been named as an alternative to centralized business process orchestration. In choreographies, control over a process instance is shared between independent parties, and no party has full control or knowledge during process runtime. Nevertheless, it is necessary to monitor and verify process instances during runtime for purposes of documentation, accounting, or compensation.   To achieve business process runtime verification, this work explores the suitability of the Bitcoin blockchain to create a novel solution for choreographies. The resulting approach is realized in a fully-functional software prototype. This software solution is evaluated in a qualitative comparison. Findings show that our blockchain-based approach enables a seamless execution monitoring and verification of choreographies, while at the same time preserving anonymity and independence of the process participants.

Differential Entropy Rate Characterisations of Long Range Dependent   Processes,"Andrew Feutrill, Matthew Roughan","A quantity of interest to characterise continuous-valued stochastic processes is the differential entropy rate. The rate of convergence of many properties of LRD processes is slower than might be expected, based on the intuition for conventional processes, e.g. Markov processes. Is this also true of the entropy rate?   In this paper we consider the properties of the differential entropy rate of stochastic processes that have an autocorrelation function that decays as a power law. We show that power law decaying processes with similar autocorrelation and spectral density functions, Fractional Gaussian Noise and ARFIMA(0,d,0), have different entropic properties, particularly for negatively correlated parameterisations. Then we provide an equivalence between the mutual information between past and future and the differential excess entropy for stationary Gaussian processes, showing the finiteness of this quantity is the boundary between long and short range dependence. Finally, we analyse the convergence of the conditional entropy to the differential entropy rate and show that for short range dependence that the rate of convergence is of the order $O(n^{-1})$, but it is slower for long range dependent processes and depends on the Hurst parameter.",2021-02-10T08:06:36Z,2021-10-30T05:23:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05306v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05306v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, math.PR"
Control of Fork-Join Processing Networks with Multiple Job Types and   Parallel Shared Resources,Erhun Ozkan,"A fork-join processing network is a queueing network in which tasks associated with a job can be processed simultaneously. Fork-join processing networks are prevalent in computer systems, healthcare, manufacturing, project management, justice system, etc. Unlike the conventional queueing networks, fork-join processing networks have synchronization constraints that arise due to the parallel processing of tasks and can cause significant job delays. We study scheduling control in fork-join processing networks with multiple job types and parallel shared resources. Jobs arriving in the system fork into arbitrary number of tasks, then those tasks are processed in parallel, and then they join and leave the network. There are shared resources processing multiple job types. We study the scheduling problem for those shared resources (that is, which type of job to prioritize at any given time) and propose an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy in diffusion scale.",2020-02-04T19:08:18Z,2020-02-04T19:08:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01496v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01496v1,"math.PR, math.OC, 60K25, 90B22, 90B36, 93E20, 60F17"
Anomaly Search with Multiple Plays under Delay and Switching Costs,"Tidhar Lambez, Kobi Cohen","The problem of searching for $L$ anomalous processes among $M$ processes is considered. At each time, the decision maker can observe a subset of $K$ processes (i.e., multiple plays). The measurement drawn when observing a process follows one of two different distributions, depending on whether the process is normal or abnormal. The goal is to design a policy that minimizes the Bayes risk which balances between the sample complexity, detection errors, and the switching cost associated with switching across processes. We develop a policy, dubbed consecutive controlled sensing (CCS), to achieve this goal. On the one hand, by contrast to existing studies on controlled sensing, the CCS policy senses processes consecutively to reduce the switching cost. On the other hand, the policy controls the sensing operation in a closed-loop manner to switch between processes when necessary to guarantee reliable inference. We prove theoretically that CCS is asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the Bayes risk as the detection error approaches zero (i.e., the sample complexity increases). Simulation results demonstrate strong performance of CCS in the finite regime as well.",2021-08-06T12:36:00Z,2021-08-06T12:36:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03082v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03082v1,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"

Conditioning continuous-time Markov processes by guiding,"Marc Corstanje, Frank van der Meulen, Moritz Schauer","A continuous-time Markov process $X$ can be conditioned to be in a given state at a fixed time $T > 0$ using Doob's $h$-transform. This transform requires the typically intractable transition density of $X$. The effect of the $h$-transform can be described as introducing a guiding force on the process. Replacing this force with an approximation defines the wider class of guided processes. For certain approximations the law of a guided process approximates - and is equivalent to - the actual conditional distribution, with tractable likelihood-ratio. The main contribution of this paper is to prove that the principle of a guided process, introduced in Schauer et al. (2017) for stochastic differential equations, can be extended to a more general class of Markov processes. In particular we apply the guiding technique to jump processes in discrete state spaces.

Fundamentals of Gaussian CM Sequences,"Reza Rezaie, X. Rong Li","Markov processes are widely used in modeling random phenomena/problems. However, they may not be adequate in some cases where more general processes are needed. The conditionally Markov (CM) process is a generalization of the Markov process based on conditioning. There are several classes of CM processes (one of them is the class of reciprocal processes), which provide more capability (than Markov) for modeling random phenomena. Reciprocal processes have been used in many different applications (e.g., image processing, intent inference, intelligent systems). In this paper, nonsingular Gaussian (NG) CM sequences are studied, characterized, and their dynamic models are presented. The presented results provide effective tools for studying reciprocal sequences from the CM viewpoint, which is different from that of the literature.

For the root systems $A_{N-1}$ and $B_N$ these Bessel processes are related with $\beta$-Hermite and $\beta$-Laguerre ensembles. Moreover, for the frozen case $k=\infty$, these processes degenerate to deterministic or pure jump processes. We use the generators for Bessel and Dunkl processes of types A and B and derive analogues of Wigner's semicircle and Marchenko-Pastur limit laws for $N\to\infty$ for the empirical distributions of the particles with arbitrary initial empirical distributions by using free convolutions. In particular, for Dunkl processes of type B new non-symmetric semicircle-type limit distributions on $\mathbb R$ appear. Our results imply that the form of the limiting measures is already completely determined by the frozen processes. Moreover, in the frozen cases, our approach leads to a new simple proof of the semicircle and Marchenko-Pastur limit laws for the empirical measures of the zeroes of Hermite and Laguerre polynomials respectively.",2020-09-29T11:17:54Z,2020-09-29T11:17:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13928v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13928v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.CA, math.MP, 60F05, 60F15, 60B20, 60J60, 60K35, 70F10, 82C22"

We develop a large dataset containing over 60k event processes, featuring ultra fine-grained typing on both the action and object type axes with very large ($10^3\sim 10^4$) label vocabularies.

Most probable paths for developed processes,"Erlend Grong, Stefan Sommer","Optimal paths for the classical Onsager-Machlup functional determining most probable paths between points on a manifold are only explicitly identified for specific processes, for example the Riemannian Brownian motion. This leaves out large classes of manifold-valued processes such as processes with parallel transported non-trivial diffusion matrix, processes with rank-deficient generator and sub-Riemannian processes, and push-forwards to quotient spaces. In this paper, we construct a general approach to definition and identification of most probable paths by measuring the Onsager-Machlup functional on the anti-developement of such processes. The construction encompasses large classes of manifold-valued process and results in explicit equation systems for most probable paths. We define and derive these results and apply them to several cases of stochastic processes on Lie groups, homogeneous spaces, and landmark spaces appearing in shape analysis.",2022-11-28T09:24:05Z,2022-11-28T09:24:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15168v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.15168v1,"math.PR, math.DG, math.ST, stat.TH, 62R30, 60D05, 53C17"

Reducing the Prior Mismatch of Stochastic Differential Equations for   Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement,"Bunlong Lay, Simon Welker, Julius Richter, Timo Gerkmann","Recently, score-based generative models have been successfully employed for the task of speech enhancement. A stochastic differential equation is used to model the iterative forward process, where at each step environmental noise and white Gaussian noise are added to the clean speech signal. While in limit the mean of the forward process ends at the noisy mixture, in practice it stops earlier and thus only at an approximation of the noisy mixture. This results in a discrepancy between the terminating distribution of the forward process and the prior used for solving the reverse process at inference. In this paper, we address this discrepancy and propose a forward process based on a Brownian bridge. We show that such a process leads to a reduction of the mismatch compared to previous diffusion processes. More importantly, we show that our approach improves in objective metrics over the baseline process with only half of the iteration steps and having one hyperparameter less to tune.",2023-02-28T16:45:42Z,2023-05-30T13:05:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14748v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14748v2,"eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD"
The neural correlates of logical-mathematical symbol systems processing   resemble that of spatial cognition more than natural language processing,"Yuannan Li, Shan Xu, Jia Liu","The ability to manipulate logical-mathematical symbols (LMS), encompassing tasks such as calculation, reasoning, and programming, is a cognitive skill arguably unique to humans. Considering the relatively recent emergence of this ability in human evolutionary history, it has been suggested that LMS processing may build upon more fundamental cognitive systems, possibly through neuronal recycling. Previous studies have pinpointed two primary candidates, natural language processing and spatial cognition. Existing comparisons between these domains largely relied on task-level comparison, which may be confounded by task idiosyncrasy. The present study instead compared the neural correlates at the domain level with both automated meta-analysis and synthesized maps based on three representative LMS tasks, reasoning, calculation, and mental programming. Our results revealed a more substantial cortical overlap between LMS processing and spatial cognition, in contrast to language processing. Furthermore, in regions activated by both spatial and language processing, the multivariate activation pattern for LMS processing exhibited greater multivariate similarity to spatial cognition than to language processing. A hierarchical clustering analysis further indicated that typical LMS tasks were indistinguishable from spatial cognition tasks at the neural level, suggesting an inherent connection between these two cognitive processes. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that spatial cognition is likely the basis of LMS processing, which may shed light on the limitations of large language models in logical reasoning, particularly those trained exclusively on textual data without explicit emphasis on spatial content.",2024-06-20T14:31:09Z,2024-06-20T14:31:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14358v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14358v1,"q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.CL"
Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in   Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes,"Heshan Aravinda, Yevgeniy Kovchegov, Peter T. Otto, Amites Sarkar","Random coalescent processes and branching processes are two fundamental constructs in the field of stochastic processes, each with a rich history and a wide range of applications. Though developed within distinct contexts, in this note we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the set of equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process using a well known result of branching processes, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process using results derived from the theory of vector multiplicative coalescence. While the correspondence is fairly straightforward, it illuminates a deep connection between these two paradigms which we hope will continue to reveal new insights and potential for cross-disciplinary research.",2024-09-10T23:26:15Z,2025-02-27T02:44:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06910v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06910v2,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 60J80, 60J90, 05C80"
A KAN-based Interpretable Framework for Process-Informed Prediction of   Global Warming Potential,"Jaewook Lee, Xinyang Sun, Ethan Errington, Miao Guo","Accurate prediction of Global Warming Potential (GWP) is essential for assessing the environmental impact of chemical processes and materials. Traditional GWP prediction models rely predominantly on molecular structure, overlooking critical process-related information. In this study, we present an integrative GWP prediction model that combines molecular descriptors (MACCS keys and Mordred descriptors) with process information (process title, description, and location) to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability. Using a deep neural network (DNN) model, we achieved an R-squared of 86% on test data with Mordred descriptors, process location, and description information, representing a 25% improvement over the previous benchmark of 61%; XAI analysis further highlighted the significant role of process title embeddings in enhancing model predictions. To enhance interpretability, we employed a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to derive a symbolic formula for GWP prediction, capturing key molecular and process features and providing a transparent, interpretable alternative to black-box models, enabling users to gain insights into the molecular and process factors influencing GWP. Error analysis showed that the model performs reliably in densely populated data ranges, with increased uncertainty for higher GWP values. This analysis allows users to manage prediction uncertainty effectively, supporting data-driven decision-making in chemical and process design. Our results suggest that integrating both molecular and process-level information in GWP prediction models yields substantial gains in accuracy and interpretability, offering a valuable tool for sustainability assessments. Future work may extend this approach to additional environmental impact categories and refine the model to further enhance its predictive reliability.",2024-11-01T07:48:05Z,2024-11-01T07:48:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00426v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00426v1,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY"
The Boolean Functions Computed by Random Boolean Formulas OR How to Grow   the Right Function,"Alex Brodsky, Nicholas Pippenger","Among their many uses, growth processes (probabilistic amplification), were used for constructing reliable networks from unreliable components, and deriving complexity bounds of various classes of functions. Hence, determining the initial conditions for such processes is an important and challenging problem. In this paper we characterize growth processes by their initial conditions and derive conditions under which results such as Valiant's (1984) hold. First, we completely characterize growth processes that use linear connectives. Second, by extending Savick\'y's (1990) analysis, via ``Restriction Lemmas'', we characterize growth processes that use monotone connectives, and show that our technique is applicable to growth processes that use other connectives as well. Additionally, we obtain explicit bounds on the convergence rates of several growth processes, including the growth process studied by Savick\'y (1990).",2003-02-19T21:57:06Z,2003-02-19T21:57:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0302028v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0302028v1,"cs.DM, cs.CC, F.1.1;F.1.2;G.2.1;G.3"

With this representation we compute covariances and show L^2 and almost sure time and space convergence of the process.

The Theory of Quantum Levy Processes,Uwe Franz,"Various recent results on quantum L\'evy processes are presented. The first part provides an introduction to the theory of L\'evy processes on involutive bialgebras. The notion of independence used for these processes is tensor independence, which generalizes the notion of independence used in classical probability and corresponds to independent observables in quantum physics.   In quantum probability there exist other notions of independence and L\'evy processes can also be defined for the five so-called universal independences. This is the topic of the second part. In particular, it is shown that boolean, monotone, and anti-monotone independence can be reduced to tensor independence.   Finally, in the third part, several classes of quantum L\'evy processes of special interest are considered, e.g., L\'evy processes on real Lie algebras or Brownian motions on braided spaces. Several applications of these processes are also presented.",2004-07-28T14:45:03Z,2004-07-28T14:45:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407488v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0407488v1,"math.PR, math.QA, 16W30; 17B37; 46L53; 60G51; 81R50; 81S25"
On processes which cannot be distinguished by finitary observation,"Yonatan Gutman, Michael Hochman","A function $J$ defined on a family $C$ of stationary processes is finitely observable if there is a sequence of functions $s_n$ such that $s_n(x_1 ... x_n)\to J(X)$ in probability for every process $X=(x_n)\in C$. Recently, Ornstein and Weiss roved the striking result that if $C$ is the class of aperiodic ergodic finite valued processes, then the only finitely observable isomorphism invariant on $C$ is entropy. We sharpen this in several ways. Our main theorem is that if $X \to Y$ is a zero-entropy extension of finite entropy ergodic systems and $C$ is the family of processes arising from $X$ and $Y$, then every finitely observable function on $C$ is constant. This implies Ornstein and Weiss' result, and extends it to many other families of processes, e.g. it shows that there are no nontrivial finitely observable isomorphism invariants for processes arising from Kronecker systems, mild and strong mixing zero entropy systems. It also implies that any finitely observable isomorphism invariant defined on the family of processes arising from irrational rotations must be constant for rotations belonging to a set of full Lebesgue measure.",2006-08-13T07:15:51Z,2006-08-13T07:15:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608310v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0608310v1,"math.DS, math.PR, 37A35, 60G10"

Such transformations have the important property of preserving analytic solvability of the process: the transition probability density for the driftless process can be expressed through the transition probability density of original process.

It turns out that both the generalized data processing theorems and the Boltzmann H-Theorem can be viewed as special cases of a more general principle concerning the monotonicity (in time) of a certain generalized information measure applied to a Markov process. This gives rise to a new look at the generalized data processing theorem, which suggests to exploit certain degrees of freedom that may lead to better bounds, for a given choice of the convex function that defines the generalized mutual information.",2010-07-16T18:45:23Z,2010-07-16T18:45:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2827v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.2827v1,"cs.IT, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.IT"

We show that the autocovariance and the spectral density of the discretized process are asymptotically rescaled by a factor smaller than one, and we compute exactly this scaling factor. Consequently, we find that the discretized process is also long memory with the same Hurst exponent as the original process. We consider the properties of two estimators of the Hurst exponent, namely the local Whittle (LW) estimator and the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). By using analytical considerations and numerical simulations we show that, in presence of round-off error, both estimators are severely negatively biased in finite samples. Under regularity conditions we prove that the LW estimator applied to discretized processes is consistent and asymptotically normal.

As a consequence of these two results, we derive a formula for the continuum statistics of the Airy$_1$ process, analogous to that obtained in [CQR11] for the Airy$_2$ process.",2012-01-23T13:23:42Z,2012-04-13T20:55:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4709v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4709v3,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP"
Generalized Gaussian Bridges,"Tommi Sottinen, Adil Yazigi","A generalized bridge is the law of a stochastic process that is conditioned on N linear functionals of its path. We consider two types of representations of such bridges: orthogonal and canonical.   The orthogonal representation is constructed from the entire path of the underlying process. Thus, future knowledge of the path is needed. The orthogonal representation is provided for any continuous Gaussian process.   In the canonical representation the filtrations and the linear spaces generated by the bridge process and the underlying process coincide. Thus, no future information of the underlying process is needed. Also, in the semimartingale case the canonical bridge representation is related to the enlargement of filtration and semimartingale decompositions. The canonical representation is provided for the so-called prediction-invertible Gaussian processes. All martingales are trivially prediction-invertible. A typical non-semimartingale example of a prediction-invertible Gaussian process is the fractional Brownian motion.   We apply the canonical bridges to insider trading.",2012-05-15T15:04:02Z,2013-11-22T10:46:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3405v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.3405v2,"math.PR, q-fin.CP, 60G15, 60G22, 91G80"
Parametric estimation of the driving L√©vy process of multivariate   CARMA processes from discrete observations,"Peter J. Brockwell, Eckhard Schlemm","We consider the parametric estimation of the driving L\'evy process of a multivariate continuous-time autoregressive moving average (MCARMA) process, which is observed on the discrete time grid $(0,h,2h,...)$. Beginning with a new state space representation, we develop a method to recover the driving L\'evy process exactly from a continuous record of the observed MCARMA process. We use tools from numerical analysis and the theory of infinitely divisible distributions to extend this result to allow for the approximate recovery of unit increments of the driving L\'evy process from discrete-time observations of the MCARMA process. We show that, if the sampling interval $h=h_N$ is chosen dependent on $N$, the length of the observation horizon, such that $N h_N$ converges to zero as $N$ tends to infinity, then any suitable generalized method of moments estimator based on this reconstructed sample of unit increments has the same asymptotic distribution as the one based on the true increments, and is, in particular, asymptotically normally distributed.",2012-09-05T12:49:26Z,2012-09-05T12:49:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0952v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.0952v1,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 62F10, 60G51, 60F05 (Primary) 60E07, 60G10 (Secondary)"
Ergodicity and scaling limit of a constrained multivariate Hawkes   process,"Ban Zheng, Fran√ßois Roueff, Fr√©d√©ric Abergel","We introduce a multivariate Hawkes process with constraints on its conditional density. It is a multivariate point process with conditional intensity similar to that of a multivariate Hawkes process but certain events are forbidden with respect to boundary conditions on a multidimensional constraint variable, whose evolution is driven by the point process. We study this process in the special case where the fertility function is exponential so that the process is entirely described by an underlying Markov chain, which includes the constraint variable. Some conditions on the parameters are established to ensure the ergodicity of the chain. Moreover, scaling limits are derived for the integrated point process.

Information or material enters a given process as a stream of inputs, and the process converts it to a stream of outputs. Output streams can then be supplied to other processes in an organized manner, and the resulting system of interconnected processes can itself be considered a macro process. To model the inherent structure in this kind of system, we define an operad $\mathcal{W}$ of black boxes and directed wiring diagrams, and we define a $\mathcal{W}$-algebra $\mathcal{P}$ of processes (which we call propagators, after Radul and Sussman).

In the context of such markets and for power utility functions, it is proved that the stochastic control problem consisting of optimizing the expected utility of the terminal wealth, has a classical solution (i.e. $C^{1,2}$).

Motivated by conjugate priors based on exponential family representations of likelihoods, we introduce a notion of exponential families for CRMs, which we call exponential CRMs. This construction allows us to specify automatic Bayesian nonparametric conjugate priors for exponential CRM likelihoods. We demonstrate that our exponential CRMs allow particularly straightforward recipes for size-biased and marginal representations of Bayesian nonparametric models. Along the way, we prove that the gamma process is a conjugate prior for the Poisson likelihood process and the beta prime process is a conjugate prior for a process we call the odds Bernoulli process.

The points of such a process are random displacements of Poisson point processes defined on the lines of a Poisson line process. Parameter estimation based on moment methods or Bayesian inference for this model is discussed when the underlying Poisson line process and the cluster memberships are treated as hidden processes. To illustrate the methodologies, we analyze a two and a three-dimensional point pattern data set.

The corresponding perimeter process is identified as a biased random walk, in terms of which the admissibility criterion has a very simple interpretation. The finite random planar maps under consideration were recently proved to possess a well-defined local limit known as the infinite Boltzmann planar map (IBPM). Inspired by recent work of Curien and Le Gall, we show that the peeling process on the IBPM can be obtained from the peeling process of finite random maps by conditioning the perimeter process to stay positive. The simplicity of the resulting description of the peeling process allows us to obtain the scaling limit of the associated perimeter and volume process for arbitrary regular critical weight sequences.",2015-06-04T13:45:12Z,2016-02-03T15:13:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01590v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01590v3,"math-ph, gr-qc, math.CO, math.MP, math.PR"

The process is order one and is more parsimonious than alternative stochastic modeling approaches in the literature.

This paper studies the problem of recovering the causal structure in network of multivariate linear Hawkes processes. In such processes, the occurrence of an event in one process affects the probability of occurrence of new events in some other processes. Thus, a natural notion of causality exists between such processes captured by the support of the excitation matrix. We show that the resulting causal influence network is equivalent to the Directed Information graph (DIG) of the processes, which encodes the causal factorization of the joint distribution of the processes. Furthermore, we present an algorithm for learning the support of excitation matrix (or equivalently the DIG).

In this paper, the volatility is modeled as a stationary process with long-range correlation properties in order to capture such a situation, and we consider European option pricing. This means that the volatility process is neither a Markov process nor a martingale. However, by exploiting the fact that the price process is still a semimartingale and accordingly using the martingale method, we can obtain an analytical expression for the option price in the regime where the volatility process is fast mean-reverting. The volatility process is modeled as a smooth and bounded function of a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

In many systems, for instance hardware/software systems, we have to do with both parallel processes that may best be considered to be interleaved in an arbitrary way and parallel processes that may best be considered to be interleaved according to some interleaving strategy.

ADOL - Markovian approximation of rough lognormal model,"Peter Carr, Andrey Itkin","In this paper we apply Markovian approximation of the fractional Brownian motion (BM), known as the Dobric-Ojeda (DO) process, to the fractional stochastic volatility model where the instantaneous variance is modelled by a lognormal process with drift and fractional diffusion. Since the DO process is a semi-martingale, it can be represented as an \Ito diffusion. It turns out that in this framework the process for the spot price $S_t$ is a geometric BM with stochastic instantaneous volatility $\sigma_t$, the process for $\sigma_t$ is also a geometric BM with stochastic speed of mean reversion and time-dependent colatility of volatility, and the supplementary process $\calV_t$ is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with time-dependent coefficients, and is also a function of the Hurst exponent. We also introduce an adjusted DO process which provides a uniformly good approximation of the fractional BM for all Hurst exponents $H \in [0,1]$ but requires a complex measure. Finally, the characteristic function (CF) of $\log S_t$ in our model can be found in closed form by using asymptotic expansion. Therefore, pricing options and variance swaps (by using a forward CF) can be done via FFT, which is much easier than in rough volatility models.",2019-04-19T15:50:16Z,2019-04-19T15:50:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09240v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09240v1,"q-fin.MF, q-fin.CP, q-fin.PR"

Numerical Gaussian processes have recently been developed to simulate spatiotemporal models. The contribution of this paper is to embed numerical Gaussian processes into the recursive Kalman filter equations. This embedding enables us to do Kalman filtering on infinite-dimensional systems using Gaussian processes. This is possible because i) we are obtaining a linear model from numerical Gaussian processes, and ii) the states of this model are by definition Gaussian distributed random variables. Convenient properties of the numerical GPKF are that no spatial discretization of the model is necessary, and manual setting up of the Kalman filter, that is fine-tuning the process and measurement noise levels by hand is not required, as they are learned online from the data stream.

Large deviations for the empirical measure of the zig-zag process,"Joris Bierkens, Pierre Nyquist, Mikola C.

The process can be designed to have an arbitrary Gibbs type marginal probability density for its position coordinate, which makes it suitable for Monte Carlo simulation of continuous probability distributions. An important question in assessing the efficiency of this method is how fast the empirical measure converges to the stationary distribution of the process. In this paper we provide a partial answer to this question by characterizing the large deviations of the empirical measure from the stationary distribution. Based on the Feng-Kurtz approach, we develop an abstract framework aimed at encompassing piecewise deterministic Markov processes in position-velocity space. We derive explicit conditions for the zig-zag process to allow the Donsker-Varadhan variational formulation of the rate function, both for a compact setting (the torus) and one-dimensional Euclidean space. Finally we derive an explicit expression for the Donsker-Varadhan functional for the case of a compact state space and use this form of the rate function to address a key question concerning the optimal choice of the switching rate of the zig-zag process.",2019-12-13T18:04:27Z,2019-12-22T11:04:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06635v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06635v2,"math.PR, stat.CO, 60F10, 60J25"
Compound Dirichlet Processes,"Arrigo Coen, Beatriz God√≠nez-Chaparro","The compound Poisson process and the Dirichlet process are the pillar structures of Renewal theory and Bayesian nonparametric theory, respectively. Both processes have many useful extensions to fulfill the practitioners needs to model the particularities of data structures. Accordingly, in this contribution, we joined their primal ideas to construct the compound Dirichlet process and the compound Dirichlet process mixture. As a consequence, these new processes had a fruitful structure to model the time occurrence among events, with also a flexible structure on the arrival variables. These models have a direct Bayesian interpretation of their posterior estimators and are easy to implement.

Privacy Amplification by Mixing and Diffusion Mechanisms,"Borja Balle, Gilles Barthe, Marco Gaboardi, Joseph Geumlek","A fundamental result in differential privacy states that the privacy guarantees of a mechanism are preserved by any post-processing of its output. In this paper we investigate under what conditions stochastic post-processing can amplify the privacy of a mechanism. By interpreting post-processing as the application of a Markov operator, we first give a series of amplification results in terms of uniform mixing properties of the Markov process defined by said operator. Next we provide amplification bounds in terms of coupling arguments which can be applied in cases where uniform mixing is not available. Finally, we introduce a new family of mechanisms based on diffusion processes which are closed under post-processing, and analyze their privacy via a novel heat flow argument. On the applied side, we generalize the analysis of ""privacy amplification by iteration"" in Noisy SGD and show it admits an exponential improvement in the strongly convex case, and study a mechanism based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process which contains the Gaussian mechanism with optimal post-processing on bounded inputs as a special case.",2019-05-29T08:07:57Z,2019-10-27T14:20:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12264v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12264v2,"cs.LG, cs.CR, math.PR, stat.ML"
Segmentasi Citra Menggunakan Metode Watershed Transform Berdasarkan   Image Enhancement Dalam Mendeteksi Embrio Telur,Shoffan Saifullah,"Image processing can be applied in the detection of egg embryos. The egg embryos detection is processed using a segmentation process. The segmentation divides the image according to the area that is divided. This process requires improvement of the image that is processed to obtain optimal results. This study will analyze the detection of egg embryos based on image processing with image enhancement and the concept of segmentation using the watershed method. Image enhancement in preprocessing in image improvement uses a combination of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Histogram Equalization (HE) methods. The grayscale egg image is corrected using the CLAHE method, and the results are reprocessed using HE. The image improvement results show that the CLAHE-HE combination method gives a clear picture of the object area of the egg image that has an embryo. The segmentation process using image conversion to black and white image and watershed segmentation can clearly show the object of a chicken egg that has an embryo. The results of segmentation can divide the area of the egg having embryos in a real and accurate way with a percentage \approx 98\%.",2021-02-08T14:03:51Z,2021-02-08T14:03:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04202v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04202v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, I.4.6"
Factorization and discrete-time representation of multivariate CARMA   processes,"Vicky Fasen-Hartmann, Markus Scholz","In this paper we show that stationary and non-stationary multivariate continuous-time ARMA (MCARMA) processes have the representation as a sum of multivariate complex-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes under some mild assumptions. The proof benefits from properties of rational matrix polynomials. A conclusion is an alternative description of the autocovariance function of a stationary MCARMA process. Moreover, that representation is used to show that the discrete-time sampled MCARMA(p,q) process is a weak VARMA(p,p-1) process if second moments exist. That result complements the weak VARMA(p,p-1) representation derived in Chambers and Thornton (2012). In particular, it relates the right solvents of the autoregressive polynomial of the MCARMA process to the right solvents of the autoregressive polynomial of the VARMA process; in the one-dimensional case the right solvents are the zeros of the autoregressive polynomial. Finally, a factorization of the sample autocovariance function of the noise sequence is presented which is useful for statistical inference.",2021-02-23T13:10:17Z,2021-02-23T13:10:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11681v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11681v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62M10, 62M86, 60G10, G.3"

Event-based Failure Prediction in Distributed Business Processes,"Michael Borkowski, Walid Fdhila, Matteo Nardelli, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Stefan Schulte","Traditionally, research in Business Process Management has put a strong focus on centralized and intra-organizational processes. However, today's business processes are increasingly distributed, deviating from a centralized layout, and therefore calling for novel methodologies of detecting and responding to unforeseen events, such as errors occurring during process runtime. In this article, we demonstrate how to employ event-based failure prediction in business processes. This approach allows to make use of the best of both traditional Business Process Management Systems and event-based systems. Our approach employs machine learning techniques and considers various types of events.

Modeling Spatial Overdispersion with the Generalized Waring Process,"Mimoza Zografi, Evdokia Xekalaki","Modeling spatial overdispersion requires point processes models with finite dimensional distributions that are overdisperse relative to the Poisson. Fitting such models usually heavily relies on the properties of stationarity, ergodicity, and orderliness. And, though processes based on negative binomial finite dimensional distributions have been widely considered, they typically fail to simultaneously satisfy the three required properties for fitting. Indeed, it has been conjectured by Diggle and Milne that no negative binomial model can satisfy all three properties. In light of this, we change perspective, and construct a new process based on a different overdisperse count model, the Generalized Waring Distribution. While comparably tractable and flexible to negative binomial processes, the Generalized Waring process is shown to possess all required properties, and additionally span the negative binomial and Poisson processes as limiting cases. In this sense, the GW process provides an approximate resolution to the conundrum highlighted by Diggle and Milne.",2017-12-22T22:00:27Z,2017-12-22T22:00:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08669v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08669v1,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.ME, stat.TH"
Dynamic maintenance policy for systems with repairable components   subject to mutually dependent competing failure processes,"Nooshin Yousefi, David W. Coit, Zhu Xiaoyan","In this paper, a repairable multi-component system is studied where all the components can be repaired individually within the system. The whole system is inspected at inspection intervals and the failed components are detected and replaced with a new one, while the other components continue functioning. Replacing components individually within the system makes their initial age to be different at each inspection time. Different initial age of all the components have affect on the system reliability and probability of failure and consequently the optimal inspection time, which is for the whole system not individual components. A dynamic maintenance policy is proposed to find the next inspection time based on the initial age of all the components. Two competing failure processes of degradation and a shock process are considered for each component. In our paper, there is a mutual dependency between the degradation process and shock process. Each incoming shock adds additional abrupt damages on the cumulative degradation path of all the components, and the shock arrival process is affected by the system degradation process. A realistic numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed reliability and maintenance model.",2020-02-02T16:29:31Z,2020-02-02T16:29:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00427v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00427v1,"eess.SP, math.OC, stat.AP"

We derive exact conditional and marginal probability distributions for the sampled process under a stationarity assumption, and an exact expression for the likelihood of any sequence of genealogies it generates.

How recurrent networks implement contextual processing in sentiment   analysis,"Niru Maheswaranathan, David Sussillo","Neural networks have a remarkable capacity for contextual processing--using recent or nearby inputs to modify processing of current input. For example, in natural language, contextual processing is necessary to correctly interpret negation (e.g. phrases such as ""not bad""). However, our ability to understand how networks process context is limited. Here, we propose general methods for reverse engineering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to identify and elucidate contextual processing. We apply these methods to understand RNNs trained on sentiment classification. This analysis reveals inputs that induce contextual effects, quantifies the strength and timescale of these effects, and identifies sets of these inputs with similar properties. Additionally, we analyze contextual effects related to differential processing of the beginning and end of documents. Using the insights learned from the RNNs we improve baseline Bag-of-Words models with simple extensions that incorporate contextual modification, recovering greater than 90% of the RNN's performance increase over the baseline. This work yields a new understanding of how RNNs process contextual information, and provides tools that should provide similar insight more broadly.",2020-04-17T00:58:30Z,2020-04-17T00:58:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08013v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08013v1,"cs.CL, cs.LG, stat.ML"

Crucially, we show that one can sample exactly increments of this process, at any time scale; this allows the implementation of likelihood-free Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for (asymptotically) exact posterior inference.

Besides parameter tuning, there is no interaction between the user and the algorithm. Interactive process discovery allows the user to exploit domain knowledge and to guide the discovery process. Previously, an incremental discovery approach has been introduced where a model, considered to be under construction, gets incrementally extended by user-selected process behavior. This paper introduces a novel approach that additionally allows the user to freeze model parts within the model under construction. Frozen sub-models are not altered by the incremental approach when new behavior is added to the model. The user can thus steer the discovery algorithm. Our experiments show that freezing sub-models can lead to higher quality models.",2021-07-31T11:02:19Z,2021-07-31T11:02:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00215v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00215v1,"cs.LG, cs.DB, cs.HC"

The hyperlogarithmic growth of maximal repetition has been experimentally observed for texts in natural language, whereas the power-law growth of topological entropy implies a vanishing Shannon entropy rate and thus probably does not hold for natural language. In this paper, we provide a constructive example of regular Hilberg processes, which we call random hierarchical association (RHA) processes. Our construction does not apply the standard cutting and stacking method. For the constructed RHA processes, we demonstrate that the expected length of any uniquely decodable code is orders of magnitude larger than the Shannon block entropy of the ergodic component of the RHA process.

On Generation of Time-based Label Refinements,"Niek Tax, Emin Alasgarov, Natalia Sidorova, Reinder Haakma","Process mining is a research field focused on the analysis of event data with the aim of extracting insights in processes. Applying process mining techniques on data from smart home environments has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions. Finding the right event labels to enable application of process mining techniques is however far from trivial, as simply using the triggering sensor as the label for sensor events results in uninformative models that allow for too much behavior (overgeneralizing). Refinements of sensor level event labels suggested by domain experts have shown to enable discovery of more precise and insightful process models. However, there exist no automated approach to generate refinements of event labels in the context of process mining. In this paper we propose a framework for automated generation of label refinements based on the time attribute of events. We show on a case study with real life smart home event data that behaviorally more specific, and therefore more insightful, process models can be found by using automatically generated refined labels in process discovery.",2016-09-12T10:25:29Z,2016-09-12T10:25:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03333v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03333v1,"stat.ME, cs.AI, stat.ML"

Methods of Adaptive Signal Processing on Graphs Using Vertex-Time   Autoregressive Models,"Thiernithi Variddhisai, Danilo Mandic","The concept of a random process has been recently extended to graph signals, whereby random graph processes are a class of multivariate stochastic processes whose coefficients are matrices with a \textit{graph-topological} structure. The system identification problem of a random graph process therefore revolves around determining its underlying topology, or mathematically, the graph shift operators (GSOs) i.e. an adjacency matrix or a Laplacian matrix. In the same work that introduced random graph processes, a \textit{batch} optimization method to solve for the GSO was also proposed for the random graph process based on a \textit{causal} vertex-time autoregressive model. To this end, the online version of this optimization problem was proposed via the framework of adaptive filtering. The modified stochastic gradient projection method was employed on the regularized least squares objective to create the filter. The recursion is divided into 3 regularized sub-problems to address issues like multi-convexity, sparsity, commutativity and bias. A discussion on convergence analysis is also included.

Fast ultrasonic imaging using end-to-end deep learning,"Georgios Pilikos, Lars Horchens, Kees Joost Batenburg, Tristan van Leeuwen, Felix Lucka","Ultrasonic imaging algorithms used in many clinical and industrial applications consist of three steps: A data pre-processing, an image formation and an image post-processing step. For efficiency, image formation often relies on an approximation of the underlying wave physics. A prominent example is the Delay-And-Sum (DAS) algorithm used in reflectivity-based ultrasonic imaging. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being used for the data pre-processing and the image post-processing steps separately. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that integrates all three steps to enable end-to-end training. We examine turning the DAS image formation method into a network layer that connects data pre-processing layers with image post-processing layers that perform segmentation.

For a L\'evy process with absolutely continuous marginals, this reduces to understanding the asymptotics of the differential entropy of its marginals at small times, for which we obtain a new local central limit theorem.

In this paper, we present an intelligent data-driven pipeline composed of a set of processing elements to move customers' data from one system to another, transforming the data into the contextualized data and knowledge along the way. The goal is to present a novel intelligent customer segmentation process which automates the feature engineering, i.e., the process of using (banking) domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques, in the banking domain. We adopt a typical scenario for analyzing customer transaction records, to highlight how the presented approach can significantly improve the quality of risk-based customer segmentation in the absence of feature engineering.As result, our proposed method is able to achieve accuracy of 91% compared to classical approaches in terms of detecting, identifying and classifying transaction to the right classification.",2020-09-29T11:22:04Z,2020-09-29T11:22:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13929v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13929v1,"cs.CY, cs.IR, cs.LG"
Bias and Variance of Post-processing in Differential Privacy,"Keyu Zhu, Pascal Van Hentenryck, Ferdinando Fioretto","Post-processing immunity is a fundamental property of differential privacy: it enables the application of arbitrary data-independent transformations to the results of differentially private outputs without affecting their privacy guarantees. When query outputs must satisfy domain constraints, post-processing can be used to project the privacy-preserving outputs onto the feasible region. Moreover, when the feasible region is convex, a widely adopted class of post-processing steps is also guaranteed to improve accuracy. Post-processing has been applied successfully in many applications including census data-release, energy systems, and mobility. However, its effects on the noise distribution is poorly understood: It is often argued that post-processing may introduce bias and increase variance. This paper takes a first step towards understanding the properties of post-processing. It considers the release of census data and examines, both theoretically and empirically, the behavior of a widely adopted class of post-processing functions.",2020-10-09T02:12:54Z,2020-10-09T02:12:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04327v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04327v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR"
Shedding Light on Blind Spots: Developing a Reference Architecture to   Leverage Video Data for Process Mining,"Wolfgang Kratsch, Fabian Koenig, Maximilian Roeglinger","Process mining is one of the most active research streams in business process management. In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for analyzing structured process data. Yet, in many cases, it is only the digitized parts of processes that are directly captured from process-aware information systems, and manual activities often result in blind spots. While the use of video cameras to observe these activities could help to fill this gap, a standardized approach to extracting event logs from unstructured video data remains lacking. Here, we propose a reference architecture to bridge the gap between computer vision and process mining. Various evaluation activities (i.e., competing artifact analysis, prototyping, and real-world application) ensured that the proposed reference architecture allows flexible, use-case-driven, and context-specific instantiations.

Could we exploit data of already developed processes to make predictions for a novel process, we could significantly reduce the number of experiments needed. Processes for different products exhibit differences in behaviour, typically only a subset behave similar. Therefore, effective learning on multiple product spanning process data requires a sensible representation of the product identity. We propose to represent the product identity (a categorical feature) by embedding vectors that serve as input to a Gaussian Process regression model. We demonstrate how the embedding vectors can be learned from process data and show that they capture an interpretable notion of product similarity. The improvement in performance is compared to traditional one-hot encoding on a simulated cross product learning task. All in all, the proposed method could render possible significant reductions in wet-lab experiments.",2020-11-27T17:38:15Z,2020-11-27T17:38:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13863v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13863v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.LG, stat.ML"
Information-constrained optimization: can adaptive processing of   gradients help?,"Jayadev Acharya, Cl√©ment L. Canonne, Prathamesh Mayekar, Himanshu Tyagi","We revisit first-order optimization under local information constraints such as local privacy, gradient quantization, and computational constraints limiting access to a few coordinates of the gradient. In this setting, the optimization algorithm is not allowed to directly access the complete output of the gradient oracle, but only gets limited information about it subject to the local information constraints.   We study the role of adaptivity in processing the gradient output to obtain this limited information from it.We consider optimization for both convex and strongly convex functions and obtain tight or nearly tight lower bounds for the convergence rate, when adaptive gradient processing is allowed. Prior work was restricted to convex functions and allowed only nonadaptive processing of gradients. For both of these function classes and for the three information constraints mentioned above, our lower bound implies that adaptive processing of gradients cannot outperform nonadaptive processing in most regimes of interest. We complement these results by exhibiting a natural optimization problem under information constraints for which adaptive processing of gradient strictly outperforms nonadaptive processing.",2021-04-02T10:45:52Z,2021-04-02T10:45:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00979v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00979v1,"math.OC, cs.DS, cs.IT, math.IT"
Leader Election in Arbitrarily Connected Networks with Process Crashes   and Weak Channel Reliability,"Carlos L√≥pez, Sergio Rajsbaum, Michel Raynal, Karla Vargas","A channel from a process p to a process q satisfies the ADD property if there are constants K and D, unknown to the processes, such that in any sequence of K consecutive messages sent by p to q, at least one of them is delivered to q at most D time units after it has been sent. This paper studies implementations of an eventual leader, namely, an {\Omega} failure detector, in an arbitrarily connected network of eventual ADD channels, where processes may fail by crashing. It first presents an algorithm that assumes that processes initially know n, the total number of processes, sending messages of size O( log n). Then, it presents a second algorithm that does not assume the processes know n. Eventually the size of the messages sent by this algorithm is also O( log n).

On the nature of time in time-dependent expansionary processes,Laurence Lacey,"For an expansionary process, the size of the expansion space will increase. If the expansionary process is time-dependent, time (t) will increase as a function of the increase in the size of the expansion space. A statistical information entropy methodology was used to investigate the properties of time-dependent expansionary processes both in theory and through examples. The primary objective of this paper was to investigate whether there is a universal measure of time (T) and how it relates to process related time (t), that is specific to any given time-dependent expansionary process. It was found that for such time-dependent processes, time (t) can be rescaled to time (T) such that, T and the information entropy (H(T)) of the expansionary process are the same, and directly related to the increase in the size of the expansion space.",2021-06-02T09:39:37Z,2021-06-02T09:39:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02453v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math.PR, stat.ME"

We obtain an exact, full characterization of the time-dependent joint transform of the multivariate population process and its underlying intensity process in terms of a fixed-point representation and corresponding convergence results. We also derive the asymptotic tail behavior of the population process and its underlying intensity process in the setting of heavy-tailed intensity jumps.

Specifically, we provide an interval-valued confidence process $C^\alpha(t)$ over continuous time $t$ for the cumulative arrival rate $\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(s) \mathrm{d}s$ with a continuous-time anytime-valid coverage guarantee $\mathbb{P}[\Lambda(t) \in C^\alpha(t) \, \forall t >0] \geq 1-\alpha$. We extend our results to compare two independent arrival processes by constructing multivariate confidence processes and a closed-form $e$-process for testing the equality of rates with a time-uniform Type-I error guarantee at a nominal $\alpha$. We characterize the asymptotic growth rate of the proposed $e$-process under the alternative and show that it has power 1 when the average rates of the two Poisson process differ in the limit.

The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) have yielded additional opportunities for researchers in a wide variety of fields. LLMs are efficient at transforming content from one format to another, leveraging the body of knowledge they have been trained with in the process. In this article, we discuss opportunities of using LLMs for analyzing programming process data. To complement our discussion, we outline a case study where we have leveraged LLMs for automatically summarizing the programming process and for creating formative feedback on the programming process.

Asymptotically Optimal Search for a Change Point Anomaly under a   Composite Hypothesis Model,"Liad Lea Didi, Tomer Gafni, Kobi Cohen","We address the problem of searching for a change point in an anomalous process among a finite set of M processes. Specifically, we address a composite hypothesis model in which each process generates measurements following a common distribution with an unknown parameter (vector). This parameter belongs to either a normal or abnormal space depending on the current state of the process. Before the change point, all processes, including the anomalous one, are in a normal state; after the change point, the anomalous process transitions to an abnormal state. Our goal is to design a sequential search strategy that minimizes the Bayes risk by balancing sample complexity and detection accuracy. We propose a deterministic search algorithm with the following notable properties. First, we analytically demonstrate that when the distributions of both normal and abnormal processes are unknown, the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in minimizing the Bayes risk as the error probability approaches zero. In the second setting, where the parameter under the null hypothesis is known, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality with improved detection time based on the true normal state.

High-Dimensional Markov-switching Ordinary Differential Processes,"Katherine Tsai, Mladen Kolar, Sanmi Koyejo","We investigate the parameter recovery of Markov-switching ordinary differential processes from discrete observations, where the differential equations are nonlinear additive models. This framework has been widely applied in biological systems, control systems, and other domains; however, limited research has been conducted on reconstructing the generating processes from observations. In contrast, many physical systems, such as human brains, cannot be directly experimented upon and rely on observations to infer the underlying systems. To address this gap, this manuscript presents a comprehensive study of the model, encompassing algorithm design, optimization guarantees, and quantification of statistical errors. Specifically, we develop a two-stage algorithm that first recovers the continuous sample path from discrete samples and then estimates the parameters of the processes. We provide novel theoretical insights into the statistical error and linear convergence guarantee when the processes are $\beta$-mixing. Our analysis is based on the truncation of the latent posterior processes and demonstrates that the truncated processes approximate the true processes under mixing conditions.

Decentralized Multi-Antenna Architectures with Unitary Constraints,"Juan Vidal Alegr√≠a, Ove Edfors","The increase in the number of base station (BS) antennas calls for efficient solutions to deal with the increased interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity of traditional centralized approaches. Decentralized approaches are thus gaining momentum, since they achieve important reductions in data/processing volume by preprocessing the received signals before forwarding them to a central node. The WAX framework offers a general description of decentralized architectures with arbitrary interplay between interconnection bandwidth and decentralized processing complexity, but the applicability of this framework has only been studied assuming unrestricted baseband processing. We consider an adaptation of the WAX framework where the decentralized processing has unitary restriction, which allows for energy-efficient implementations based on reconfigurable impedance networks at the cost of some performance loss. Moreover, we propose an effective method to minimize the performance gap with respect to centralized processing. The previous method gives a first step towards characterizing the information-lossless trade-off between interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity in decentralized architectures with unitary constraints.",2025-01-10T15:57:23Z,2025-01-10T15:57:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06067v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06067v1,"eess.SP, cs.IT, math.IT"

The main result of this article establishes sufficient conditions for the window and profile cut-off phenomenon, which are flexible enough to cover the renormalized (non-Markovian) Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process driven by fractional Brownian motion and a large class of Gaussian and non-Gaussian, homogeneous and non-homogeneous drivers with (possible) finite second moments.

Provable Quantum Algorithm Advantage for Gaussian Process Quadrature,"Cristian A.

Gaussian process quadratures are numerical integration methods where Gaussian processes are used as functional priors for the integrands to capture the uncertainty arising from the sparse function evaluations. Quantum computers have emerged as potential replacements for classical computers, offering exponential reductions in the computational complexity of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we combine Gaussian process quadratures and quantum computing by proposing a quantum low-rank Gaussian process quadrature method based on a Hilbert space approximation of the Gaussian process kernel and enhancing the quadrature using a quantum circuit. The method combines the quantum phase estimation algorithm with the quantum principal component analysis technique to extract information up to a desired rank. Then, Hadamard and SWAP tests are implemented to find the expected value and variance that determines the quadrature. We use numerical simulations of a quantum computer to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Information Symmetries in Irreversible Processes,"Christopher J. Ellison, John R. Mahoney, Ryan G. James, James P. Crutchfield, Joerg Reichardt","We study dynamical reversibility in stationary stochastic processes from an information theoretic perspective. Extending earlier work on the reversibility of Markov chains, we focus on finitary processes with arbitrarily long conditional correlations. In particular, we examine stationary processes represented or generated by edge-emitting, finite-state hidden Markov models. Surprisingly, we find pervasive temporal asymmetries in the statistics of such stationary processes with the consequence that the computational resources necessary to generate a process in the forward and reverse temporal directions are generally not the same. In fact, an exhaustive survey indicates that most stationary processes are irreversible. We study the ensuing relations between model topology in different representations, the process's statistical properties, and its reversibility in detail. A process's temporal asymmetry is efficiently captured using two canonical unifilar representations of the generating model, the forward-time and reverse-time epsilon-machines. We analyze example irreversible processes whose epsilon-machine presentations change size under time reversal, including one which has a finite number of recurrent causal states in one direction, but an infinite number in the opposite. From the forward-time and reverse-time epsilon-machines, we are able to construct a symmetrized, but nonunifilar, generator of a process---the bidirectional machine. Using the bidirectional machine, we show how to directly calculate a process's fundamental information properties, many of which are otherwise only poorly approximated via process samples. The tools we introduce and the insights we offer provide a better understanding of the many facets of reversibility and irreversibility in stochastic processes.",2011-07-12T00:09:54Z,2011-07-12T00:09:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2168v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2168v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.IT, math.IT, math.ST, nlin.CD, stat.TH"
The Mixture of Markov Jump Processes: Monte Carlo Method and the EM   Estimation,"H. Frydman, B. A. Surya","This paper discusses tractable development and statistical estimation of a continuous time stochastic process with a finite state space having non-Markov property. The process is formed by a finite mixture of right-continuous Markov jump processes moving at different speeds on the same finite state space, whereas the speed regimes are assumed to be unobservable. The mixture was first proposed by Frydman (J. Am. Stat. Assoc., 100, 1046-1053, 2005) in 2005 and recently generalized in Surya (Stoch. Syst. 8, 29-44, 2018), in which distributional properties and explicit identities of the process are given in its full generality. The contribution of this paper is two fold. First, we present Monte Carlo method for constructing the process and show distributional equivalence between the simulated process and the actual process. Secondly, we perform statistical inference on the distribution parameters of the process. Under complete observation of the sample paths, maximum likelihood estimates are given in explicit form in terms of sufficient statistics of the process. Estimation under incomplete observation is performed using the EM algorithm. The estimation results completely characterize the process in terms of the initial probability of starting the process in any phase of the state space, intensity matrices of the underlying Markov jump processes, and the switching probability matrix of the process. Some numerical examples are given to test the performance of the developed method. The proposed estimation generalizes the existing statistical inferences for the Markov model by Albert (Ann. Math. Statist., 38, p.727-753., 1961), the mover-stayer model by Frydman (J. Am. Stat. Assoc.79, 632-638., 1984) and the Markov mixture model by Frydman (J. Am. Stat.

Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods for Structure-Guided Processing Path   Optimization,"Johannes Dornheim, Lukas Morand, Samuel Zeitvogel, Tarek Iraki, Norbert Link, Dirk Helm","A major goal of materials design is to find material structures with desired properties and in a second step to find a processing path to reach one of these structures. In this paper, we propose and investigate a deep reinforcement learning approach for the optimization of processing paths. The goal is to find optimal processing paths in the material structure space that lead to target-structures, which have been identified beforehand to result in desired material properties. There exists a target set containing one or multiple different structures. Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a start structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths to one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the algorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best reachable target structure and the optimal path to it. The proposed methods belong to the family of model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They are guided by structure representations as features of the process state and by a reward signal, which is formulated based on a distance function in the structure space. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms learn through trial and error while interacting with the process. Thereby, they are not restricted to information from a priori sampled processing data and are able to adapt to the specific process. The optimization itself is model-free and does not require any prior knowledge about the process itself. We instantiate and evaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a generic metal forming process. We show the ability of both methods to find processing paths leading close to target structures and the ability of the extended method to identify target-structures that can be reached effectively and efficiently and to focus on these targets for sample efficient processing path optimization.",2020-09-21T09:20:24Z,2021-07-07T23:00:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09706v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09706v4,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.ML, I.2.8; J.6"

In this paper, it is shown, in the context of a Markovian model of parasitic infection, that coincidence can be achieved with asymptotically high probability until o(N^{2/3}) infections have occurred, where N denotes the total number of hosts.",2007-10-19T13:20:08Z,2007-10-19T13:20:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3697v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.3697v1,"math.PR, q-bio.PE, 92D30, 60J85"

James,"Suppose that P_{\theta}(g) is a linear functional of a Dirichlet process with shape \theta H, where \theta >0 is the total mass and H is a fixed probability measure. This paper describes how one can use the well-known Bayesian prior to posterior analysis of the Dirichlet process, and a posterior calculus for Gamma processes to ascertain properties of linear functionals of Dirichlet processes. In particular, in conjunction with a Gamma identity, we show easily that a generalized Cauchy-Stieltjes transform of a linear functional of a Dirichlet process is equivalent to the Laplace functional of a class of, what we define as, Beta-Gamma processes. This represents a generalization of an identity due to Cifarelli and Regazzini, which is also known as the Markov-Krein identity for mean functionals of Dirichlet processes. These results also provide new explanations and interpretations of results in the literature. The identities are analogues to quite useful identities for Beta and Gamma random variables. We give a result which can be used to ascertain specifications on H such that the Dirichlet functional is Beta distributed. This avoids the need for an inversion formula for these cases and points to the special nature of the Dirichlet process, and indeed the functional Beta-Gamma calculus developed in this paper.",2005-05-27T11:48:39Z,2005-05-27T11:48:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0505606v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505606v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62G05 (Primary) 62F15 (Secondary)"
A Maximum Entropy solution of the Covariance Extension Problem for   Reciprocal Processes,"Francesca Carli, Augusto Ferrante, Michele Pavon, Giorgio Picci","Stationary reciprocal processes defined on a finite interval of the integer line can be seen as a special class of Markov random fields restricted to one dimension. Non stationary reciprocal processes have been extensively studied in the past especially by Jamison, Krener, Levy and co-workers. The specialization of the non-stationary theory to the stationary case, however, does not seem to have been pursued in sufficient depth in the literature. Stationary reciprocal processes (and reciprocal stochastic models) are potentially useful for describing signals which naturally live in a finite region of the time (or space) line. Estimation or identification of these models starting from observed data seems still to be an open problem which can lead to many interesting applications in signal and image processing. In this paper, we discuss a class of reciprocal processes which is the acausal analog of auto-regressive (AR) processes, familiar in control and signal processing. We show that maximum likelihood identification of these processes leads to a covariance extension problem for block-circulant covariance matrices. This generalizes the famous covariance band extension problem for stationary processes on the integer line. As in the usual stationary setting on the integer line, the covariance extension problem turns out to be a basic conceptual and practical step in solving the identification problem. We show that the maximum entropy principle leads to a complete solution of the problem.",2011-01-25T15:24:16Z,2011-01-25T15:24:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.4849v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.4849v1,"math.OC, cs.IT, cs.SY, math.IT, math.PR"
High-frequency sampling and kernel estimation for continuous-time moving   average processes,"Peter Brockwell, Vincenzo Ferrazzano, Claudia Kl√ºppelberg","Interest in continuous-time processes has increased rapidly in recent years, largely because of high-frequency data available in many applications. We develop a method for estimating the kernel function $g$ of a second-order stationary L\'evy-driven continuous-time moving average (CMA) process $Y$ based on observations of the discrete-time process $Y^\Delta$ obtained by sampling $Y$ at $\Delta, 2\Delta,...,n\Delta$ for small $\Delta$. We approximate $g$ by $g^\Delta$ based on the Wold representation and prove its pointwise convergence to $g$ as $\Delta\rightarrow 0$ for $\CARMA(p,q)$ processes. Two non-parametric estimators of $g^\Delta$, based on the innovations algorithm and the Durbin-Levinson algorithm, are proposed to estimate $g$. For a Gaussian CARMA process we give conditions on the sample size $n$ and the grid-spacing $\Delta(n)$ under which the innovations estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as $n\rightarrow\infty$. The estimators can be calculated from sampled observations of {\it any} CMA process and simulations suggest that they perform well even outside the class of CARMA processes. We illustrate their performance for simulated data and apply them to the Brookhaven turbulent wind speed data. Finally we extend results of \citet{bfk:2011:1} for sampled CARMA processes to a much wider class of CMA processes.",2011-07-22T09:57:45Z,2013-01-19T12:38:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4468v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4468v4,"math.ST, stat.TH, Primary: 60G12, 62M10, 62M15, Secondary: 60G10, 60G25, 62M20"
Double Aztec Diamonds and the Tacnode Process,"Mark Adler, Kurt Johansson, Pierre van Moerbeke","Discrete and continuous non-intersecting random processes have given rise to critical ""infinite dimensional diffusions"", like the Airy process, the Pearcey process and variations thereof. It has been known that domino tilings of very large Aztec diamonds lead macroscopically to a disordered region within an inscribed ellipse (arctic circle in the homogeneous case), and a regular brick-like region outside the ellipse. The fluctuations near the ellipse, appropriately magnified and away from the boundary of the Aztec diamond, form an Airy process, run with time tangential to the boundary.   This paper investigates the domino tiling of two overlapping Aztec diamonds; this situation also leads to non-intersecting random walks and an induced point process; this process is shown to be determinantal. In the large size limit, when the overlap is such that the two arctic ellipses for the single Aztec diamonds merely touch, a new critical process will appear near the point of osculation (tacnode), which is run with a time in the direction of the common tangent to the ellipses: this is the ""tacnode process"". It is also shown here that this tacnode process is universal: it coincides with the one found in the context of two groups of non-intersecting random walks or also Brownian motions, meeting momentarily.",2011-12-23T08:50:14Z,2011-12-23T08:50:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5532v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5532v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.CO, math.MP"
Signal processing with Levy information,"Dorje C. Brody, Lane P. Hughston, Xun Yang","Levy processes, which have stationary independent increments, are ideal for modelling the various types of noise that can arise in communication channels. If a Levy process admits exponential moments, then there exists a parametric family of measure changes called Esscher transformations. If the parameter is replaced with an independent random variable, the true value of which represents a ""message"", then under the transformed measure the original Levy process takes on the character of an ""information process"". In this paper we develop a theory of such Levy information processes. The underlying Levy process, which we call the fiducial process, represents the ""noise type"". Each such noise type is capable of carrying a message of a certain specification. A number of examples are worked out in detail, including information processes of the Brownian, Poisson, gamma, variance gamma, negative binomial, inverse Gaussian, and normal inverse Gaussian type. Although in general there is no additive decomposition of information into signal and noise, one is led nevertheless for each noise type to a well-defined scheme for signal detection and enhancement relevant to a variety of practical situations.",2012-07-17T15:27:46Z,2012-09-20T15:33:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4028v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4028v2,"math.PR, cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT, math.OC, q-fin.GN"
Adaptable processes,"Mario Bravetti, Cinzia Di Giusto, Jorge A Perez, Gianluigi Zavattaro","We propose the concept of adaptable processes as a way of overcoming the limitations that process calculi have for describing patterns of dynamic process evolution. Such patterns rely on direct ways of controlling the behavior and location of running processes, and so they are at the heart of the adaptation capabilities present in many modern concurrent systems. Adaptable processes have a location and are sensible to actions of dynamic update at runtime; this allows to express a wide range of evolvability patterns for concurrent processes. We introduce a core calculus of adaptable processes and propose two verification problems for them: bounded and eventual adaptation. While the former ensures that the number of consecutive erroneous states that can be traversed during a computation is bound by some given number k, the latter ensures that if the system enters into a state with errors then a state without errors will be eventually reached. We study the (un)decidability of these two problems in several variants of the calculus, which result from considering dynamic and static topologies of adaptable processes as well as different evolvability patterns. Rather than a specification language, our calculus intends to be a basis for investigating the fundamental properties of evolvable processes and for developing richer languages with evolvability capabilities.",2012-10-23T21:00:05Z,2012-11-16T01:35:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6379v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6379v2,"cs.LO, cs.PL, D.2.4; F.3.1; F.3.2; F.4.3"
Rigidity hierarchy in random point fields: random polynomials and   determinantal processes,"Subhro Ghosh, Manjunath Krishnapur","In certain point processes, the configuration of points outside a bounded domain determines, with probability 1, certain statistical features of the points within the domain. This notion, called rigidity, was introduced in a work of Ghosh and Peres. In this paper, rigidity and the related notion of tolerance are examined systematically and point processes with rigidity of various degrees are introduced. Natural classes of point processes such as determinantal point processes, zero sets of Gaussian entire functions and perturbed lattices are examined from the point of view of rigidity, and general conditions are provided for them to exhibit specified nature of spatially rigid behaviour. In particular, we examine the rigidity of determinantal point processes in terms of their kernel, and demonstrate that a necessary condition for determinantal processes to exhibit rigidity is that their kernel must be a projection. We introduce a one parameter family of point processes which exhibit arbitrarily high levels of rigidity (depending on the choice of parameter value), answering a natural question on point processes with higher levels of rigidity (beyond the known examples of rigidity of local mass and center of mass). Our one parameter family is also related to a natural extension of the standard planar Gaussian analytic function process and their zero sets.",2015-10-29T18:37:20Z,2022-03-10T11:02:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08814v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08814v2,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP"
Analytical computation of frequency distributions of path-dependent   processes by means of a non-multinomial maximum entropy approach,"Rudolf Hanel, Bernat Corominas-Murtra, Stefan Thurner","Path-dependent stochastic processes are often non-ergodic and observables can no longer be computed within the ensemble picture. The resulting mathematical difficulties pose severe limits to the analytical understanding of path-dependent processes. Their statistics is typically non-multinomial in the sense that the multiplicities of the occurrence of states is not a multinomial factor. The maximum entropy principle is tightly related to multinomial processes, non-interacting systems, and to the ensemble picture; It loses its meaning for path-dependent processes. Here we show that an equivalent to the ensemble picture exists for path-dependent processes, such that the non-multinomial statistics of the underlying dynamical process, by construction, is captured correctly in a functional that plays the role of a relative entropy. We demonstrate this for self-reinforcing P\'olya urn processes, which explicitly generalise multinomial statistics. We demonstrate the adequacy of this constructive approach towards non-multinomial pendants of entropy by computing frequency and rank distributions of P\'olya urn processes. We show how microscopic update rules of a path-dependent process allow us to explicitly construct a non-multinomial entropy functional, that, when maximized, predicts the time-dependent distribution function.",2015-11-02T08:59:23Z,2016-12-23T15:12:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00414v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00414v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.IT, math.IT"
Testing for Serial Dependence in Binomial Time Series I: Parameter   Driven Models,"W. T. M. Dunsmuir, J. Y. He","Binomial time series in which the logit of the probability of success is modelled as a linear function of observed regressors and a stationary latent Gaussian process are considered. Score tests are developed to first test for the existence of a latent process and, subsequent to that, evidence of serial dependence in that latent process. The test for the existence of a latent process is important because, if one is present, standard logistic regression methods will produce inconsistent estimates of the regression parameters. However the score test is non-standard and any serial dependence in the latent process will require consideration of nuisance parameters which cannot be estimated under the null hypothesis of no latent process. The paper describes how a supremum-type test can be applied. If a latent process is detected, consistent estimation of its variance and the regression parameters can be done using marginal estimation which is easily implemented using generalised linear mixed model methods. The test for serial dependence in a latent process does not involve nuisance parameters and is based on the covariances between residuals centered at functions of the latent process conditional on the observations. This requires numerical integration in order to compute the test statistic. Relevant asymptotic results are derived and confirmed using simulation evidence. Application to binary and binomial time series is made. For binary series in particular, a complication is that the variance of the latent process, even if present, can be estimated to be zero with a high probability.",2016-06-03T07:02:09Z,2016-06-03T07:02:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00983v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00983v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62F99"
Spatial modeling and analysis of cellular networks using the Ginibre   point process: A tutorial,"Naoto Miyoshi, Tomoyuki Shirai","Spatial stochastic models have been much used for performance analysis of wireless communication networks. This is due to the fact that the performance of wireless networks depends on the spatial configuration of wireless nodes and the irregularity of node locations in a real wireless network can be captured by a spatial point process. Most works on such spatial stochastic models of wireless networks have adopted homogeneous Poisson point processes as the models of wireless node locations. While this adoption makes the models analytically tractable, it assumes that the wireless nodes are located independently of each other and their spatial correlation is ignored. Recently, the authors have proposed to adopt the Ginibre point process---one of the determinantal point processes---as the deployment models of base stations (BSs) in cellular networks. The determinantal point processes constitute a class of repulsive point processes and have been attracting attention due to their mathematically interesting properties and efficient simulation methods. In this tutorial, we provide a brief guide to the Ginibre point process and its variant, $\alpha$-Ginibre point process, as the models of BS deployments in cellular networks and show some existing results on the performance analysis of cellular network models with $\alpha$-Ginibre deployed BSs. The authors hope the readers to use such point processes as a tool for analyzing various problems arising in future cellular networks.",2016-06-09T05:40:00Z,2016-06-09T05:40:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02828v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02828v1,"cs.IT, math.IT, math.PR, 60G55, C.2.1"
The Zig-Zag Process and Super-Efficient Sampling for Bayesian Analysis   of Big Data,"Joris Bierkens, Paul Fearnhead, Gareth Roberts","Standard MCMC methods can scale poorly to big data settings due to the need to evaluate the likelihood at each iteration. There have been a number of approximate MCMC algorithms that use sub-sampling ideas to reduce this computational burden, but with the drawback that these algorithms no longer target the true posterior distribution. We introduce a new family of Monte Carlo methods based upon a multi-dimensional version of the Zig-Zag process of (Bierkens, Roberts, 2017), a continuous time piecewise deterministic Markov process. While traditional MCMC methods are reversible by construction (a property which is known to inhibit rapid convergence) the Zig-Zag process offers a flexible non-reversible alternative which we observe to often have favourable convergence properties. We show how the Zig-Zag process can be simulated without discretisation error, and give conditions for the process to be ergodic. Most importantly, we introduce a sub-sampling version of the Zig-Zag process that is an example of an {\em exact approximate scheme}, i.e. the resulting approximate process still has the posterior as its stationary distribution. Furthermore, if we use a control-variate idea to reduce the variance of our unbiased estimator, then the Zig-Zag process can be super-efficient: after an initial pre-processing step, essentially independent samples from the posterior distribution are obtained at a computational cost which does not depend on the size of the data.",2016-07-11T22:30:50Z,2018-04-23T13:30:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03188v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.03188v2,"stat.CO, math.PR, 65C60, 65C05, 62F15, 60J25"

The pfaffian Schur process, previously studied by several authors, is recovered when just one of the boundary partitions is left free. We compute the correlation functions of the process in all generality via the free fermion formalism, which we extend with the thorough treatment of ""free boundary states"". For the case of one free boundary, our approach yields a new proof that the process is pfaffian. For the case of two free boundaries, we find that the process is not pfaffian, but a closely related process is. We also study three different applications of the Schur process with one free boundary: fluctuations of symmetrized last passage percolation models, limit shapes and processes for symmetric plane partitions, and for plane overpartitions.",2017-04-19T16:38:20Z,2018-11-21T13:30:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05809v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05809v3,"math.PR, math-ph, math.CO, math.MP"
Decay Replay Mining to Predict Next Process Events,"Julian Theis, Houshang Darabi","In complex processes, various events can happen in different sequences. The prediction of the next event given an a-priori process state is of importance in such processes. Recent methods have proposed deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks, developed on raw event logs, to predict the next event from a process state. However, such deep learning models by themselves lack a clear representation of the process states. At the same time, recent methods have neglected the time feature of event instances. In this paper, we take advantage of Petri nets as a powerful tool in modeling complex process behaviors considering time as an elemental variable. We propose an approach which starts from a Petri net process model constructed by a process mining algorithm. We enhance the Petri net model with time decay functions to create continuous process state samples. Finally, we use these samples in combination with discrete token movement counters and Petri net markings to train a deep learning model that predicts the next event. We demonstrate significant performance improvements and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on nine real-world benchmark event logs.",2019-03-12T14:53:10Z,2019-08-26T20:54:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05084v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05084v3,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"

We compare such theories and provide explicit formulas to pass from one formulation to the other; as a bi-product we give a simple proof of the link between reversibility of the dynamics and gradient flow structure of the associated Fokker-Planck equation. We do this both for linear Markov processes and for a class of nonlinear Markov process as well. We then characterize the structure of the Large deviation functional of generalised-reversible processes; this is a class of non-reversible processes of large relevance in applications.

A Compositional Framework for Markov Processes,"John C. Baez, Brendan Fong, Blake S. Pollard","We define the concept of an ""open"" Markov process, or more precisely, continuous-time Markov chain, which is one where probability can flow in or out of certain states called ""inputs"" and ""outputs"". One can build up a Markov process from smaller open pieces. This process is formalized by making open Markov processes into the morphisms of a dagger compact category. We show that the behavior of a detailed balanced open Markov process is determined by a principle of minimum dissipation, closely related to Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production. Using this fact, we set up a functor mapping open detailed balanced Markov processes to open circuits made of linear resistors. We also describe how to ""black box"" an open Markov process, obtaining the linear relation between input and output data that holds in any steady state, including nonequilibrium steady states with a nonzero flow of probability through the system. We prove that black boxing gives a symmetric monoidal dagger functor sending open detailed balanced Markov processes to Lagrangian relations between symplectic vector spaces. This allows us to compute the steady state behavior of an open detailed balanced Markov process from the behaviors of smaller pieces from which it is built. We relate this black box functor to a previously constructed black box functor for circuits.",2015-08-26T11:31:07Z,2016-03-22T00:52:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06448v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06448v4,"math-ph, math.CT, math.MP, math.PR"
"Fractional Brownian motion, the Matern process, and stochastic modeling   of turbulent dispersion","J. M. Lilly, A. M. Sykulski, J. J Early, S. C. Olhede","Stochastic process exhibiting power-law slopes in the frequency domain are frequently well modeled by fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In particular, the spectral slope at high frequencies is associated with the degree of small-scale roughness or fractal dimension. However, a broad class of real-world signals have a high-frequency slope, like fBm, but a plateau in the vicinity of zero frequency. This low-frequency plateau, it is shown, implies that the temporal integral of the process exhibits diffusive behavior, dispersing from its initial location at a constant rate. Such processes are not well modeled by fBm, which has a singularity at zero frequency corresponding to an unbounded rate of dispersion. A more appropriate stochastic model is a much lesser-known random process called the Matern process, which is shown herein to be a damped version of fractional Brownian motion. This article first provides a thorough introduction to fractional Brownian motion, then examines the details of the Matern process and its relationship to fBm. An algorithm for the simulation of the Matern process in O(N log N) operations is given. Unlike fBm, the Matern process is found to provide an excellent match to modeling velocities from particle trajectories in an application to two-dimensional fluid turbulence.",2016-05-05T18:35:36Z,2017-09-02T04:34:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01684v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01684v3,"stat.ME, physics.ao-ph, physics.flu-dyn"
Characterising information-theoretic storage and transfer in continuous   time processes,"Richard E. Spinney, Joseph T. Lizier","The characterisation of information processing is an important task in complex systems science. Information dynamics is a quantitative methodology for modelling the intrinsic information processing conducted by a process represented as a time series, but to date has only been formulated in discrete time. Building on previous work which demonstrated how to formulate transfer entropy in continuous time, we give a total account of information processing in this setting, incorporating information storage. We find that a convergent rate of predictive capacity, comprised of the transfer entropy and active information storage, does not exist, arising through divergent rates of active information storage. We identify that active information storage can be decomposed into two separate quantities that characterise predictive capacity stored in a process: active memory utilisation and instantaneous predictive capacity. The latter involves prediction related to path regularity and so solely inherits the divergent properties of the active information storage, whilst the former permits definitions of pathwise and rate quantities. We formulate measures of memory utilisation for jump and neural spiking processes and illustrate measures of information processing in synthetic neural spiking models and coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. The application to synthetic neural spiking models demonstrates that active memory utilisation for point processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at spikes) interrupting a continuously varying contribution (relating to waiting times between spikes), complementing the behaviour previously demonstrated for transfer entropy in these processes.",2018-04-09T23:08:52Z,2018-04-09T23:08:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03269v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03269v1,"cs.IT, math.IT, physics.data-an, q-bio.NC"

Hence, this work proposes a new process framework, Human-in-the-learning-loop (HILL) Design Cycles - a design process that integrates the structural elements of agile and design thinking process, and controls the training of a machine learning model by the human in the loop. The HILL Design Cycles process replaces the qualitative user testing by a quantitative psychometric measurement instrument for design perception. The generated user feedback serves to train a machine learning model and to instruct the subsequent design cycle along four design dimensions (novelty, energy, simplicity, tool).

Hilbert valued fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average   processes with long memory operators,"Amaury Durand, Fran√ßois Roueff","Fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (FIARMA) processes have been widely and successfully used to model and predict univariate time series exhibiting long range dependence. Vector and functional extensions of these processes have also been considered more recently. Here we study these processes by relying on a spectral domain approach in the case where the processes are valued in a separable Hilbert space H0. In this framework, the usual univariate long memory parameter d is replaced by a long memory operator D acting on H0, leading to a class of H0-valued FIARMA(D, p, q) processes, where p and q are the degrees of the AR and MA polynomials. When D is a normal operator, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the D-fractional integration of an H0-valued ARMA(p, q) process to be well defined. Then, we derive the best predictor for a class of causal FIARMA processes and study how this best predictor can be consistently estimated from a finite sample of the process. To this end, we provide a general result on quadratic functionals of the periodogram, which incidentally yields a result of independent interest. Namely, for any ergodic stationary process valued in H0 with finite second moment, the empirical autocovariance operator converges, in trace-norm, to the true autocovariance operator almost surely at each lag.",2020-10-09T07:10:54Z,2022-10-06T07:48:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04399v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04399v3,"math.FA, math.ST, stat.TH"

Bias-correction and Test for Mark-point Dependence with Replicated   Marked Point Processes,"Ganggang Xu, Jingfei Zhang, Yehua Li, Yongtao Guan","Mark-point dependence plays a critical role in research problems that can be fitted into the general framework of marked point processes. In this work, we focus on adjusting for mark-point dependence when estimating the mean and covariance functions of the mark process, given independent replicates of the marked point process. We assume that the mark process is a Gaussian process and the point process is a log-Gaussian Cox process, where the mark-point dependence is generated through the dependence between two latent Gaussian processes. Under this framework, naive local linear estimators ignoring the mark-point dependence can be severely biased. We show that this bias can be corrected using a local linear estimator of the cross-covariance function and establish uniform convergence rates of the bias-corrected estimators. Furthermore, we propose a test statistic based on local linear estimators for mark-point independence, which is shown to converge to an asymptotic normal distribution in a parametric $\sqrt{n}$-convergence rate. Model diagnostics tools are developed for key model assumptions and a robust functional permutation test is proposed for a more general class of mark-point processes.

Gibbs Phenomenon Suppression in PDE-Based Statistical Spatio-Temporal   Models,"Guanzhou Wei, Xiao Liu, Russell Barton","A class of physics-informed spatio-temporal models has recently been proposed for modeling spatio-temporal processes governed by advection-diffusion equations. The central idea is to approximate the process by a truncated Fourier series and let the governing physics determine the dynamics of the spectral coefficients. However, because many spatio-temporal processes in real applications are non-periodic with boundary discontinuities, the well-known Gibbs phenomenon and ripple artifact almost always exist in the outputs generated by such models due to truncation of the Fourier series. Hence, the key contribution of this paper is to propose a physics-informed spatio-temporal modeling approach that significantly suppresses the Gibbs phenomenon when modeling spatio-temporal advection-diffusion processes. The proposed approach starts with a data flipping procedure for the process respectively along the horizontal and vertical directions (as if we were unfolding a piece of paper that has been folded twice along the two directions). Because the flipped process becomes spatially periodic and has a complete waveform without any boundary discontinuities, the Gibbs phenomenon disappears even if the Fourier series is truncated. Then, for the flipped process and given the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) that governs the process, this paper extends an existing PDE-based spatio-temporal model by obtaining the new temporal dynamics of the spectral coefficients, while maintaining the physical interpretation of the flipped process. Numerical investigations based on a real dataset have been performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. It is found that the proposed approach effectively suppresses the Gibbs Phenomenon and significantly reduces the ripple artifact in modeling spatio-temporal advection-diffusion processes.

The bi-orthogonality relation is imposed between the right and the left eigenvector processes, which allows for their scale transformations with an invariant eigenvalue process. The eigenvector-overlap process is a Hermitian matrix-valued process, each element of which is given by a product of an overlap of right eigenvectors and that of left eigenvectors. We derive a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for the coupled system of the eigenvalue process and the eigenvector-overlap process and prove the scale-transformation invariance of the obtained SDE system. The Fuglede--Kadison (FK) determinant associated with the present matrix-valued process is regularized by introducing an auxiliary complex variable. This variable is necessary to give the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for the time-dependent random field defined by the regularized FK determinant and for its squared and logarithmic variations. Time-dependent point process of eigenvalues and its variation weighted by the diagonal elements of the eigenvector-overlap process are related to the derivatives of the logarithmic regularized FK-determinant random-field. We also discuss the PDEs obtained by averaging the SPDEs.",2023-06-01T02:39:19Z,2023-10-02T07:22:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00300v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00300v3,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP, 60B20, 60H10, 60H15, 60G55"
Mean-Biased Processes for Balanced Allocations,"Dimitrios Los, Thomas Sauerwald, John Sylvester","We introduce a new class of balanced allocation processes which bias towards underloaded bins (those with load below the mean load) either by skewing the probability by which a bin is chosen for an allocation (probability bias), or alternatively, by adding more balls to an underloaded bin (weight bias). A prototypical process satisfying the probability bias condition is Mean-Thinning: At each round, we sample one bin and if it is underloaded, we allocate one ball; otherwise, we allocate one ball to a second bin sample. Versions of this process have been in use since at least 1986. An example of a process, introduced by us, which satisfies the weight bias condition is Twinning: At each round, we only sample one bin. If the bin is underloaded, then we allocate two balls; otherwise, we allocate only one ball.   Our main result is that for any process with a probability or weight bias, with high probability the gap between maximum and minimum load is logarithmic in the number of bins. This result holds for any number of allocated balls (heavily loaded case), covers many natural processes that relax the Two-Choice process, and we also prove it is tight for many such processes, including Mean-Thinning and Twinning.   Our analysis employs a delicate interplay between linear, quadratic and exponential potential functions. It also hinges on a phenomenon we call ""mean quantile stabilization"", which holds in greater generality than our framework and may be of independent interest.",2023-08-09T17:29:05Z,2024-01-10T22:27:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05087v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05087v2,"math.PR, cs.DM, cs.DS, math.CO, 68W20, 68W27, 68W40, 60C05, G.3; G.2.m; F.2.2"
Review of Image Processing Methods in Solar Photospheric Data Analyzes,"Mohsen Javaherian, Zahra Eskandari","With the exponential growth in data volume, especially in recent decades, the demand for data processing has surged across all scientific fields. Within astronomical datasets, the combination of solar space missions and ground-based telescopes has yielded high spatial and temporal resolutions for observing the Sun, thus fueling an increase in the utilization of automatic image processing approaches. Image processing methodologies play a pivotal role in analyzing solar data, a critical component in comprehending the Sun's behavior and its influence on Earth. This paper provides an overview of the utilization of diverse processing techniques applied to images captured from the solar photosphere. The introduction of our manuscript furnishes a description of the solar photosphere along with its primary characteristics. Subsequently, we endeavor to outline the significance of preprocessing photospheric images, a crucial prerequisite before engaging in any form of analysis. The subsequent section delves into an examination of numerous reputable sources that have employed image processing methodologies in their research pertaining to the Sun's surface. This section also encompasses discussions concerning recent advancements in image processing techniques for solar data analysis and their potential implications for future solar research. The final section deliberates on post-processing procedures as supplementary steps that are essential for deriving meaningful results from raw data. Effectively, this paper imparts vital information, offering concise explanations regarding the Sun's surface, the application of image processing techniques to various types of photospheric images, indispensable image preprocessing stages, and post-processing procedures aimed at transforming raw data into coherent and comprehensive insights.",2023-09-30T13:56:02Z,2023-09-30T13:56:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00380v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00380v1,"astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR"
DiffuseRAW: End-to-End Generative RAW Image Processing for Low-Light   Images,Rishit Dagli,"Imaging under extremely low-light conditions presents a significant challenge and is an ill-posed problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused by minimal photon capture. Previously, diffusion models have been used for multiple kinds of generative tasks and image-to-image tasks, however, these models work as a post-processing step. These diffusion models are trained on processed images and learn on processed images. However, such approaches are often not well-suited for extremely low-light tasks. Unlike the task of low-light image enhancement or image-to-image enhancement, we tackle the task of learning the entire image-processing pipeline, from the RAW image to a processed image. For this task, a traditional image processing pipeline often consists of multiple specialized parts that are overly reliant on the downstream tasks. Unlike these, we develop a new generative ISP that relies on fine-tuning latent diffusion models on RAW images and generating processed long-exposure images which allows for the apt use of the priors from large text-to-image generation models. We evaluate our approach on popular end-to-end low-light datasets for which we see promising results and set a new SoTA on the See-in-Dark (SID) dataset. Furthermore, with this work, we hope to pave the way for more generative and diffusion-based image processing and other problems on RAW data.",2023-12-13T03:39:05Z,2023-12-13T03:39:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18575v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18575v1,"eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG"

However, prevailing methods struggle with intricate scenarios and causal relationships, hindering adaptability and interpretability in varied environments. To address the above problems, we introduce LeapAD, a novel paradigm for autonomous driving inspired by the human cognitive process. Specifically, LeapAD emulates human attention by selecting critical objects relevant to driving decisions, simplifying environmental interpretation, and mitigating decision-making complexities. Additionally, LeapAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module, which consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) for thorough analysis and reasoning, along with a Heuristic Process (System-I) for swift and empirical processing. The Analytic Process leverages its logical reasoning to accumulate linguistic driving experience, which is then transferred to the Heuristic Process by supervised fine-tuning. Through reflection mechanisms and a growing memory bank, LeapAD continuously improves itself from past mistakes in a closed-loop environment. Closed-loop testing in CARLA shows that LeapAD outperforms all methods relying solely on camera input, requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less labeled data. Experiments also demonstrate that as the memory bank expands, the Heuristic Process with only 1.8B parameters can inherit the knowledge from a GPT-4 powered Analytic Process and achieve continuous performance improvement.

Three Decades of Formal Methods in Business Process Compliance: A   Systematic Literature Review,"Hugo A. L√≥pez, Thomas T. Hildebrandt","Digitalization efforts often face a key challenge: business processes must not only be efficient in achieving their goals but also adhere to legal regulations. Business process compliance refers to aligning processes with these regulations. Numerous frameworks have been developed to address this, with the earliest dating back to 1981. This study focuses on rigorous frameworks using formal methods to verify or ensure compliance. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on process compliance frameworks based on formal models. Our goal was to assess the current state of research on process model compliance and identify gaps and opportunities for future work. Starting with 5018 candidate studies from 1981 to the establishment of GDPR, we selected 46 primary studies. These frameworks were categorized by their phases, the languages used for processes and compliance, and their reasoning techniques. We also examined their practical applicability, the case studies they were tested on, the types of users involved, and the skills needed for compliance. Also, we assessed the maturity of each framework. Our findings reveal strong consensus around verification techniques as central to process compliance, though there is less agreement on the earlier and later phases of compliance. Model checking is the dominant technique, but the compliance and process languages have evolved. Most frameworks are still conceptual with prototype implementations, often failing to account for compliance professionals like legal experts or law changes. In conclusion, there is a need for comprehensive empirical studies to better understand the anatomy and maturity of regulatory compliance frameworks, and for robust evaluation methods to benchmark these frameworks. This review offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in process compliance.",2024-10-13T21:19:57Z,2024-10-13T21:19:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10906v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10906v1,"cs.SE, 68N30, D.2.4; D.2.1; H.4"
L√©vy graphical models,"Sebastian Engelke, Jevgenijs Ivanovs, Jakob D. Th√∏stesen","Conditional independence and graphical models are crucial concepts for sparsity and statistical modeling in higher dimensions. For L\'evy processes, a widely applied class of stochastic processes, these notions have not been studied. By the L\'evy-It\^o decomposition, a multivariate L\'evy process can be decomposed into the sum of a Brownian motion part and an independent jump process. We show that conditional independence statements between the marginal processes can be studied separately for these two parts. While the Brownian part is well-understood, we derive a novel characterization of conditional independence between the sample paths of the jump process in terms of the L\'evy measure. We define L\'evy graphical models as L\'evy processes that satisfy undirected or directed Markov properties. We prove that the graph structure is invariant under changes of the univariate marginal processes. L\'evy graphical models allow the construction of flexible, sparse dependence models for L\'evy processes in large dimensions, which are interpretable thanks to the underlying graph. For trees, we develop statistical methodology to learn the underlying structure from low- or high-frequency observations of the L\'evy process and show consistent graph recovery.

"PDEs for the joint distributions of the Dyson, Airy and Sine processes","Mark Adler, Pierre van Moerbeke","In a celebrated paper, Dyson shows that the spectrum of an n\times n random Hermitian matrix, diffusing according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, evolves as n noncolliding Brownian motions held together by a drift term. The universal edge and bulk scalings for Hermitian random matrices, applied to the Dyson process, lead to the Airy and Sine processes. In particular, the Airy process is a continuous stationary process, describing the motion of the outermost particle of the Dyson Brownian motion, when the number of particles gets large, with space and time appropriately rescaled. In this paper, we answer a question posed by Kurt Johansson, to find a PDE for the joint distribution of the Airy process at two different times. Similarly we find a PDE satisfied by the joint distribution of the Sine process. This hinges on finding a PDE for the joint distribution of the Dyson process, which itself is based on the joint probability of the eigenvalues for coupled Gaussian Hermitian matrices. The PDE for the Dyson process is then subjected to an asymptotic analysis, consistent with the edge and bulk rescalings. The PDEs enable one to compute the asymptotic behavior of the joint distribution and the correlation for these processes at different times t_1 and t_2, when t_2-t_1\to \infty, as illustrated in this paper for the Airy process. This paper also contains a rigorous proof that the extended Hermite kernel, governing the joint probabilities for the Dyson process, converges to the extended Airy and Sine kernels after the appropriate rescalings.",2004-03-29T21:46:16Z,2005-09-06T08:06:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0403504v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0403504v4,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 60G60, 60G65, 35Q53 (Primary) 60G10, 35Q58.

Random-step Markov processes,"Neal Bushaw, Karen Gunderson, Steven Kalikow","We explore two notions of stationary processes. The first is called a random-step Markov process in which the stationary process of states, $(X_i)_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ has a stationary coupling with an independent process on the positive integers, $(L_i)_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of `random look-back distances'. That is,   $L_0$ is independent of the `past states', $(X_i, L_i)_{i<0}$, and for every positive integer $n$, the probability distribution on the `present', $X_0$, conditioned on the event $\{L_0 = n\}$ and on the past is the same as the probability distribution on $X_0$ conditioned on the `$n$-past', $(X_i)_{-n\leq i <0}$ and $\{L_0 = n\}$. A random Markov process is a generalization of a Markov chain of order $n$ and has the property that the distribution on the present given the past can be uniformly approximated given the $n$-past, for $n$ sufficiently large. Processes with the latter property are called uniform martingales, closely related to the notion of a `continuous $g$-function'.   We show that every stationary process on a countable alphabet that is a uniform martingale and is dominated by a finite measure is also a random Markov process and that the random variables $(L_i)_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ and associated coupling can be chosen so that the distribution on the present given the $n$-past and the event $\{L_0 = n\}$ is `deterministic': all probabilities are in $\{0,1\}$. In the case of finite alphabets, those random-step Markov processes for which $L_0$ can be chosen with finite expected value are characterized. For stationary processes on an uncountable alphabet, a stronger condition is also considered which is sufficient to imply that a process is a random Markov processes. In addition, a number of examples are given throughout to show the sharpness of the results.",2014-10-06T16:56:19Z,2014-10-06T16:56:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1457v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1457v1,"math.PR, math.DS, 37A05, 37A35, 60G10, 60G48"
"MimickNet, Matching Clinical Post-Processing Under Realistic Black-Box   Constraints","Ouwen Huang, Will Long, Nick Bottenus, Gregg E. Trahey, Sina Farsiu, Mark L. Palmeri","Image post-processing is used in clinical-grade ultrasound scanners to improve image quality (e.g., reduce speckle noise and enhance contrast). These post-processing techniques vary across manufacturers and are generally kept proprietary, which presents a challenge for researchers looking to match current clinical-grade workflows. We introduce a deep learning framework, MimickNet, that transforms raw conventional delay-and-summed (DAS) beams into the approximate post-processed images found on clinical-grade scanners. Training MimickNet only requires post-processed image samples from a scanner of interest without the need for explicit pairing to raw DAS data. This flexibility allows it to hypothetically approximate any manufacturer's post-processing without access to the pre-processed data. MimickNet generates images with an average similarity index measurement (SSIM) of 0.930$\pm$0.0892 on a 300 cineloop test set, and it generalizes to cardiac cineloops outside of our train-test distribution achieving an SSIM of 0.967$\pm$0.002. We also explore the theoretical SSIM achievable by evaluating MimickNet performance when trained under gray-box constraints (i.e., when both pre-processed and post-processed images are available). To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish deep learning models that closely approximate current clinical-grade ultrasound post-processing under realistic black-box constraints where before and after post-processing data is unavailable. MimickNet serves as a clinical post-processing baseline for future works in ultrasound image formation to compare against. To this end, we have made the MimickNet software open source.",2019-08-15T22:10:41Z,2019-08-15T22:10:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05782v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, stat.ML"
Cache-Efficient Fork-Processing Patterns on Large Graphs,"Shengliang Lu, Shixuan Sun, Johns Paul, Yuchen Li, Bingsheng He","As large graph processing emerges, we observe a costly fork-processing pattern (FPP) that is common in many graph algorithms. The unique feature of the FPP is that it launches many independent queries from different source vertices on the same graph. For example, an algorithm in analyzing the network community profile can execute Personalized PageRanks that start from tens of thousands of source vertices at the same time. We study the efficiency of handling FPPs in state-of-the-art graph processing systems on multi-core architectures. We find that those systems suffer from severe cache miss penalty because of the irregular and uncoordinated memory accesses in processing FPPs.   In this paper, we propose ForkGraph, a cache-efficient FPP processing system on multi-core architectures. To improve the cache reuse, we divide the graph into partitions each sized of LLC capacity, and the queries in an FPP are buffered and executed on the partition basis. We further develop efficient intra- and inter-partition execution strategies for efficiency. For intra-partition processing, since the graph partition fits into LLC, we propose to execute each graph query with efficient sequential algorithms (in contrast with parallel algorithms in existing parallel graph processing systems) and present an atomic-free query processing by consolidating contending operations to cache-resident graph partition. For inter-partition processing, we propose yielding and priority-based scheduling, to reduce redundant work in processing. Besides, we theoretically prove that ForkGraph performs the same amount of work, to within a constant factor, as the fastest known sequential algorithms in FPP queries processing, which is work efficient. Our evaluations on real-world graphs show that ForkGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph processing systems with two orders of magnitude speedups.",2021-03-27T14:29:04Z,2021-04-11T01:05:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14915v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14915v2,"cs.DB, cs.DC, H.2"
Outcome-Oriented Prescriptive Process Monitoring Based on Temporal Logic   Patterns,"Ivan Donadello, Chiara Di Francescomarino, Fabrizio Maria Maggi, Francesco Ricci, Aladdin Shikhizada","Prescriptive Process Monitoring systems recommend, during the execution of a business process, interventions that, if followed, prevent a negative outcome of the process. Such interventions have to be reliable, that is, they have to guarantee the achievement of the desired outcome or performance, and they have to be flexible, that is, they have to avoid overturning the normal process execution or forcing the execution of a given activity. Most of the existing Prescriptive Process Monitoring solutions, however, while performing well in terms of recommendation reliability, provide the users with very specific (sequences of) activities that have to be executed without caring about the feasibility of these recommendations. In order to face this issue, we propose a new Outcome-Oriented Prescriptive Process Monitoring system recommending temporal relations between activities that have to be guaranteed during the process execution in order to achieve a desired outcome. This softens the mandatory execution of an activity at a given point in time, thus leaving more freedom to the user in deciding the interventions to put in place. Our approach defines these temporal relations with Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces patterns that are used as features to describe the historical process data recorded in an event log by the information systems supporting the execution of the process. Such encoded log is used to train a Machine Learning classifier to learn a mapping between the temporal patterns and the outcome of a process execution. The classifier is then queried at runtime to return as recommendations the most salient temporal patterns to be satisfied to maximize the likelihood of a certain outcome for an input ongoing process execution. The proposed system is assessed using a pool of 22 real-life event logs that have already been used as a benchmark in the Process Mining community.",2022-11-09T13:36:07Z,2023-08-21T07:53:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04880v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04880v3,"cs.AI, cs.LO, I.2.6; I.2.4"
Extending JumpProcess.jl for fast point process simulation with   time-varying intensities,"Guilherme Augusto Zagatti, Samuel A.

We show that JumpProcesses.jl is a fast, general-purpose library for simulating point processes. JumpProcesses.jl was first developed for simulating jump processes via stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs) (including Doob's method, Gillespie's methods, and Kinetic Monte Carlo methods). Historically, jump processes have been developed in the context of dynamical systems to describe dynamics with discrete jumps. In contrast, the development of point processes has been more focused on describing the occurrence of random events. In this paper, we bridge the gap between the treatment of point and jump process simulation. The algorithms previously included in JumpProcesses.jl can be mapped to three general methods developed in statistics for simulating evolutionary point processes. Our comparative exercise revealed that the library initially lacked an efficient algorithm for simulating processes with variable intensity rates. We, therefore, extended JumpProcesses.jl with a new simulation algorithm, Coevolve, that enables the rapid simulation of processes with locally-bounded variable intensity rates. It is now possible to efficiently simulate any point process on the real line with a non-negative, left-continuous, history-adapted and locally bounded intensity rate coupled or not with differential equations.

Gamma Tilting Calculus for GGC and Dirichlet means with applications to   Linnik processes and Occupation Time Laws for Randomly Skewed Bessel   Processes and Bridges,Lancelot F. James,"This paper develops some general calculus for GGC and Dirichlet process means functionals. It then proceeds via an investigation of positive Linnik random variables, and more generally random variables derived from compositions of a stable subordinator with GGC subordinators, to establish various distributional equivalences between these models and phenomena connected to local times and occupation times of what are defined as randomly skewed Bessel processes and bridges. This yields a host of interesting identities and explicit density formula for these models. Randomly skewed Bessel processes and bridges may be seen as a randomization of their p-skewed counterparts developed in Barlow, Pitman and Yor (1989) and Pitman and Yor (1997), and are shown to naturally arise via exponential tilting. As a special result it is shown that the occupation time of a p-skewed random Bessel process or (generalized) bridge is equivalent in distribution to the occupation time of a non-trivial randomly skewed process.",2006-10-06T07:03:03Z,2006-11-07T07:17:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610218v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0610218v3,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
A Canonical Ensemble Approach to the Fermion/Boson Random Point   Processes and its Applications,"H. Tamura, K. R. Ito","We introduce the boson and the fermion point processes from the elementary quantum mechanical point of view. That is, we consider quantum statistical mechanics of canonical ensemble for a fixed number of particles which obey Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac statistics, respectively, in a finite volume. Focusing on the distribution of positions of the particles, we have point processes of the fixed number of points in a bounded domain. By taking the thermodynamic limit such that the particle density converges to a finite value, the boson/fermion processes are obtained. This argument is a realization of the equivalence of ensembles, since resulting processes are considered to describe a grand canonical ensemble of points. Random point processes corresponding to para-particles of order two are discussed as an application of the formulation. A statistics of a system of composite particles at zero temperature are also considered as a model of determinantal random point processes.",2005-01-21T04:49:09Z,2006-02-01T04:14:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0501053v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0501053v4,"math-ph, math.MP, 60G55; 82B21"
Two-dimensional Markovian holonomy fields,Thierry L√©vy,"We define a notion of Markov process indexed by curves drawn on a compact surface and taking its values in a compact Lie group. We call such a process a two-dimensional Markovian holonomy field. The prototype of this class of processes, and the only one to have been constructed before the present work, is the canonical process under the Yang-Mills measure, first defined by Ambar Sengupta and later by the author . The Yang-Mills measure sits in the class of Markovian holonomy fields very much like the Brownian motion in the class of Levy processes. We prove that every regular Markovian holonomy field determines a Levy process of a certain class on the Lie group in which it takes its values, and construct, for each Levy process in this class, a Markovian holonomy field to which it is associated. When the Lie group is in fact a finite group, we give an alternative construction of this Markovian holonomy field as the monodromy of a random ramified principal bundle.",2008-04-14T17:33:16Z,2008-04-14T17:33:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2230v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.2230v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 60G60, 60J99, 60G51, 60B15, 57M20, 57M12, 81T13, 81T27"

Fluctuations in the characteristic directions have order of magnitude $t^{1/3}$. This is in agreement with the expectation that these systems lie in the same KPZ universality class as the asymmetric simple exclusion process. The result is via a robust argument formulated for a broad class of deposition-type processes.

On the long time behavior of the TCP window size process,"Djalil Chafai, Florent Malrieu, Katy Paroux","The TCP window size process appears in the modeling of the famous Transmission Control Protocol used for data transmission over the Internet. This continuous time Markov process takes its values in $[0,\infty)$, is ergodic and irreversible. It belongs to the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease class of processes. The sample paths are piecewise linear deterministic and the whole randomness of the dynamics comes from the jump mechanism. Several aspects of this process have already been investigated in the literature. In the present paper, we mainly get quantitative estimates for the convergence to equilibrium, in terms of the $W_1$ Wasserstein coupling distance, for the process and also for its embedded chain.",2008-11-13T20:10:38Z,2009-12-16T08:01:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2180v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2180v3,"math.PR, cs.NI, 68M12, 60K30, 60K25, 90B18"
Note on radial Dunkl processes,Nizar Demni,"We give shorter proofs of the following known results: the radial Dunkl process associated with a reduced system and a strictly positive multiplicity function is the unique strong solution for all times of a stochastic differential equation with a singular drift, the first hitting time of the Weyl chamber by a radial Dunkl process is finite almost surely for small values of the multiplicity function. Compared to the original proofs, ours give more information on the behavior of the process. More precisely, the first proof allows to give a positive answer to a conjecture announced by Gallardo and Yor for the finiteness of the total length of the jumps performed by the Dunkl process during a finite amount of time, while the second one shows that the process hits almost surely the wall corresponding to the simple root with a small multiplicity value.

The former notion originates from the models of the axiom system ACP. The latter notion is a simple generalization of the former notion to processes in which data are involved, the mathematical structure of data being a meadow. Moreover, for all associative operators from the signature of meadow enriched ACP process algebras that are not of an auxiliary nature, we introduce variable-binding operators as generalizations. These variable-binding operators, which give rise to comprehended terms, have the property that they can always be eliminated. Thus, we obtain a process calculus whose terms can be interpreted in all meadow enriched ACP process algebras.

We also define $X^p(t)$ as a certain continuous time periodically correlated (PC) process where its covariance function is generated by the covariance function of a discrete time through defining some simple random measure on real line. We also impose a bi-periodic correlation for this PC process with $X^{ls}(t)$. The existence of such random measure is proved.

Segmentation algorithm for non-stationary compound Poisson processes,"Bence Toth, Fabrizio Lillo, J.

The segmentation algorithm is a non parametric statistical method able to identify the regimes (patches) of the time series. The process is composed of consecutive patches of variable length, each patch being described by a stationary compound Poisson process, i.e. a Poisson process where each count is associated to a fluctuating signal. The parameters of the process are different in each patch and therefore the time series is non stationary. Our method is a generalization of the algorithm introduced by Bernaola-Galvan, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 87, 168105 (2001). We show that the new algorithm outperforms the original one for regime switching compound Poisson processes. As an application we use the algorithm to segment the time series of the inventory of market members of the London Stock Exchange and we observe that our method finds almost three times more patches than the original one.",2010-01-14T20:25:55Z,2011-02-09T21:22:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2549v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2549v2,"physics.data-an, physics.soc-ph, q-fin.ST, q-fin.TR"

The stable subordinator, inverse stable subordinator and their iterated versions are also considered as time-changes. DDE's corresponding to probability mass functions of these time-changed processes are obtained. Finally, we obtain a new governing partial differential equation for the tempered stable subordinator of index $0<\beta<1,$ when $\beta $ is a rational number. We then use this result to obtain the governing DDE for the mass function of Poisson process time-changed by tempered stable subordinator.

Markov processes follow from the principle of Maximum Caliber,"Hao Ge, Steve Presse, Kingshuk Ghosh, Ken Dill","Markov models are widely used to describe processes of stochastic dynamics. Here, we show that Markov models are a natural consequence of the dynamical principle of Maximum Caliber. First, we show that when there are different possible dynamical trajectories in a time-homogeneous process, then the only type of process that maximizes the path entropy, for any given singlet statistics, is a sequence of identical, independently distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, which is the simplest Markov process. If the data is in the form of sequentially pairwise statistics, then maximizing the caliber dictates that the process is Markovian with a uniform initial distribution. Furthermore, if an initial non-uniform dynamical distribution is known, or multiple trajectories are conditioned on an initial state, then the Markov process is still the only one that maximizes the caliber. Second, given a model, MaxCal can be used to compute the parameters of that model. We show that this procedure is equivalent to the maximum-likelihood method of inference in the theory of statistics.",2011-06-21T14:24:36Z,2011-06-22T14:00:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4212v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4212v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph, physics.chem-ph"

We investigate its properties within the more general formulation, which allows to consider process dimension as a measure of complexity of non-commutative processes: We prove lower semi-continuity, and derive an ergodic decomposition formula. Further, we obtain results on the close relationship between the canonical OOM and the concept of causal states which underlies the definition of statistical complexity.

This allows to cover the case of irregular non-smooth processes. We show that this problem has an unique optimal solution. The approximating band-limited process is obtained in time domain in a form of sinc series. To accommodate the current flow of observations, the coefficients of this series and the related band-limited process have to be changed dynamically.

The definition is inspired by ideas of [SS1,SS3]. Roughly speaking, it is obtained by subtracting two leading terms from the Coulomb potential on a growing number of charges. The functional is expected to be a good measure of disorder of a configuration of points. We give certain formulas for its expectation for general stationary random point processes. For the random matrix $\beta$-sine processes on the real line (beta=1,2,4), and Ginibre point process and zeros of Gaussian analytic functions process in the plane, we compute the expectation explicitly. Moreover, we prove that for these processes the variance of the renormalized energy vanishes, which shows concentration near the expected value.

Evolutionary Inference via the Poisson Indel Process,"Alexandre Bouchard-C√¥t√©, Michael I. Jordan","We address the problem of the joint statistical inference of phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignments from unaligned molecular sequences. This problem is generally formulated in terms of string-valued evolutionary processes along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The classical evolutionary process, the TKF91 model, is a continuous-time Markov chain model comprised of insertion, deletion and substitution events. Unfortunately this model gives rise to an intractable computational problem---the computation of the marginal likelihood under the TKF91 model is exponential in the number of taxa. In this work, we present a new stochastic process, the Poisson Indel Process (PIP), in which the complexity of this computation is reduced to linear. The new model is closely related to the TKF91 model, differing only in its treatment of insertions, but the new model has a global characterization as a Poisson process on the phylogeny. Standard results for Poisson processes allow key computations to be decoupled, which yields the favorable computational profile of inference under the PIP model. We present illustrative experiments in which Bayesian inference under the PIP model is compared to separate inference of phylogenies and alignments.",2012-07-26T16:52:10Z,2013-01-18T16:32:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6327v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6327v2,"q-bio.PE, stat.AP, stat.CO"

A variational approach to modeling slow processes in stochastic   dynamical systems,"Frank No√©, Feliks N√ºske","The slow processes of metastable stochastic dynamical systems are difficult to access by direct numerical simulation due the sampling problem. Here, we suggest an approach for modeling the slow parts of Markov processes by approximating the dominant eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the propagator. To this end, a variational principle is derived that is based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coefficient. It is shown that this Rayleigh coefficient can be estimated from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from different parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and efficient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with finite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena.",2012-11-29T21:52:23Z,2012-11-29T21:52:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.7103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.7103v1,"math-ph, math.MP, math.ST, physics.chem-ph, stat.TH"
A stochastic diffusion process for the Dirichlet distribution,"J. Bakosi, J. R.

To ensure a bounded sample space, a coupled nonlinear diffusion process is required: the Wiener-processes in the equivalent system of stochastic differential equations are multiplicative with coefficients dependent on all the stochastic variables. Individual samples of a discrete ensemble, obtained from the stochastic process, satisfy a unit-sum constraint at all times. The process may be used to represent realizations of a fluctuating ensemble of N variables subject to a conservation principle. Similar to the multivariate Wright-Fisher process, whose invariant is also Dirichlet, the univariate case yields a process whose invariant is the beta distribution.

On the spectral gap of the kac walk and other binary collision processes   on $d$-dimensional lattice,Makiko Sasada,"We give a lower bound on the spectral gap for a class of binary collision processes. In 2008, Caputo showed that, for a class of binary collision processes given by simple averages on the complete graph, the analysis of the spectral gap of an $N$-component system is reduced to that of the same system for N=3 In this paper, we give a comparison technique to reduce the analysis of the spectral gap of binary collision processes given by simple averages on $d$-dimensional lattice to that on the complete graph. We also give a comparison technique to reduce the analysis of the spectral gap of binary collision processes which are not given by simple averages to that given by simple averages. Combining them with Caputo's result, we give a new and elementary method to obtain spectral gap estimates. The method applies to a number of binary collision processes on the complete graph and also on d-dimensional lattice, including a class of energy exchange models which was recently introduced in by Grigo et al., and zero-range processes.",2013-08-23T11:01:45Z,2013-08-23T11:01:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5096v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.5096v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, primary 60K35, secondary 82C31"
Distributed Business Processes - A Framework for Modeling and Execution,"J. Kotremba, S. Ra√ü, R. Singer","Commercially available business process management systems (BPMS) still suffer to support organizations to enact their business processes in an effective and efficient way. Current BPMS, in general, are based on BPMN 2.0 and/or BPEL. It is well known, that these approaches have some restrictions according modeling and immediate transfer of the model into executable code. Recently, a method for modeling and execution of business processes, named subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM), gained attention. This methodology facilitates modeling of any business process using only five symbols and allows direct execution based on such models. Further on, this methodology has a strong theoretical and formal basis realizing distributed systems; any process is defined as a network of independent and distributed agents - i.e. instances of subjects - which coordinate work through the exchange of messages. In this work, we present a framework and a prototype based on off-the-shelf technologies as a possible realization of the S-BPM methodology. We can prove and demonstrate the principal architecture concept; these results should also stimulate a discussion about actual BPMS and its underlying concepts.",2013-09-12T12:02:21Z,2014-05-18T14:53:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3126v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.3126v2,"cs.MA, cs.SE, D.2.12"
"Generalized Hermite processes, discrete chaos and limit theorems","Shuyang Bai, Murad S.

They have stationary increments, are defined on a Wiener chaos with Hurst index $H\in (1/2,1)$, and include Hermite processes as a special case. They are defined through a homogeneous kernel $g$, called ""generalized Hermite kernel"", which replaces the product of power functions in the definition of Hermite processes. The generalized Hermite kernels $g$ can also be used to generate long-range dependent stationary sequences forming a discrete chaos process $\{X(n)\}$. In addition, we consider a fractionally-filtered version $Z^\beta(t)$ of $Z(t)$, which allows $H\in (0,1/2)$. Corresponding non-central limit theorems are established.

Numerical proof of existence of fractional powers of Wiener processes,"Marco Frasca, Alfonso Farina","Using the Euler--Maruyama technique, we show that a class of Wiener processes exist that are obtained by computing an arbitrary positive power of them. This can be accomplished with a proper set of definitions that makes meaningful the realization at discrete times of these processes and make them computable. Standard results from It\=o calculus for integer powers hold as we are just extending them. We provide the results from a Monte Carlo simulation with a large number of samples. We yield evidence for the existence of these processes by recovering from them the standard Brownian motion we started with after power elevation.

The robustness of proofreading to crowding-induced pseudo-processivity   in the MAPK pathway,"Thomas E. Ouldridge, Pieter Rein ten Wolde","Double phosphorylation of protein kinases is a common feature of signalling cascades. This motif may reduce cross-talk between signalling pathways, as the second phosphorylation site allows for proofreading, especially when phosphorylation is distributive rather than processive. Recent studies suggest that phosphorylation can be `pseudo-processive' in the crowded cellular environment, as rebinding after the first phosphorylation is enhanced by slow diffusion. Here, we use a simple model with unsaturated reactants to show that specificity for one substrate over another drops as rebinding increases and pseudo-processive behavior becomes possible. However, this loss of specificity with increased rebinding is typically also observed if two distinct enzyme species are required for phosphorylation, i.e. when the system is necessarily distributive. Thus the loss of specificity is due to an intrinsic reduction in selectivity with increased rebinding, which benefits inefficient reactions, rather than pseudo-processivity itself. We also show that proofreading can remain effective when the intended signalling pathway exhibits high levels of rebinding-induced pseudo-processivity, unlike other proposed advantages of the dual phosphorylation motif.",2014-07-06T14:34:03Z,2014-11-07T12:36:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1499v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1499v2,"q-bio.MN, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.SC"
Dynamic Nested Clustering for Parallel PHY-Layer Processing in   Cloud-RANs,"Congmin Fan, Ying Jun Zhang, Xiaojun Yuan","Featured by centralized processing and cloud based infrastructure, Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is a promising solution to achieve an unprecedented system capacity in future wireless cellular networks. The huge capacity gain mainly comes from the centralized and coordinated signal processing at the cloud server. However, full-scale coordination in a large-scale C-RAN requires the processing of very large channel matrices, leading to high computational complexity and channel estimation overhead. To resolve this challenge, we exploit the near-sparsity of large C-RAN channel matrices, and derive a unified theoretical framework for clustering and parallel processing. Based on the framework, we propose a dynamic nested clustering (DNC) algorithm that not only greatly improves the system scalability in terms of baseband-processing and channel-estimation complexity, but also is amenable to various parallel processing strategies for different data center architectures. With the proposed algorithm, we show that the computation time for the optimal linear detector is greatly reduced from $O(N^3)$ to no higher than $O(N^{\frac{42}{23}})$, where $N$ is the number of RRHs in C-RAN.",2014-08-05T06:32:44Z,2014-12-27T11:59:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0876v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.0876v2,"cs.IT, cs.DC, math.IT"

While information-theoretic approaches to the multiscale analysis of complex dynamics are being increasingly used, the theoretical properties of the applied measures are poorly understood. This study introduces for the first time a framework for the analytical computation of information dynamics for linear multivariate stochastic processes explored at different time scales. After showing that the multiscale processing of a vector autoregressive (VAR) process introduces a moving average (MA) component, we describe how to represent the resulting VARMA process using state-space (SS) models and how to exploit the SS model parameters to compute analytical measures of information storage and information transfer for the original and rescaled processes. The framework is then used to quantify multiscale information dynamics for simulated unidirectionally and bidirectionally coupled VAR processes, showing that rescaling may lead to insightful patterns of information storage and transfer but also to potentially misleading behaviors.",2016-02-19T14:05:26Z,2016-02-24T20:22:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06155v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06155v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, physics.data-an"
Bounded Turing Reductions and Data Processing Inequalities for Sequences,Adam Case,"A data processing inequality states that the quantity of shared information between two entities (e.g. signals, strings) cannot be significantly increased when one of the entities is processed by certain kinds of transformations.

We show that, for all sequences $X,Y,$ and $Z$, if $Z$ is computable Lipschitz reducible to $X$, then \[ mdim(Z:Y) \leq mdim(X:Y) \text{ and } Mdim(Z:Y) \leq Mdim(X:Y). \] We also show how to derive different data processing inequalities by making adjustments to the computable bounds of the use of a Turing functional.   The yield of a Turing functional $\Phi^S$ with access to at most $n$ bits of the oracle $S$ is the smallest input $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\Phi^{S \upharpoonright n}(m)\uparrow$.

These processes are obtained by performing an independent Bernoulli percolation on the particle configuration of of a log-gas confined in a general potential. We show that, depending on the expected number of deleted particles, there is a universal transition for mesoscopic statistics. Namely, at small scales, the point process still behaves according to random matrix theory, while, at large scales, it needs to be renormalized because the variance of any linear statistic diverges. The crossover is explicitly characterized as the superposition of a H^{1/2}- or H^1- correlated Gaussian noise and an independent Poisson process. The proof consists in computing the limits of the cumulants of linear statistics using the asymptotics of the correlation kernel of the process.",2016-12-02T19:35:28Z,2019-07-22T09:01:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00806v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00806v2,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 60B20, 60F05, 60G55, 78M05"
A variational derivation of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a moist   atmosphere with rain process and its pseudoincompressible approximation,Fran√ßois Gay-Balmaz,"Irreversible processes play a major role in the description and prediction of atmospheric dynamics. In this paper, we present a variational derivation of the evolution equations for a moist atmosphere with rain process and subject to the irreversible processes of viscosity, heat conduction, diffusion, and phase transition. This derivation is based on a general variational formalism for nonequilibrium thermodynamics which extends Hamilton's principle to incorporates irreversible processes. It is valid for any state equation and thus also covers the case of the atmosphere of other planets. In this approach, the second law of thermodynamics is understood as a nonlinear constraint formulated with the help of new variables, called thermodynamic displacements, whose time derivative coincides with the thermodynamic force of the irreversible process. The formulation is written both in the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions and can be directly adapted to oceanic dynamics. We illustrate the efficiency of our variational formulation as a modeling tool in atmospheric thermodynamics, by deriving a pseudoincompressible model for moist atmospheric thermodynamics with general equations of state and subject to the irreversible processes of viscosity, heat conduction, diffusion, and phase transition.",2017-01-14T13:34:43Z,2018-04-25T22:13:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03921v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03921v2,"math-ph, math.MP, physics.flu-dyn"

Our analysis is based on rate-distortion theory and the theory of finite point processes. We introduce fundamental information-theoretic concepts and quantities for point processes and present general lower and upper bounds on the rate-distortion function. To enable a comparison with the vector setting, we concretize our bounds for point processes of fixed cardinality. In particular, we analyze a fixed number of unordered Gaussian data points and show that we can significantly reduce the required rates compared to the best possible compression strategy for Gaussian vectors. As an example of point processes with variable cardinality, we study the best possible compression of Poisson point processes. For the specific case of a Poisson point process with uniform intensity on the unit square, our lower and upper bounds are separated by only a small gap and thus provide a good characterization of the rate-distortion function.",2017-04-19T14:52:39Z,2018-05-22T10:08:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05758v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05758v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, math.PR, 94A34, 60G55"

Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the primary model for sequential decision problems with a large or indefinite time horizon. Choosing a representation of the underlying decision process that is both Markov and low-dimensional is non-trivial. We propose a method for constructing a low-dimensional representation of the original decision process for which: 1. the MDP model holds; 2. a decision strategy that maximizes mean utility when applied to the low-dimensional representation also maximizes mean utility when applied to the original process. We use a deep neural network to define a class of potential process representations and estimate the process of lowest dimension within this class.

Achlioptas process, a class of variants of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi process that are easy to define but difficult to analyze, have been extensively studied from this point of view. Here, settling a number of conjectures and open problems, we show that all `bounded-size' Achlioptas processes share (in a strong sense) all the key features of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi phase transition.

It has been shown that simple linear processes driven by correlated additive and multiplicative (CAM) Gaussian noise, which emerge in the context of atmosphere and ocean dynamics, have infinite variance in certain parameter regimes.   In this paper, we study a stochastic averaging problem where a linear CAM noise process in a particular parameter regime is used to drive a comparatively slow process. It is shown that the slow process exhibits properties consistent with being forced by a white {\alpha}-stable noise in the case of large time-scale separation. We identify the conditions required for the fast linear CAM process to have such an influence in driving a slower process, and then derive an (effectively) equivalent fast, infinite-variance process for which an existing stochastic averaging approximation is readily applied.

The conditions of breaking of the synchronization of the process, increase in the multiplicity of a cyclicity, and appearance of chaotic modes are studied. The phase-parametric diagrams of a cascade of bifurcations, which characterize the transition to chaotic modes according to the Feigenbaum scenario and the intermittence, are constructed.

We work in the framework of empirical Bayes, where a point estimate of the hyper-parameters is computed, using the data, and then used within the standard Gaussian process prior to posterior update. We provide a convergence analysis that (i) holds for any continuous function $f$ to be emulated; and (ii) shows that convergence of Gaussian process regression is unaffected by the additional learning of hyper-parameters from data, and is guaranteed in a wide range of scenarios.

We propose a model to describe the adaptive diffusion process of local topological and dynamical information, and find that the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (BA network) is beneficial to the diffusion and leads nodes to arrive at a larger state value than other networks do. The ability of diffusion for a node is related to its own degree. Specifically, nodes with smaller degrees are more likely to change their states and reach larger values, while those with larger degrees tend to stick to their original states. We introduce state entropy to analyze the thermodynamic mechanism of the diffusion process, and interestingly find that this kind of diffusion process is a minimization process of state entropy. We use the inequality constrained optimization method to reveal the restriction function of the minimization and find that it has the same form as the Gibbs free energy. The thermodynamical concept allows us to understand dynamical processes on complex networks from a brand-new perspective.

As casting is a thermal process with many interacting process parameters, root cause analysis tends to be tedious and ineffective. We show how a decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which is guided by a knowledge-based initialization strategy, is able to extract physical meaningful sources from temperature time series collected during a thermal manufacturing process. The approach assumes the time series to be generated by a superposition of several simultaneously acting component processes. NMF is able to reverse the superposition and to identify the hidden component processes. The latter can be linked to ongoing physical phenomena and process variables, which cannot be monitored directly. Our approach provides new insights into the underlying physics and offers a tool, which can assist in diagnosing defect causes. We demonstrate our method by applying it to real world data, collected in a foundry during the series production of casting parts for the automobile industry.",2019-04-03T19:46:56Z,2019-04-03T19:46:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02217v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02217v1,"cs.LG, cs.CV, physics.app-ph, stat.ML"
A Bayesian Theory of Change Detection in Statistically Periodic Random   Processes,"Taposh Banerjee, Prudhvi Gurram, Gene Whipps","A new class of stochastic processes called independent and periodically identically distributed (i.p.i.d.) processes is defined to capture periodically varying statistical behavior. A novel Bayesian theory is developed for detecting a change in the distribution of an i.p.i.d. process. It is shown that the Bayesian change point problem can be expressed as a problem of optimal control of a Markov decision process (MDP) with periodic transition and cost structures. Optimal control theory is developed for periodic MDPs for discounted and undiscounted total cost criteria. A fixed-point equation is obtained that is satisfied by the optimal cost function. It is shown that the optimal policy for the MDP is nonstationary but periodic in nature. A value iteration algorithm is obtained to compute the optimal cost function. The results from the MDP theory are then applied to detect changes in i.p.i.d. processes. It is shown that while the optimal change point algorithm is a stopping rule based on a periodic sequence of thresholds, a single-threshold policy is asymptotically optimal, as the probability of false alarm goes to zero. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the asymptotically optimal policy is not strictly optimal.",2019-04-06T20:57:19Z,2019-04-06T20:57:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03530v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03530v1,"eess.SP, cs.IT, math.IT, math.ST, stat.TH"
Nonparametric drift estimation for diffusions with jumps driven by a   Hawkes process,"Charlotte Dion, Sarah Lemler",We consider a 1-dimensional diffusion process X with jumps. The particularity of this model relies in the jumps which are driven by a multidimensional Hawkes process denoted N. This article is dedicated to the study of a nonparametric estimator of the drift coefficient of this original process. We construct estimators based on discrete observations of the process X in a high frequency framework with a large horizon time and on the observations of the process N. The proposed nonparametric estimator is built from a least squares contrast procedure on subspace spanned by trigonometric basis vectors. We obtain adaptive results that are comparable with the one obtained in the nonparametric regression context. We finally conduct a simulation study in which we first focus on the implementation of the process and then on showing the good behavior of the estimator.,2019-04-17T12:44:39Z,2019-11-04T11:03:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08232v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08232v2,"math.ST, stat.AP, stat.TH"
Current fluctuations for independent random walks in multiple dimensions,Rohini Kumar,"Consider a system of particles evolving as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random walks. Initial fluctuations in the particle density get translated over time with velocity $\vec{v}$, the common mean velocity of the random walks. Consider a box centered around an observer who starts at the origin and moves with constant velocity $\vec{v}$. To observe interesting fluctuations beyond the translation of initial density fluctuations, we measure the net flux of particles over time into this moving box. We call this the ``box-current"" process.   We generalize this current process to a distribution valued process. Scaling time by $n$ and space by $\sqrt{n}$ gives current fluctuations of order $n^{d/4}$ where $d$ is the space dimension. The scaling limit of the normalized current process is a distribution valued Gaussian process with given covariance. The limiting current process is equal in distribution to the solution of a given stochastic partial differential equation which is related to the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.",2010-09-14T18:53:30Z,2010-09-14T18:53:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2732v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.2732v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 60K35, 60F10"

Authentication Modeling with Five Generic Processes,"Sabah Al-Fedaghi, MennatAllah Bayoumi","Conceptual modeling is an essential tool in many fields of study, including security specification in information technology systems. As a model, it restricts access to resources and identifies possible threats to the system. We claim that current modeling languages (e.g., Unified Modeling Language, Business Process Model and Notation) lack the notion of genericity, which refers to a limited set of elementary processes. This paper proposes five generic processes for modeling the structural behavior of a system: creating, releasing, transferring, receiving, and processing. The paper demonstrates these processes within the context of public key infrastructure, biometric, and multifactor authentication. The results indicate that the proposed generic processes are sufficient to represent these authentication schemes.",2019-09-30T21:49:53Z,2019-09-30T21:49:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01597v1,"cs.OH, cs.CR, cs.SE"
Discrete Processes and their Continuous Limits,Uri M. Ascher,"The possibility that a discrete process can be fruitfully approximated by a continuous one, with the latter involving a differential system, is fascinating. Important theoretical insights, as well as significant computational efficiency gains may lie in store. A great success story in this regard are the Navier-Stokes equations, which model many phenomena in fluid flow rather well. Recent years saw many attempts to formulate more such continuous limits, and thus harvest theoretical and practical advantages, in diverse areas including mathematical biology, image processing, game theory, computational optimization, and machine learning.   Caution must be applied as well, however. In fact, it is often the case that the given discrete process is richer in possibilities than its continuous differential system limit, and that a further study of the discrete process is practically rewarding. Furthermore, there are situations where the continuous limit process may provide important qualitative, but not quantitative, information about the actual discrete process. This paper considers several case studies of such continuous limits and demonstrates success as well as cause for caution. Consequences are discussed.",2019-10-04T18:23:28Z,2020-04-24T16:07:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02098v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02098v3,"math.NA, cs.NA, Primary: 65K05, 65L04, Secondary: 68U10"
MAGMA: Inference and Prediction with Multi-Task Gaussian Processes,"Arthur Leroy, Pierre Latouche, Benjamin Guedj, Servane Gey","A novel multi-task Gaussian process (GP) framework is proposed, by using a common mean process for sharing information across tasks. In particular, we investigate the problem of time series forecasting, with the objective to improve multiple-step-ahead predictions. The common mean process is defined as a GP for which the hyper-posterior distribution is tractable. Therefore an EM algorithm is derived for handling both hyper-parameters optimisation and hyper-posterior computation. Unlike previous approaches in the literature, the model fully accounts for uncertainty and can handle irregular grids of observations while maintaining explicit formulations, by modelling the mean process in a unified GP framework. Predictive analytical equations are provided, integrating information shared across tasks through a relevant prior mean. This approach greatly improves the predictive performances, even far from observations, and may reduce significantly the computational complexity compared to traditional multi-task GP models. Our overall algorithm is called \textsc{Magma} (standing for Multi tAsk Gaussian processes with common MeAn).

In contrast with scalar risk measures, this equivalence requires an augmentation of the set-valued risk measures for processes. We utilize this result to deduce a new dual representation for risk measures for processes in the set-valued framework.

LQResNet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Learning Dynamic   Processes,"Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner","Mathematical modeling is an essential step, for example, to analyze the transient behavior of a dynamical process and to perform engineering studies such as optimization and control. With the help of first-principles and expert knowledge, a dynamic model can be built, but for complex dynamic processes, appearing, e.g., in biology, chemical plants, neuroscience, financial markets, this often remains an onerous task. Hence, data-driven modeling of the dynamics process becomes an attractive choice and is supported by the rapid advancement in sensor and measurement technology. A data-driven approach, namely operator inference framework, models a dynamic process, where a particular structure of the nonlinear term is assumed. In this work, we suggest combining the operator inference with certain deep neural network approaches to infer the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the system. The approach uses recent advancements in deep learning and possible prior knowledge of the process if possible. We also briefly discuss several extensions and advantages of the proposed methodology.

Flexible marked spatio-temporal point processes with applications to   event sequences from association football,"Santhosh Narayanan, Ioannis Kosmidis, Petros Dellaportas","We develop a new family of marked point processes by focusing the characteristic properties of marked Hawkes processes exclusively to the space of marks, providing the freedom to specify a different model for the occurrence times. This is possible through the decomposition of the joint distribution of marks and times that allows to separately specify the conditional distribution of marks given the filtration of the process and the current time. We develop a Bayesian framework for the inference and prediction from this family of marked point processes that can naturally accommodate process and point-specific covariate information to drive cross-excitations, offering wide flexibility and applicability in the modelling of real-world processes. The framework is used here for the modelling of in-game event sequences from association football, resulting not only in inferences about previously unquantified characteristics of game dynamics and extraction of event-specific team abilities, but also in predictions for the occurrence of events of interest, such as goals, corners or fouls in a specified interval of time.",2021-03-08T10:15:29Z,2022-10-17T09:35:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04647v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04647v3,"stat.AP, stat.ME, 62F15, 62J02, 62M99, 62P99"
Regenerativity of Viterbi process for pairwise Markov models,"J√ºri Lember, Joonas Sova","For hidden Markov models one of the most popular estimates of the hidden chain is the Viterbi path -- the path maximising the posterior probability. We consider a more general setting, called the pairwise Markov model (PMM), where the joint process consisting of finite-state hidden process and observation process is assumed to be a Markov chain. It has been recently proven that under some conditions the Viterbi path of the PMM can almost surely be extended to infinity, thereby defining the infinite Viterbi decoding of the observation sequence, called the Viterbi process. This was done by constructing a block of observations, called a barrier, which ensures that the Viterbi path goes trough a given state whenever this block occurs in the observation sequence. In this paper we prove that the joint process consisting of Viterbi process and PMM is regenerative. The proof involves a delicate construction of regeneration times which coincide with the occurrences of barriers. As one possible application of our theory, some results on the asymptotics of the Viterbi training algorithm are derived.",2021-03-15T15:01:29Z,2021-03-15T15:01:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11821v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11821v1,"cs.IT, math.IT, math.ST, stat.ML, stat.TH"

We call this process Speed Up Zig-Zag (SUZZ). We provide conditions that guarantee stability properties for the SUZZ process, including non-explosivity, exponential ergodicity in heavy tailed targets and central limit theorem.

A post-processing technique for stabilizing the discontinuous pressure   projection operator in marginally-resolved incompressible inviscid flow,"Sumedh M. Joshi, Peter J. Diamessis, Derek T. Steinmoeller, Marek Stastna, Greg N. Thomsen","A method for post-processing the velocity after a pressure projection is developed that helps to maintain stability in an under-resolved, inviscid, discontinuous element-based simulation for use in environmental fluid mechanics process studies. The post-processing method is needed because of spurious divergence growth at element interfaces due to the discontinuous nature of the discretization used. This spurious divergence eventually leads to a numerical instability. Previous work has shown that a discontinuous element-local projection onto the space of divergence-free basis functions is capable of stabilizing the projection method, but the discontinuity inherent in this technique may lead to instability in under-resolved simulations. By enforcing inter-element discontinuity and requiring a divergence-free result in the weak sense only, a new post-processing technique is developed that simultaneously improves smoothness and reduces divergence in the pressure-projected velocity field at the same time. When compared against a non-post-processed velocity field, the post-processed velocity field remains stable far longer and exhibits better smoothness and conservation properties.",2015-12-06T07:40:25Z,2015-12-06T07:40:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01755v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01755v1,"physics.comp-ph, cs.CE, math.NA"

The edge servers split out a large sum of redundant data and transmit extracted information to the center cloud for further analysis. However, for consideration of limited edge computation ability, part of the raw data in huge data sources may be directly transmitted to the cloud.

Bayesian Optimization using Deep Gaussian Processes,"Ali Hebbal, Loic Brevault, Mathieu Balesdent, El-Ghazali Talbi, Nouredine Melab","Bayesian Optimization using Gaussian Processes is a popular approach to deal with the optimization of expensive black-box functions.

This modeling technique increases the power of representation to capture the non-stationarity by simply considering a functional composition of stationary Gaussian Processes, providing a multiple layer structure. This paper proposes a new algorithm for Global Optimization by coupling Deep Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization.

It is well-known that expectation value of several observables for the Macdonald process admit determinantal expression. We find that this determinantal structure is apparent in free field realization of the corresponding operators and, furthermore, it has a natural interpretation in the language of free fermions at the Schur limit.

However, it is not always the case that the available information is in the form of a finite collection of points. For example, boundary value problems contain information on the boundary of a domain, which is an uncountable collection of points that cannot be incorporated into typical Gaussian process techniques.

Extreme Value Estimation for Discretely Sampled Continuous Processes,"Holger Drees, Laurens de Haan, Feridun Turkman","In environmental applications of extreme value statistics, the underlying stochastic process is often modeled either as a max-stable process in continuous time/space or as a process in the domain of attraction of such a max-stable process. In practice, however, the processes are typically only observed at discrete points and one has to resort to interpolation to fill in the gaps. We discuss the influence of such an interpolation on estimators of marginal parameters as well as estimators of the exponent measure. In particular, natural conditions on the fineness of the observational scheme are developed which ensure that asymptotically the interpolated estimators behave in the same way as the estimators which use fully observed continuous processes.",2017-09-20T18:44:42Z,2018-02-09T19:50:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07031v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07031v2,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62G32, 62G05, 62M30"
The language (and series) of Hammersley-type processes,"Cosmin Bonchis, Gabriel Istrate, Vlad Rochian","We study languages and formal power series associated to (variants of) Hammersley's process. We show that the ordinary Hammersley process yields a regular language and the Hammersley tree process yields deterministic context-free (but non-regular) languages. For the extension to intervals of the Hammersley process we show that there are two relevant formal languages. One of them leads to the same class of languages as the ordinary Hammersley tree process. The other one yields non-context-free languages. The results are motivated by the problem of studying the analog of the famous Ulam-Hammersley problem for heapable sequences. Towards this goal we also give an algorithm for computing formal power series associated to the variants of Hammersley's process. We employ these algorithms to settle the nature of the scaling constant, conjectured in previous work to be the golden ratio. Our results provide experimental support to this conjecture.",2018-02-09T20:04:12Z,2018-04-09T06:31:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03436v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03436v2,"cs.FL, cs.DM, math.CO, math.PR"
Positive temperature dynamics on Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns restricted by   wall,Ioanna Nteka,"The thesis focuses on processes on symplectic Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns. In chapter 4, a process with dynamics inspired by the Berele correspondence [Ber86] is presented. It is proved that the shape of the pattern is a Doob $h$-transform of independent random walks with $h$ given by the symplectic Schur function. This is followed by an extension to a $q$-weighted version. This randomised version has itself a branching structure and is related to a $q$-deformation of the $so_{2n+1}$-Whittaker functions. In chapter 5, we present a fully randomised process. This process $q$-deforms a process proposed in [WW09]. In chapter 7 we prove the convergence of the $q$-deformation of the $so_{2n+1}$-Whittaker functions to the classical $so_{2n+1}$-Whittaker functions when $q \to 1$. Finally, in chapter 8 we turn our interest to the continuous setting and construct a process on patterns which contains a positive temperature analogue of the Dyson's Brownian motion of type $B/C$. The processes obtained are $h$-transforms of Brownian motions killed at a continuous rate that depends on their distance from the boundary of the Weyl chamber of type $B/C$, with $h$ related with the $so_{2n+1}$-Whittaker functions.",2018-02-20T22:17:50Z,2018-02-20T22:17:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07359v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07359v1,"math.PR, math.CO, math.RT"
Flow Smoothing and Denoising: Graph Signal Processing in the Edge-Space,"Michael T. Schaub, Santiago Segarra","This paper focuses on devising graph signal processing tools for the treatment of data defined on the edges of a graph. We first show that conventional tools from graph signal processing may not be suitable for the analysis of such signals. More specifically, we discuss how the underlying notion of a `smooth signal' inherited from (the typically considered variants of) the graph Laplacian are not suitable when dealing with edge signals that encode a notion of flow. To overcome this limitation we introduce a class of filters based on the Edge-Laplacian, a special case of the Hodge-Laplacian for simplicial complexes of order one. We demonstrate how this Edge-Laplacian leads to low-pass filters that enforce (approximate) flow-conservation in the processed signals. Moreover, we show how these new filters can be combined with more classical Laplacian-based processing methods on the line-graph. Finally, we illustrate the developed tools by denoising synthetic traffic flows on the London street network.",2018-08-06T20:59:58Z,2018-08-06T20:59:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02111v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02111v1,"cs.DM, cs.SI, cs.SY, eess.SP"
Field-theoretic approach to the universality of branching processes,"Rosalba Garcia-Millan, Johannes Pausch, Benjamin Walter, Gunnar Pruessner","Branching processes are widely used to model phenomena from networks to neuronal avalanching. In a large class of continuous-time branching processes, we study the temporal scaling of the moments of the instant population size, the survival probability, expected avalanche duration, the so-called avalanche shape, the $n$-point correlation function and the probability density function of the total avalanche size. Previous studies have shown universality in certain observables of branching processes using probabilistic arguments, however, a comprehensive description is lacking. We derive the field theory that describes the process and demonstrate how to use it to calculate the relevant observables and their scaling to leading order in time, revealing the universality of the moments of the population size. Our results explain why the first and second moment of the offspring distribution are sufficient to fully characterise the process in the vicinity of criticality, regardless of the underlying offspring distribution. This finding implies that branching processes are universal. We illustrate our analytical results with computer simulations.",2018-08-25T12:12:48Z,2018-12-15T13:32:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08418v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08418v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"
Higher variations for free L√©vy processes,"Michael Anshelevich, Zhichao Wang","For a general free L\'evy process, we prove the existence of its higher variation processes as limits in distribution, and identify the limits in terms of the L\'evy-It\^o representation of the original process. For a general free compound Poisson process, this convergence holds in probability. This implies joint convergence in distribution to a $k$-tuple of higher variation processes, and so the existence of $k$-fold stochastic integrals as limits in probability. If the existence of moments of all orders is assumed, the result holds for free additive (not necessarily stationary) processes and more general approximants.

The equivalence of two tax processes,"Dalal Al Ghanim, Ronnie Loeffen, Alex Watson","We introduce two models of taxation, the latent and natural tax processes, which have both been used to represent loss-carry-forward taxation on the capital of an insurance company. In the natural tax process, the tax rate is a function of the current level of capital, whereas in the latent tax process, the tax rate is a function of the capital that would have resulted if no tax had been paid. Whereas up to now these two types of tax processes have been treated separately, we show that, in fact, they are essentially equivalent. This allows a unified treatment, translating results from one model to the other. Significantly, we solve the question of existence and uniqueness for the natural tax process, which is defined via an integral equation. Our results clarify the existing literature on processes with tax.",2018-11-05T13:19:21Z,2019-10-22T12:58:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01664v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01664v3,"math.PR, q-fin.PR, 60G51, 91B30, 93E20, 91G80"
Unsupervised Post-processing of Word Vectors via Conceptor Negation,"Tianlin Liu, Lyle Ungar, Jo√£o Sedoc","Word vectors are at the core of many natural language processing tasks. Recently, there has been interest in post-processing word vectors to enrich their semantic information. In this paper, we introduce a novel word vector post-processing technique based on matrix conceptors (Jaeger2014), a family of regularized identity maps. More concretely, we propose to use conceptors to suppress those latent features of word vectors having high variances. The proposed method is purely unsupervised: it does not rely on any corpus or external linguistic database. We evaluate the post-processed word vectors on a battery of intrinsic lexical evaluation tasks, showing that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art alternatives. We also show that post-processed word vectors can be used for the downstream natural language processing task of dialogue state tracking, yielding improved results in different dialogue domains.",2018-11-17T20:12:40Z,2018-12-02T10:27:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11001v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11001v2,"cs.CL, cs.LG, stat.ML"

We introduce in particular Volterra Wishart processes with fractional kernels and values in the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. They are constructed from matrix products of infinite dimensional Ornstein Uhlenbeck processes whose state space are matrix valued measures. Parallel to that we also consider positive definite Volterra pure jump processes, giving rise to multivariate Hawkes type processes. We apply these affine covariance processes for multivariate (rough) volatility modeling and introduce a (rough) multivariate Volterra Heston type model.",2019-07-02T03:54:19Z,2019-09-04T11:24:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01917v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01917v2,"math.PR, q-fin.MF, 60H15, 60J25"
Control of Status Updates for Energy Harvesting Devices that Monitor   Processes with Alarms,"George Stamatakis, Nikolaos Pappas, Apostolos Traganitis","In this work, we derive optimal transmission policies in an energy harvesting status update system. The system monitors a stochastic process which can be either in a normal or in an alarm state of operation. We capture the freshness of status updates for each state of the stochastic process by introducing two Age of Information (AoI) variables and extend the definition of AoI to account for the state changes of the stochastic process. We formulate the problem at hand as a Markov Decision Process which, under the assumption that the demand for status updates is higher when the stochastic process is in the alarm state, utilizes a transition cost function that applies linear and non-linear penalties based on AoI and the state of the stochastic process. Finally, we evaluate numerically the derived policies and illustrate their effectiveness for reserving energy in anticipation of future alarm states.",2019-07-08T19:48:13Z,2019-07-08T19:48:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03826v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03826v1,"cs.IT, cs.NI, math.IT"
GP-ALPS: Automatic Latent Process Selection for Multi-Output Gaussian   Process Models,"Pavel Berkovich, Eric Perim, Wessel Bruinsma","A simple and widely adopted approach to extend Gaussian processes (GPs) to multiple outputs is to model each output as a linear combination of a collection of shared, unobserved latent GPs. An issue with this approach is choosing the number of latent processes and their kernels. These choices are typically done manually, which can be time consuming and prone to human biases. We propose Gaussian Process Automatic Latent Process Selection (GP-ALPS), which automatically chooses the latent processes by turning off those that do not meaningfully contribute to explaining the data. We develop a variational inference scheme, assess the quality of the variational posterior by comparing it against the gold standard MCMC, and demonstrate the suitability of GP-ALPS in a set of preliminary experiments.",2019-11-05T16:46:37Z,2019-12-17T12:02:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01929v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01929v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.ME"
Integrating Markov processes with structural causal modeling enables   counterfactual inference in complex systems,"Robert Osazuwa Ness, Kaushal Paneri, Olga Vitek","This manuscript contributes a general and practical framework for casting a Markov process model of a system at equilibrium as a structural causal model, and carrying out counterfactual inference. Markov processes mathematically describe the mechanisms in the system, and predict the system's equilibrium behavior upon intervention, but do not support counterfactual inference. In contrast, structural causal models support counterfactual inference, but do not identify the mechanisms. This manuscript leverages the benefits of both approaches. We define the structural causal models in terms of the parameters and the equilibrium dynamics of the Markov process models, and counterfactual inference flows from these settings. The proposed approach alleviates the identifiability drawback of the structural causal models, in that the counterfactual inference is consistent with the counterfactual trajectories simulated from the Markov process model. We showcase the benefits of this framework in case studies of complex biomolecular systems with nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate that, in presence of Markov process model misspecification, counterfactual inference leverages prior data, and therefore estimates the outcome of an intervention more accurately than a direct simulation.",2019-11-06T03:01:45Z,2019-11-06T03:01:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02175v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02175v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, q-bio.MN, stat.AP"
Generalizable Resource Allocation in Stream Processing via Deep   Reinforcement Learning,"Xiang Ni, Jing Li, Mo Yu, Wang Zhou, Kun-Lung Wu","This paper considers the problem of resource allocation in stream processing, where continuous data flows must be processed in real time in a large distributed system. To maximize system throughput, the resource allocation strategy that partitions the computation tasks of a stream processing graph onto computing devices must simultaneously balance workload distribution and minimize communication. Since this problem of graph partitioning is known to be NP-complete yet crucial to practical streaming systems, many heuristic-based algorithms have been developed to find reasonably good solutions. In this paper, we present a graph-aware encoder-decoder framework to learn a generalizable resource allocation strategy that can properly distribute computation tasks of stream processing graphs unobserved from training data. We, for the first time, propose to leverage graph embedding to learn the structural information of the stream processing graphs. Jointly trained with the graph-aware decoder using deep reinforcement learning, our approach can effectively find optimized solutions for unseen graphs. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms both METIS, a state-of-the-art graph partitioning algorithm, and an LSTM-based encoder-decoder model, in about 70% of the test cases.",2019-11-19T19:25:42Z,2019-11-19T19:25:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08517v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08517v1,"cs.LG, cs.DC, eess.SP"

Namely, when the process hits the origin (the threshold $H$) it is either absorbed, with probability $\alpha$, or reflected upwards (downwards), with probability $1-\alpha$, for $0<\alpha<1$. We provide various results on the expected values of the renewal cycles and of the absorption time.

Each subprocess is considered a subtask. The segmentation is based on sequential action predictability using a parsimonious predictive model combined with the Shannon entropy.

In this work, we introduce one- and two-dimensional intensity-intensity correlation functions in terms of a new variable (e.g., probe pulse delay) and new perturbation parameter (e.g., probe pulse linewidth). In particular, diagonal projections are defined here as a tool to reduce both synchronous and asynchronous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy analyses down to one-dimensional analysis, revealing valuable analytical information. Detailed analyses using the all Gaussian coherent Raman scattering closed-form solutions and the representative experimental data for resonant and non-resonant processes are presented and compared.

Neural Network Gaussian Process Considering Input Uncertainty for   Composite Structures Assembly,"Cheolhei Lee, Jianguo Wu, Wenjia Wang, Xiaowei Yue","Developing machine learning enabled smart manufacturing is promising for composite structures assembly process. To improve production quality and efficiency of the assembly process, accurate predictive analysis on dimensional deviations and residual stress of the composite structures is required. The novel composite structures assembly involves two challenges: (i) the highly nonlinear and anisotropic properties of composite materials; and (ii) inevitable uncertainty in the assembly process. To overcome those problems, we propose a neural network Gaussian process model considering input uncertainty for composite structures assembly. Deep architecture of our model allows us to approximate a complex process better, and consideration of input uncertainty enables robust modeling with complete incorporation of the process uncertainty. Based on simulation and case study, the NNGPIU can outperform other benchmark methods when the response function is nonsmooth and nonlinear.

Generalized Stochastic Processes: Linear Relations to White Noise and   Orthogonal Representations,R. Carrizo Vergara,"We present two linear relations between an arbitrary (real tempered second order) generalized stochastic process over $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and White Noise processes over $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The first is that any generalized stochastic process can be obtained as a linear transformation of a White Noise. The second indicates that, under dimensional compatibility conditions, a generalized stochastic process can be linearly transformed into a White Noise. The arguments rely on the regularity theorem for tempered distributions, which is used to obtain a mean-square continuous stochastic process which is then expressed in a Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion with respect to a convenient Hilbert space. The first linear relation obtained allows also to conclude that any generalized stochastic process has an orthogonal representation as a series expansion of deterministic tempered distributions weighted by uncorrelated random variables with summable variances. This representation is then used to conclude the second linear relation.",2021-01-06T01:11:03Z,2021-11-03T12:46:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01839v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01839v2,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"

Here we propose an extended model where the self--effects are of both excitatory and inhibitory type and follow a Gaussian Process. Whereas previous work either relies on a less flexible parameterization of the model, or requires a large amount of data, our formulation allows for both a flexible model and learning when data are scarce. We continue the line of work of Bayesian inference for Hawkes processes, and our approach dispenses with the necessity of estimating a branching structure for the posterior, as we perform inference on an aggregated sum of Gaussian Processes. Efficient approximate Bayesian inference is achieved via data augmentation, and we describe a mean--field variational inference approach to learn the model parameters.

Under the condition that the jump times of the process $\nu$ do not accumulate over the considered time horizon, we show that the unnormalized filtering process is the unique solution to the Zakai equation, in the class of measure-valued processes having a square-integrable density.

The estimators are in turn used to develop strongly consistent goodness-of-fit hypothesis tests. In particular, we develop hypothesis tests to determine whether, under the same summability assumption, the $\alpha$-mixing (respectively $\beta$-mixing) coefficients of a process are upper bounded by a given rate function. Moreover, given a sample generated by a (not necessarily mixing) stationary ergodic process, we provide a consistent test to discern the null hypothesis that the $\ell_1$ norm of the sequence $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ of $\alpha$-mixing coefficients of the process is bounded by a given threshold $\gamma \in [0,\infty)$ from the alternative hypothesis that $\left\lVert \boldsymbol{\alpha} \right\rVert> \gamma$.

The Variance Gamma++ Process and Applications to Energy Markets,"M. Gardini, P. Sabino, E.

Such a process has the mathematical tractability of the Variance Gamma process and is obtained applying the self-decomposability of the gamma law. Compared to the Variance Gamma model, it has an additional parameter representing the measure of the trading activity. We give a full characterization of the Variance Gamma++ process in terms of its characteristic triplet, characteristic function and transition density. In addition, we provide efficient path simulation algorithms, both forward and backward in time. We also obtain an efficient ""integral-free"" explicit pricing formula for European options.

Compressibility Analysis of Asymptotically Mean Stationary Processes,Jorge F. Silva,"This work provides new results for the analysis of random sequences in terms of $\ell_p$-compressibility. The results characterize the degree in which a random sequence can be approximated by its best $k$-sparse version under different rates of significant coefficients (compressibility analysis). In particular, the notion of strong $\ell_p$-characterization is introduced to denote a random sequence that has a well-defined asymptotic limit (sample-wise) of its best $k$-term approximation error when a fixed rate of significant coefficients is considered (fixed-rate analysis). The main theorem of this work shows that the rich family of asymptotically mean stationary (AMS) processes has a strong $\ell_p$-characterization. Furthermore, we present results that characterize and analyze the $\ell_p$-approximation error function for this family of processes. Adding ergodicity in the analysis of AMS processes, we introduce a theorem demonstrating that the approximation error function is constant and determined in closed-form by the stationary mean of the process. Our results and analyses contribute to the theory and understanding of discrete-time sparse processes and, on the technical side, confirm how instrumental the point-wise ergodic theorem is to determine the compressibility expression of discrete-time processes even when stationarity and ergodicity assumptions are relaxed.",2021-07-08T17:06:21Z,2021-07-08T17:06:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03975v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03975v1,"stat.ME, math.PR, stat.AP"
Determinantal Point Processes in the Flat Limit,"Simon Barthelm√©, Nicolas Tremblay, Konstantin Usevich, Pierre-Olivier Amblard","Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are repulsive point processes where the interaction between points depends on the determinant of a positive-semi definite matrix.   In this paper, we study the limiting process of L-ensembles based on kernel matrices, when the kernel function becomes flat (so that every point interacts with every other point, in a sense). We show that these limiting processes are best described in the formalism of extended L-ensembles and partial projection DPPs, and the exact limit depends mostly on the smoothness of the kernel function. In some cases, the limiting process is even universal, meaning that it does not depend on specifics of the kernel function, but only on its degree of smoothness.   Since flat-limit DPPs are still repulsive processes, this implies that practically useful families of DPPs exist that do not require a spatial length-scale parameter.",2021-07-15T09:40:48Z,2022-05-31T09:03:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07213v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07213v2,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
A Study on Speech Enhancement Based on Diffusion Probabilistic Model,"Yen-Ju Lu, Yu Tsao, Shinji Watanabe","Diffusion probabilistic models have demonstrated an outstanding capability to model natural images and raw audio waveforms through a paired diffusion and reverse processes. The unique property of the reverse process (namely, eliminating non-target signals from the Gaussian noise and noisy signals) could be utilized to restore clean signals. Based on this property, we propose a diffusion probabilistic model-based speech enhancement (DiffuSE) model that aims to recover clean speech signals from noisy signals. The fundamental architecture of the proposed DiffuSE model is similar to that of DiffWave--a high-quality audio waveform generation model that has a relatively low computational cost and footprint. To attain better enhancement performance, we designed an advanced reverse process, termed the supportive reverse process, which adds noisy speech in each time-step to the predicted speech. The experimental results show that DiffuSE yields performance that is comparable to related audio generative models on the standardized Voice Bank corpus SE task. Moreover, relative to the generally suggested full sampling schedule, the proposed supportive reverse process especially improved the fast sampling, taking few steps to yield better enhancement results over the conventional full step inference process.",2021-07-25T19:23:18Z,2021-11-21T19:37:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11876v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11876v2,"eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD"
Process Discovery Using Graph Neural Networks,"Dominique Sommers, Vlado Menkovski, Dirk Fahland","Automatically discovering a process model from an event log is the prime problem in process mining. This task is so far approached as an unsupervised learning problem through graph synthesis algorithms. Algorithmic design decisions and heuristics allow for efficiently finding models in a reduced search space. However, design decisions and heuristics are derived from assumptions about how a given behavioral description - an event log - translates into a process model and were not learned from actual models which introduce biases in the solutions. In this paper, we explore the problem of supervised learning of a process discovery technique D. We introduce a technique for training an ML-based model D using graph convolutional neural networks; D translates a given input event log into a sound Petri net. We show that training D on synthetically generated pairs of input logs and output models allows D to translate previously unseen synthetic and several real-life event logs into sound, arbitrarily structured models of comparable accuracy and simplicity as existing state of the art techniques for discovering imperative process models.

Procedural Kernel Networks,Bartlomiej Wronski,"In the last decade Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have defined the state of the art for many low level image processing and restoration tasks such as denoising, demosaicking, upscaling, or inpainting. However, on-device mobile photography is still dominated by traditional image processing techniques, and uses mostly simple machine learning techniques or limits the neural network processing to producing low resolution masks. High computational and memory requirements of CNNs, limited processing power and thermal constraints of mobile devices, combined with large output image resolutions (typically 8--12 MPix) prevent their wider application. In this work, we introduce Procedural Kernel Networks (PKNs), a family of machine learning models which generate parameters of image filter kernels or other traditional algorithms. A lightweight CNN processes the input image at a lower resolution, which yields a significant speedup compared to other kernel-based machine learning methods and allows for new applications. The architecture is learned end-to-end and is especially well suited for a wide range of low-level image processing tasks, where it improves the performance of many traditional algorithms.

The effectiveness of this approach is closely related to the used method of decomposition. The paper presents the problem of decomposition process for the selected method of selective identification and localization of voltage fluctuation sources, in which the algorithm of enhanced empirical wavelet transform (EEWT) is used as the decomposition method.

Processing Network Controls via Deep Reinforcement Learning,Mark Gluzman,"Novel advanced policy gradient (APG) algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO), trust region policy optimization, and their variations, have become the dominant reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms because of their ease of implementation and good practical performance. This dissertation is concerned with theoretical justification and practical application of the APG algorithms for solving processing network control optimization problems. Processing network control problems are typically formulated as Markov decision process (MDP) or semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problems that have several unconventional for RL features: infinite state spaces, unbounded costs, long-run average cost objectives. Policy improvement bounds play a crucial role in the theoretical justification of the APG algorithms. In this thesis we refine existing bounds for MDPs with finite state spaces and prove novel policy improvement bounds for classes of MDPs and SMDPs used to model processing network operations. We consider two examples of processing network control problems and customize the PPO algorithm to solve them. First, we consider parallel-server and multiclass queueing networks controls. Second, we consider the drivers repositioning problem in a ride-hailing service system. For both examples the PPO algorithm with auxiliary modifications consistently generates control policies that outperform state-of-art heuristics.",2022-05-01T04:34:21Z,2022-05-01T04:34:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02119v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02119v1,"math.OC, cs.AI, cs.LG"

Existence of the processes, as well as some of their main properties, such as sample path regularity are derived. The model class in particular contains differentiable processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a differentiable Gaussian process on general compact metric graphs.

Despite this, there has been little exploration of the MC method for multivariate spatial point processes. Therefore, this article introduces a new MC method for parametric multivariate spatial point processes. A contrast function is computed based on the trace of the power of the difference between the conjectured $K$-function matrix and its nonparametric unbiased edge-corrected estimator.

The proposed methods are devised in full generality for the setting where the data of interest are themselves stochastic processes, and thus the proposed method can be used for pointing out the regions of maximum dissimilarity with a certain volume, in the contexts of functional data, time series, and point processes.

We thus provide a unified treatment and better connection between eigenvalue processes in different settings with the language of Riemannian geometry.

This behavior depends on the regularity (deterministic or nondeterministic) and on the dependence structure of the underlying observed process $X(t)$. In this paper we consider this problem both for deterministic and nondeterministic processes and survey some recent results. We focus on the less investigated case - deterministic processes. It turns out that for nondeterministic processes the asymptotic behavior of the prediction error is determined by the dependence structure of the observed process $X(t)$ and the differential properties of its spectral density $f$, while for deterministic processes it is determined by the geometric properties of the spectrum of $X(t)$ and singularities of its spectral density $f$.",2022-10-12T21:52:25Z,2022-10-12T21:52:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06603v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06603v1,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH, Primary: 60G10, 60G25, 62M15, 62M20.

Here we introduce the Dirac operator as a novel kind of shift operator for signal processing on complexes. We discuss how the Dirac operator has close relations but is distinct from the Hodge-Laplacian and examine its spectral properties.

Conditionally on the orbit process, satellites situated on these orbits are modeled as linear Poisson point processes, thereby forming a Cox point process. For this model, we derive useful statistics, including the distribution of the distance from the typical user to its nearest visible satellite, the outage probability, the Laplace functional of the proposed Cox satellite point process, and the Laplace transform of the interference power from the Cox-distributed satellites under general fading.

Neural Network Accelerated Process Design of Polycrystalline   Microstructures,"Junrong Lin, Mahmudul Hasan, Pinar Acar, Jose Blanchet, Vahid Tarokh","Computational experiments are exploited in finding a well-designed processing path to optimize material structures for desired properties. This requires understanding the interplay between the processing-(micro)structure-property linkages using a multi-scale approach that connects the macro-scale (process parameters) to meso (homogenized properties) and micro (crystallographic texture) scales. Due to the nature of the problem's multi-scale modeling setup, possible processing path choices could grow exponentially as the decision tree becomes deeper, and the traditional simulators' speed reaches a critical computational threshold. To lessen the computational burden for predicting microstructural evolution under given loading conditions, we develop a neural network (NN)-based method with physics-infused constraints. The NN aims to learn the evolution of microstructures under each elementary process. Our method is effective and robust in finding optimal processing paths. In this study, our NN-based method is applied to maximize the homogenized stiffness of a Copper microstructure, and it is found to be 686 times faster while achieving 0.053% error in the resulting homogenized stiffness compared to the traditional finite element simulator on a 10-process experiment.",2023-04-11T20:35:29Z,2023-05-03T04:07:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00003v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00003v2,"cs.CE, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG"
Replica-mean-field limit of continuous-time   fragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes,Michel Davydov,"Many phenomena can be modeled as network dynamics with punctuate interactions. However, most relevant dynamics do not allow for computational tractability. To circumvent this difficulty, the Poisson Hypothesis regime replaces interaction times between nodes by independent Poisson processes, allowing for tractability in several cases, such as intensity-based models from computational neuroscience. This hypothesis is usually only conjectured, or numerically validated. In this work, we introduce a class of processes in continuous time called continuous fragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes, by analogy with previously introduced processes in discrete time. The state of each node, described by the stochastic intensity of an associated point process, aggregates arrivals from its neighbors and is fragmented upon departure. We consider the replica-mean-field version of such a process, which is a physical system consisting of randomly interacting copies of the network of interest.

Quantum Fourier Transform for Image Processing,"Ze Yu Zhang, Weibo Gao","Quantum information processing and its subfield, quantum image processing, are rapidly growing fields as a result of advancements in the practicality of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other processing techniques. Finally, we present two novel schemes for transposing matrices in this paper. They use similar encoding rules but with deliberate choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection. The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.",2023-05-10T07:47:37Z,2024-10-16T03:21:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05953v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05953v2,"quant-ph, cs.DS, cs.ET"
Convex Quaternion Optimization for Signal Processing: Theory and   Applications,"Shuning Sun, Qiankun Diao, Dongpo Xu, Pauline Bourigault, Danilo P. Mandic","Convex optimization methods have been extensively used in the fields of communications and signal processing. However, the theory of quaternion optimization is currently not as fully developed and systematic as that of complex and real optimization. To this end, we establish an essential theory of convex quaternion optimization for signal processing based on the generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus. This is achieved in a way which conforms with traditional complex and real optimization theory. For rigorous, We present five discriminant theorems for convex quaternion functions, and four discriminant criteria for strongly convex quaternion functions. Furthermore, we provide a fundamental theorem for the optimality of convex quaternion optimization problems, and demonstrate its utility through three applications in quaternion signal processing. These results provide a solid theoretical foundation for convex quaternion optimization and open avenues for further developments in signal processing applications.",2023-05-09T16:11:17Z,2023-05-09T16:11:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06879v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06879v1,"math.OC, cs.LG, cs.NA, eess.SP, math.NA"
Tailoring Machine Learning for Process Mining,"Paolo Ceravolo, Sylvio Barbon Junior, Ernesto Damiani, Wil van der Aalst","Machine learning models are routinely integrated into process mining pipelines to carry out tasks like data transformation, noise reduction, anomaly detection, classification, and prediction. Often, the design of such models is based on some ad-hoc assumptions about the corresponding data distributions, which are not necessarily in accordance with the non-parametric distributions typically observed with process data. Moreover, the learning procedure they follow ignores the constraints concurrency imposes to process data. Data encoding is a key element to smooth the mismatch between these assumptions but its potential is poorly exploited. In this paper, we argue that a deeper insight into the issues raised by training machine learning models with process data is crucial to ground a sound integration of process mining and machine learning. Our analysis of such issues is aimed at laying the foundation for a methodology aimed at correctly aligning machine learning with process mining requirements and stimulating the research to elaborate in this direction.",2023-06-17T12:59:51Z,2023-06-17T12:59:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10341v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10341v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DB, 68, I.2.6"
Detecting Structural Shifts in Multivariate Hawkes Processes with   Fr√©chet Statistics,"Rui Luo, Vikram Krishnamurthy","This paper proposes a new approach for change point detection in multivariate Hawkes processes using Fr\'echet statistic of a network. The method splits the point process into overlapping windows, estimates kernel matrices in each window, and reconstructs the signed Laplacians by treating the kernel matrices as the adjacency matrices of the causal network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both simulated and cryptocurrency datasets. Our results show that our method is capable of accurately detecting and characterizing changes in the causal structure of multivariate Hawkes processes, and may have potential applications in fields such as finance and neuroscience. The proposed method is an extension of previous work on Fr\'echet statistics in point process settings and represents an important contribution to the field of change point detection in multivariate point processes.",2023-08-13T13:46:38Z,2025-01-22T08:24:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06769v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06769v3,"stat.ML, cs.SI, eess.SP"
Neutrinos and Heavy Element Nucleosynthesis,"Xilu Wang, Rebecca Surman","This chapter discusses three nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond the iron group that are influenced or shaped by neutrino interactions: the v process, the vp process and the r process. These processes are all related to explosive events involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, where an abundant amount of neutrinos are emitted. The interactions of the neutrinos with nucleons and nuclei through both charged-current and neutral-current reactions play a crucial role in the nucleosynthesis processes. During the propagation of neutrinos inside the nucleosynthesis sites, neutrinos may undergo flavor oscillations that can also potentially affect the nucleosynthesis yields.

Efficient Face Detection with Audio-Based Region Proposals for   Human-Robot Interactions,"William Aris, Fran√ßois Grondin","Efficient face detection is critical to provide natural human-robot interactions. However, computer vision tends to involve a large computational load due to the amount of data (i.e. pixels) that needs to be processed in a short amount of time. This is undesirable on robotics platforms where multiple processes need to run in parallel and where the processing power is limited by portability constraints. Existing solutions often involve reducing image quality which can negatively impact processing. The literature also reports methods to generate regions of interest in images from pixel data. Although it is a promising idea, these methods often involve heavy vision algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate how audio can be used to generate regions of interest in optical images to reduce the number of pixels to process with computer vision. Thereby, we propose a unique attention mechanism to localize a speech source and evaluate its impact on an existing face detection algorithm. Our results show that the attention mechanism reduces the computational load and offers an interesting trade-off between speed and accuracy. The proposed pipeline is flexible and can be easily adapted to other applications such as robot surveillance, video conferences or smart glasses.",2023-09-14T19:29:12Z,2024-03-15T20:21:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08005v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08005v2,"eess.AS, cs.SD, eess.IV"
MFRL-BI: Design of a Model-free Reinforcement Learning Process Control   Scheme by Using Bayesian Inference,"Yanrong Li, Juan Du, Wei Jiang","Design of process control scheme is critical for quality assurance to reduce variations in manufacturing systems. Taking semiconductor manufacturing as an example, extensive literature focuses on control optimization based on certain process models (usually linear models), which are obtained by experiments before a manufacturing process starts. However, in real applications, pre-defined models may not be accurate, especially for a complex manufacturing system. To tackle model inaccuracy, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) approach to conduct experiments and optimize control simultaneously according to real-time data. Specifically, we design a novel MFRL control scheme by updating the distribution of disturbances using Bayesian inference to reduce their large variations during manufacturing processes. As a result, the proposed MFRL controller is demonstrated to perform well in a nonlinear chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process when the process model is unknown. Theoretical properties are also guaranteed when disturbances are additive. The numerical studies also demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methodology.",2023-09-17T08:18:55Z,2023-09-17T08:18:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09205v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09205v1,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.ML"
Mixed orthogonality graphs for continuous-time state space models and   orthogonal projections,"Vicky Fasen-Hartmann, Lea Schenk","In this paper, we derive (local) orthogonality graphs for the popular continuous-time state space models, including in particular multivariate continuous-time ARMA (MCARMA) processes. In these (local) orthogonality graphs, vertices represent the components of the process, directed edges between the vertices indicate causal influences and undirected edges indicate contemporaneous correlations between the component processes. We present sufficient criteria for state space models to satisfy the assumptions of Fasen-Hartmann and Schenk (2024a) so that the (local) orthogonality graphs are well-defined and various Markov properties hold. Both directed and undirected edges in these graphs are characterised by orthogonal projections on well defined linear spaces. To compute these orthogonal projections, we use the unique controller canonical form of a state space model, which exists under mild assumptions, to recover the input process from the output process. We are then able to derive some alternative representations of the output process and its highest derivative. Finally, we apply these representations to calculate the necessary orthogonal projections, which culminate in the characterisations of the edges in the (local) orthogonality graph. These characterisations are given by the parameters of the controller canonical form and the covariance matrix of the driving L\'evy process.",2023-11-08T06:11:02Z,2024-08-13T12:38:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04478v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04478v2,"math.PR, Primary 62H22, 62M20, Secondary 62M10, 60G25, G.3"
Using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process to understand Denoising Diffusion   Probabilistic Model and its Noise Schedules,"Javier E. Santos, Yen Ting Lin","The aim of this short note is to show that Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model DDPM, a non-homogeneous discrete-time Markov process, can be represented by a time-homogeneous continuous-time Markov process observed at non-uniformly sampled discrete times. Surprisingly, this continuous-time Markov process is the well-known and well-studied Ornstein-Ohlenbeck (OU) process, which was developed in 1930's for studying Brownian particles in Harmonic potentials. We establish the formal equivalence between DDPM and the OU process using its analytical solution. We further demonstrate that the design problem of the noise scheduler for non-homogeneous DDPM is equivalent to designing observation times for the OU process. We present several heuristic designs for observation times based on principled quantities such as auto-variance and Fisher Information and connect them to ad hoc noise schedules for DDPM. Interestingly, we show that the Fisher-Information-motivated schedule corresponds exactly the cosine schedule, which was developed without any theoretical foundation but is the current state-of-the-art noise schedule.",2023-11-29T14:36:33Z,2023-11-29T14:36:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17673v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17673v1,"stat.ML, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.AI, cs.LG, math-ph, math.MP"
Classical Invasive Description of Informationally-Complete Quantum   Processes,"Moritz F. Richter, Andrea Smirne, Walter T. Strunz, Dario Egloff","In classical stochastic theory, the joint probability distributions of a stochastic process obey by definition the Kolmogorov consistency conditions. Interpreting such a process as a sequence of physical measurements with probabilistic outcomes, these conditions reflect that the measurements do not alter the state of the underlying physical system. Prominently, this assumption has to be abandoned in the context of quantum mechanics, yet there are also classical processes in which measurements influence the measured system. Here, we derive conditions that characterize uniquely classical processes that are probed by a reasonable class of invasive measurements. We then analyse under what circumstances such classical processes can simulate the statistics arising from quantum processes associated with informationally-complete measurements. We expect that our investigation will help build a bridge between two fundamental traits of non-classicality, namely, coherence and contextuality.",2023-12-11T17:31:32Z,2023-12-11T17:31:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06545v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06545v1,"quant-ph, physics.data-an, 81P16, 81P13, 81P40, 81S05, 62A01"

In this work, we show how to formulate fundamental notions of constructor theory within the canvas of process theory. Specifically, we exploit the functorial interplay between the symmetric monoidal structure of the category of sets and relations, where the abstract tasks live, and that of symmetric monoidal categories from physics, where concrete processes can be found to implement said tasks.

However, in the current state of play, Monte Carlo simulations of these processes are not straightforward for two main reasons: i) algorithms are available only for some specific processes within this class; ii) they are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a new simulation technique designed to address both challenges. It relies on the numerical inversion of the characteristic function, offering a general methodology applicable to all L\'evy-driven OU processes. Moreover, leveraging FFT, the proposed methodology ensures fast and accurate simulations, providing a solid basis for the widespread adoption of these processes in the energy sector. Lastly, the algorithm allows an optimal control of the numerical error. We apply the technique to the pricing of energy derivatives, comparing the results with the existing benchmarks.

This process aims to minimize a fidelity criterion, which is assessed against an unobserved task variable that is correlated with the analog signal. The scenario models various applications of interest such as channel estimation, medical imaging applications, and object localization. This work explores the integration of analog processing components -- such as analog delay elements, polynomial operators, and envelope detectors -- prior to ADC quantization. Specifically, four scenarios, involving different collections of analog processing operators are considered: (i) arbitrary polynomial operators with analog delay elements, (ii) limited-degree polynomial operators, excluding delay elements, (iii) sequences of envelope detectors, and (iv) a combination of analog delay elements and linear combiners. For each scenario, the minimum achievable distortion is quantified through derivation of computable expressions in various statistical settings.

The main focus of the article is the implication of hyperuniformity (reduced variance fluctuations in point processes) to optimal transport: in dimension $2$, we show that the typical matching cost has finite second moment under a mild logarithmic integrability condition on the reduced pair correlation measure, showing that most planar hyperuniform point processes are $ L^2$-perturbed lattices. Our method does not formally require assumptions on the correlation measure or the variance behaviour and it retrieves known sharp bounds for neutral integrable systems such as Poisson processes, and also applies to hyperfluctuating systems. The proof relies on the estimation of the optimal transport cost between point processes restricted to large windows for a well-chosen cost through their Fourier-Stieljes transforms, related to their structure factor.

In both cases, if no process can receive the message, it will still be sent. We establish a precise complexity class for two coverability problems with a parameterised number of processes: the state coverability problem and the configuration coverability problem. It is already known that these problems are Ackermann-hard (but decidable) in the general case.

Whilst simulating diffusion bridge processes is already difficult on Euclidean spaces, when considering diffusion processes on Riemannian manifolds the geometry brings in further complications. In even higher generality, advancing from Riemannian to sub-Riemannian geometries introduces hypoellipticity, and the possibility of finding appropriate explicit approximations for the score of the diffusion process is removed. We handle these challenges and construct a method for bridge simulation on sub-Riemannian manifolds by demonstrating how recent progress in machine learning can be modified to allow for training of score approximators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Since gradients dependent on the horizontal distribution, we generalise the usual notion of denoising loss to work with non-holonomic frames using a stochastic Taylor expansion, and we demonstrate the resulting scheme both explicitly on the Heisenberg group and more generally using adapted coordinates.

However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path"" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums, via equidistribution of horocycle lifts.",2024-06-08T17:02:35Z,2025-02-22T14:59:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05523v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05523v2,"math.PR, math.DS, math.GR, math.NT, math.RT"

We propose to jointly model the intensity and the cumulative intensity function as a transformed Gaussian process, allowing us to directly bypass the need of approximating the cumulative intensity function in the likelihood.

Attention Please: What Transformer Models Really Learn for Process   Prediction,"Martin K√§ppel, Lars Ackermann, Stefan Jablonski, Simon H√§rtl","Predictive process monitoring aims to support the execution of a process during runtime with various predictions about the further evolution of a process instance. In the last years a plethora of deep learning architectures have been established as state-of-the-art for different prediction targets, among others the transformer architecture. The transformer architecture is equipped with a powerful attention mechanism, assigning attention scores to each input part that allows to prioritize most relevant information leading to more accurate and contextual output. However, deep learning models largely represent a black box, i.e., their reasoning or decision-making process cannot be understood in detail. This paper examines whether the attention scores of a transformer based next-activity prediction model can serve as an explanation for its decision-making. We find that attention scores in next-activity prediction models can serve as explainers and exploit this fact in two proposed graph-based explanation approaches.

An Adaptive Importance Sampling for Locally Stable Point Processes,"Hee-Geon Kang, Sunggon Kim","The problem of finding the expected value of a statistic of a locally stable point process in a bounded region is addressed. We propose an adaptive importance sampling for solving the problem. In our proposal, we restrict the importance point process to the family of homogeneous Poisson point processes, which enables us to generate quickly independent samples of the importance point process. The optimal intensity of the importance point process is found by applying the cross-entropy minimization method. In the proposed scheme, the expected value of the function and the optimal intensity are iteratively estimated in an adaptive manner. We show that the proposed estimator converges to the target value almost surely, and prove the asymptotic normality of it. We explain how to apply the proposed scheme to the estimation of the intensity of a stationary pairwise interaction point process. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared numerically with the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and the perfect sampling.",2024-08-14T08:38:41Z,2024-08-14T08:38:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07372v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07372v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.CO"
Non-ergodic inference for stationary-increment harmonizable stable   processes,"Ly Viet Hoang, Evgeny Spodarev","We consider the class of stationary-increment harmonizable stable processes with infinite control measure, which most notably includes real harmonizable fractional stable motions. We give conditions for the integrability of the paths of such processes with respect to a finite, absolutely continuous measure and derive the distributional characteristics of the path integral with respect to said measure. The convolution of the path of a stationary-increment harmonizable stable process with a suitable measure yields a real stationary harmonizable stable process with finite control measure. This allows us to construct consistent estimators for the index of stability as well as the kernel function in the integral representation of a stationary increment harmonizable stable process (up to a constant factor). For real harmonizable fractional stable motions consistent estimators for the index of stability and its Hurst parameter are given. These are computed directly from the periodogram frequency estimates of the smoothed process.",2024-08-19T12:42:46Z,2024-08-19T12:42:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09950v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09950v1,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH"
Accelerating Point Cloud Ground Segmentation: From Mechanical to   Solid-State Lidars,"Xiao Zhang, Zhanhong Huang, Garcia Gonzalez Antony, Xinming Huang","In this study, we propose a novel parallel processing method for point cloud ground segmentation, aimed at the technology evolution from mechanical to solid-state Lidar (SSL). We first benchmark point-based, grid-based, and range image-based ground segmentation algorithms using the SemanticKITTI dataset. Our results indicate that the range image-based method offers superior performance and robustness, particularly in resilience to frame slicing. Implementing the proposed algorithm on an FPGA demonstrates significant improvements in processing speed and scalability of resource usage. Additionally, we develop a custom dataset using camera-SSL equipment on our test vehicle to validate the effectiveness of the parallel processing approach for SSL frames in real world, achieving processing rates up to 30.9 times faster than CPU implementations. These findings underscore the potential of parallel processing strategies to enhance Lidar technologies for advanced perception tasks in autonomous vehicles and robotics.

Discovery and Simulation of Data-Aware Business Processes,"Orlenys L√≥pez-Pintado, Serhii Murashko, Marlon Dumas","Simulation is a common approach to predict the effect of business process changes on quantitative performance. The starting point of Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a process model enriched with simulation parameters. To cope with the typically large parameter spaces of BPS models, several methods have been proposed to automatically discover BPS models from event logs. Virtually all these approaches neglect the data perspective of business processes. Yet, the data attributes manipulated by a business process often determine which activities are performed, how many times, and when. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a data-aware BPS modeling approach and a method to discover data-aware BPS models from event logs. The BPS modeling approach supports three types of data attributes (global, case-level, and event-level) as well as deterministic and stochastic attribute update rules and data-aware branching conditions. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method accurately discovers the type of each data attribute and its associated update rules, and that the resulting BPS models more closely replicate the process execution control flow relative to data-unaware BPS models.",2024-08-24T20:13:00Z,2024-08-24T20:13:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13666v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13666v1,"cs.SE, cs.LG, D.2.9; H.4.1"
Mechanistic Modeling of Continuous Lyophilization for Pharmaceutical   Manufacturing,"Prakitr Srisuma, George Barbastathis, Richard D. Braatz","Lyophilization (also known as freeze drying) is a process that is commonly used to increase the stability of drug products, e.g., mRNA vaccines, in pharmaceutical manufacturing. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shift the pharmaceutical industry towards continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article proposes the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which includes freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The state-of-the-art lyophilization technology is considered, in which vials are suspended and moved continuously through the process. The model can describe the evolution of several critical process parameters, namely the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire lyophilization process. The model is also demonstrated for several applications related to process design and optimization. Ultimately, the framework and results presented in this work can serve as a solid foundation to guide the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.",2024-09-10T06:44:51Z,2024-09-10T06:44:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06251v1,"cs.CE, physics.bio-ph, physics.chem-ph"
Stochastic Process Turing Machines,"David Wolpert, Jordan Scharnhorst","Computer science theory provides many different measures of complexity of a system including Kolmogorov complexity, logical depth, computational depth, and Levin complexity. However, these measures are all defined only for deterministic Turing machines, i.e., deterministic dynamics of the underlying generative process whose output we are interested in. Therefore, by construction they cannot capture complexity of the output of stochastic processes - like those in the real world. Motivated by this observation, we combine probabilistic Turing machines with a prior over the inputs to the Turing machine to define a complete stochastic process of Turing machines. We call this a stochastic process Turing machine. We use stochastic process Turing machines to define a set of new generative complexity measures based on Turing machines, which we call stochastic depth. As we discuss, stochastic depth is related to other such measures including Kolmogorov complexity and Levin complexity. However, as we elaborate, it has many desirable properties that those others measures lack. In addition, stochastic depth is closely related to various thermodynamic properties of computational systems. Stochastic process Turing machines and stochastic depth allow us to study complex, stochastic systems like the human brain, societies, and evolution all from within the framework of formal computation.",2024-10-09T17:52:27Z,2024-11-28T18:46:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07131v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07131v2,"cs.CC, cs.FL, cs.LO"

The considerable potential for Natural Language Processing in the legal sector, especially in developing computational tools for various legal processes, has captured the interest of researchers for years. This survey follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework, reviewing 148 studies, with a final selection of 127 after manual filtering. It explores foundational concepts related to Natural Language Processing in the legal domain, illustrating the unique aspects and challenges of processing legal texts, such as extensive document length, complex language, and limited open legal datasets. We provide an overview of Natural Language Processing tasks specific to legal text, such as Legal Document Summarization, legal Named Entity Recognition, Legal Question Answering, Legal Text Classification, and Legal Judgment Prediction. In the section on legal Language Models, we analyze both developed Language Models and approaches for adapting general Language Models to the legal domain.

Adaptive minimax estimation for discretely observed L√©vy processes,"C√©line Duval, Taher Jalal, Ester Mariucci","In this paper, we study the nonparametric estimation of the density $f_\Delta$ of an increment of a L\'evy process $X$ based on $n$ observations with a sampling rate $\Delta$. The class of L\'evy processes considered is broad, including both processes with a Gaussian component and pure jump processes. A key focus is on processes where $f_\Delta$ is smooth for all $\Delta$. We introduce a spectral estimator of $f_\Delta$ and derive both upper and lower bounds, showing that the estimator is minimax optimal in both low- and high-frequency regimes. Our results differ from existing work by offering weaker, easily verifiable assumptions and providing non-asymptotic results that explicitly depend on $\Delta$. In low-frequency settings, we recover parametric convergence rates, while in high-frequency settings, we identify two regimes based on whether the Gaussian or jump components dominate. The rates of convergence are closely tied to the jump activity, with continuity between the Gaussian case and more general jump processes. Additionally, we propose a fully data-driven estimator with proven simplicity and rapid implementation, supported by numerical experiments.",2024-10-31T23:17:06Z,2024-10-31T23:17:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00253v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00253v1,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH"
Point processes with event time uncertainty,"Xiuyuan Cheng, Tingnan Gong, Yao Xie","Point processes are widely used statistical models for uncovering the temporal patterns in dependent event data. In many applications, the event time cannot be observed exactly, calling for the incorporation of time uncertainty into the modeling of point process data. In this work, we introduce a framework to model time-uncertain point processes possibly on a network. We start by deriving the formulation in the continuous-time setting under a few assumptions motivated by application scenarios. After imposing a time grid, we obtain a discrete-time model that facilitates inference and can be computed by first-order optimization methods such as Gradient Descent or Variation inequality (VI) using batch-based Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The parameter recovery guarantee is proved for VI inference at an $O(1/k)$ convergence rate using $k$ SGD steps. Our framework handles non-stationary processes by modeling the inference kernel as a matrix (or tensor on a network) and it covers the stationary process, such as the classical Hawkes process, as a special case. We experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms previous General Linear model (GLM) baselines on simulated and real data and reveals meaningful causal relations on a Sepsis-associated Derangements dataset.",2024-11-05T00:46:09Z,2024-11-05T00:46:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02694v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02694v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH"
On the Weak Convergence of the Function-Indexed Sequential Empirical   Process and its Smoothed Analogue under Nonstationarity,"Florian Alexander Scholze, Ansgar Steland","We study the sequential empirical process indexed by general function classes and its smoothed set-indexed analogue. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity and weak convergence are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series, in terms of uniform moment bounds for partial sums and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, $L_p$-Lipschitz regularity. This yields comprehensive general results on the weak convergence of sequential empirical processes, which are applicable to various notions of dependence. Especially, we show that our moment conditions imply the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions (on the degree of dependence and the complexity of the indexing function class) as known for the classical empirical process. This is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing time series. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and suitable pathwise uniform Lipschitz properties.",2024-12-02T15:47:39Z,2024-12-02T15:47:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01635v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01635v1,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 60F17, 62L10, 62G30, 62M10"
Multi-Action Restless Bandits with Weakly Coupled Constraints:   Simultaneous Learning and Control,"Jing Fu, Bill Moran, Jos√© Ni√±o-Mora","We study a system with finitely many groups of multi-action bandit processes, each of which is a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action spaces and potentially different transition matrices when taking different actions. The bandit processes of the same group share the same state and action spaces and, given the same action that is taken, the same transition matrix. All the bandit processes across various groups are subject to multiple weakly coupled constraints over their state and action variables. Unlike the past studies that focused on the offline case, we consider the online case without assuming full knowledge of transition matrices and reward functions a priori and propose an effective scheme that enables simultaneous learning and control. We prove the convergence of the relevant processes in both the timeline and the number of the bandit processes, referred to as the convergence in the time and the magnitude dimensions. Moreover, we prove that the relevant processes converge exponentially fast in the magnitude dimension, leading to exponentially diminishing performance deviation between the proposed online algorithms and offline optimality.",2024-12-04T13:57:20Z,2024-12-04T13:57:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03326v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03326v1,"math.OC, cs.LG, math.PR, 90B36 (Primary) 90B15, 90B22 (Secondary)"

Under a natural assumption on $\phi$, we provide a characterization of such processes. Additionally, we emphasize the role of intrinsic repulsion in determinantal processes by comparing $\Lambda_\phi$ with the Poisson process of the same first intensity. As an application, we show that the determinantal process $\Lambda_\alpha$ associated to the canonical weight $\phi_\alpha(z)=|z|^\alpha$, $\alpha>0$, is almost surely separated if and only if $\alpha<4/3$.

In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures, which captures a broader class of process theories. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation that unifies and extends traditional process-theoretic approaches.

Relativistic diffusion processes and random walk models,"J√∂rn Dunkel, Peter Talkner, Peter H√§nggi","The nonrelativistic standard model for a continuous, one-parameter diffusion process in position space is the Wiener process. As well-known, the Gaussian transition probability density function (PDF) of this process is in conflict with special relativity, as it permits particles to propagate faster than the speed of light. A frequently considered alternative is provided by the telegraph equation, whose solutions avoid superluminal propagation speeds but suffer from singular (non-continuous) diffusion fronts on the light cone, which are unlikely to exist for massive particles. It is therefore advisable to explore other alternatives as well. In this paper, a generalized Wiener process is proposed that is continuous, avoids superluminal propagation, and reduces to the standard Wiener process in the non-relativistic limit. The corresponding relativistic diffusion propagator is obtained directly from the nonrelativistic Wiener propagator, by rewriting the latter in terms of an integral over actions. The resulting relativistic process is non-Markovian, in accordance with the known fact that nontrivial continuous, relativistic Markov processes in position space cannot exist. Hence, the proposed process defines a consistent relativistic diffusion model for massive particles and provides a viable alternative to the solutions of the telegraph equation.",2006-08-01T14:03:51Z,2007-01-19T09:08:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0608023v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0608023v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, astro-ph, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"
The Weaves Reconfigurable Programming Framework,Srinidhi Varadarajan,"This research proposes a language independent intra-process framework for object based composition of unmodified code modules. Intuitively, the two major programming models, threads and processes, can be considered as extremes along a sharing axis. Multiple threads through a process share all global state, whereas instances of a process (or independent processes) share no global state. Weaves provide the generalized framework that allows arbitrary (selective) sharing of state between multiple control flows through a process. The Weaves framework supports multiple independent components in a single process, with flexible state sharing and scheduling, all of which is achieved without requiring any modification to existing code bases. Furthermore, the framework allows dynamic instantiation of code modules and control flows through them. In effect, weaves create intra-process modules (similar to objects in OOP) from code written in any language. The Weaves paradigm allows objects to be arbitrarily shared, it is a true superset of both processes as well as threads, with code sharing and fast context switching time similar to threads. Weaves does not require any special support from either the language or application code, practically any code can be weaved. Weaves also include support for fast automatic checkpointing and recovery with no application support. This paper presents the elements of the Weaves framework and results from our implementation that works by reverse-analyzing source-code independent ELF object files.

Sensor Scheduling for Optimal Observability Using Estimation Entropy,Mohammad Rezaeian,"We consider sensor scheduling as the optimal observability problem for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This model fits to the cases where a Markov process is observed by a single sensor which needs to be dynamically adjusted or by a set of sensors which are selected one at a time in a way that maximizes the information acquisition from the process. Similar to conventional POMDP problems, in this model the control action is based on all past measurements; however here this action is not for the control of state process, which is autonomous, but it is for influencing the measurement of that process. This POMDP is a controlled version of the hidden Markov process, and we show that its optimal observability problem can be formulated as an average cost Markov decision process (MDP) scheduling problem. In this problem, a policy is a rule for selecting sensors or adjusting the measuring device based on the measurement history. Given a policy, we can evaluate the estimation entropy for the joint state-measurement processes which inversely measures the observability of state process for that policy. Considering estimation entropy as the cost of a policy, we show that the problem of finding optimal policy is equivalent to an average cost MDP scheduling problem where the cost function is the entropy function over the belief space. This allows the application of the policy iteration algorithm for finding the policy achieving minimum estimation entropy, thus optimum observability.",2006-09-29T11:38:53Z,2006-09-30T21:00:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0609157v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0609157v2,"cs.IT, cs.AI, math.IT, I.2.8; G.3; H.1.1"
Sampling Properties of the Spectrum and Coherency of Sequences of Action   Potentials,"M. R. Jarvis, P. P. Mitra","The spectrum and coherency are useful quantities for characterizing the temporal correlations and functional relations within and between point processes. This paper begins with a review of these quantities, their interpretation and how they may be estimated. A discussion of how to assess the statistical significance of features in these measures is included. In addition, new work is presented which builds on the framework established in the review section. This work investigates how the estimates and their error bars are modified by finite sample sizes. Finite sample corrections are derived based on a doubly stochastic inhomogeneous Poisson process model in which the rate functions are drawn from a low variance Gaussian process. It is found that, in contrast to continuous processes, the variance of the estimators cannot be reduced by smoothing beyond a scale which is set by the number of point events in the interval. Alternatively, the degrees of freedom of the estimators can be thought of as bounded from above by the expected number of point events in the interval. Further new work describing and illustrating a method for detecting the presence of a line in a point process spectrum is also presented, corresponding to the detection of a periodic modulation of the underlying rate. This work demonstrates that a known statistical test, applicable to continuous processes, applies, with little modification, to point process spectra, and is of utility in studying a point process driven by a continuous stimulus. While the material discussed is of general applicability to point processes attention will be confined to sequences of neuronal action potentials (spike trains) which were the motivation for this work.",2000-02-29T22:49:05Z,2000-02-29T22:49:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0002053v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0002053v1,"physics.bio-ph, physics.data-an, q-bio"
Bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on scale-free networks,"Andrea Baronchelli, Michele Catanzaro, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras","Reaction-diffusion processes can be adopted to model a large number of dynamics on complex networks, such as transport processes or epidemic outbreaks. In most cases, however, they have been studied from a fermionic perspective, in which each vertex can be occupied by at most one particle. While still useful, this approach suffers from some drawbacks, the most important probably being the difficulty to implement reactions involving more than two particles simultaneously. Here we introduce a general framework for the study of bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks, in which there is no restriction on the number of interacting particles that a vertex can host. We describe these processes theoretically by means of continuous time heterogeneous mean-field theory and divide them into two main classes: steady state and monotonously decaying processes. We analyze specific examples of both behaviors within the class of one-species process, comparing the results (whenever possible) with the corresponding fermionic counterparts. We find that the time evolution and critical properties of the particle density are independent of the fermionic or bosonic nature of the process, while differences exist in the functional form of the density of occupied vertices in a given degree class k. We implement a continuous time Monte Carlo algorithm, well suited for general bosonic simulations, which allow us to confirm the analytical predictions formulated within mean-field theory. Our results, both at the theoretical and numerical level, can be easily generalized to tackle more complex, multi-species, reaction-diffusion processes, and open a promising path for a general study and classification of this kind of dynamical systems on complex networks.",2008-02-22T17:16:59Z,2008-02-22T17:16:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3347v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3347v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.soc-ph, q-bio.PE"
"Stability for random measures, point processes and discrete semigroups","Youri Davydov, Ilya Molchanov, Sergei Zuyev","Discrete stability extends the classical notion of stability to random elements in discrete spaces by defining a scaling operation in a randomised way: an integer is transformed into the corresponding binomial distribution. Similarly defining the scaling operation as thinning of counting measures we characterise the corresponding discrete stability property of point processes. It is shown that these processes are exactly Cox (doubly stochastic Poisson) processes with strictly stable random intensity measures. We give spectral and LePage representations for general strictly stable random measures without assuming their independent scattering. As a consequence, spectral representations are obtained for the probability generating functional and void probabilities of discrete stable processes. An alternative cluster representation for such processes is also derived using the so-called Sibuya point processes, which constitute a new family of purely random point processes. The obtained results are then applied to explore stable random elements in discrete semigroups, where the scaling is defined by means of thinning of a point process on the basis of the semigroup. Particular examples include discrete stable vectors that generalise discrete stable random variables and the family of natural numbers with the multiplication operation, where the primes form the basis.",2009-07-01T08:05:58Z,2011-08-09T05:24:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0077v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.0077v3,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
A functional limit theorem for dependent sequences with infinite   variance stable limits,"Bojan Basrak, Danijel Krizmaniƒá, Johan Segers","Under an appropriate regular variation condition, the affinely normalized partial sums of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables converges weakly to a non-Gaussian stable random variable. A functional version of this is known to be true as well, the limit process being a stable L\'{e}vy process. The main result in the paper is that for a stationary, regularly varying sequence for which clusters of high-threshold excesses can be broken down into asymptotically independent blocks, the properly centered partial sum process still converges to a stable L\'{e}vy process. Due to clustering, the L\'{e}vy triple of the limit process can be different from the one in the independent case. The convergence takes place in the space of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions endowed with Skorohod's $M_1$ topology, the more usual $J_1$ topology being inappropriate as the partial sum processes may exhibit rapid successions of jumps within temporal clusters of large values, collapsing in the limit to a single jump. The result rests on a new limit theorem for point processes which is of independent interest. The theory is applied to moving average processes, squared GARCH(1,1) processes and stochastic volatility models.",2010-01-08T19:50:59Z,2012-10-11T08:32:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1345v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1345v2,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
A functional large and moderate deviation principle for infinitely   divisible processes driven by null-recurrent markov chains,Souvik Ghosh,"Suppose $ E$ is a space with a null-recurrent Markov kernel $ P$. Furthermore, suppose there are infinite particles with variable weights on $ E$ performing a random walk following $ P$. Let $ X_{t}$ be a weighted functional of the position of particles at time $ t$. Under some conditions on the initial distribution of the particles the process $ (X_{t})$ is stationary over time. Non-Gaussian infinitely divisible (ID) distributions turn out to be natural candidates for the initial distribution and then the process $ (X_{t})$ is ID. We prove a functional large and moderate deviation principle for the partial sums of the process $ (X_{t})$. The recurrence of the Markov Kernel $ P$ induces long memory in the process $ (X_{t})$ and that is reflected in the large deviation principle. It has been observed in certain short memory processes that the large deviation principle is very similar to that of an i.i.d. sequence. Whereas, if the process is long range dependent the large deviations change dramatically. We show that a similar phenomenon is observed for infinitely divisible processes driven by Markov chains. Processes of the form of $ (X_{t})$ gives us a rich class of non-Gaussian long memory models which may be useful in practice.",2010-10-20T20:22:21Z,2010-11-30T06:23:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4313v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4313v2,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 60F10, 60G57, 60G10, 60J05"
"Markov property of determinantal processes with extended sine, Airy, and   Bessel kernels","Makoto Katori, Hideki Tanemura","When the number of particles is finite, the noncolliding Brownian motion (the Dyson model) and the noncolliding squared Bessel process are determinantal diffusion processes for any deterministic initial configuration $\xi=\sum_{j \in \Lambda} \delta_{x_j}$, in the sense that any multitime correlation function is given by a determinant associated with the correlation kernel, which is specified by an entire function $\Phi$ having zeros in $\supp \xi$. Using such entire functions $\Phi$, we define new topologies called the $\Phi$-moderate topologies. Then we construct three infinite-dimensional determinantal processes, as the limits of sequences of determinantal diffusion processes with finite numbers of particles in the sense of finite dimensional distributions in the $\Phi$-moderate topologies, so that the probability distributions are continuous with respect to initial configurations $\xi$ with $\xi(\R)=\infty$. We show that our three infinite particle systems are versions of the determinantal processes with the extended sine, Bessel, and Airy kernels, respectively, which are reversible with respect to the determinantal point processes obtained in the bulk scaling limit and the soft-edge scaling limit of the eigenvalue distributions of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, and the hard-edge scaling limit of that of the chiral Gaussian unitary ensemble studied in the random matrix theory.

A unified formulation of Gaussian vs. sparse stochastic processes - Part   I: Continuous-domain theory,"Michael Unser, Pouya D. Tafti, Qiyu Sun","We introduce a general distributional framework that results in a unifying description and characterization of a rich variety of continuous-time stochastic processes. The cornerstone of our approach is an innovation model that is driven by some generalized white noise process, which may be Gaussian or not (e.g., Laplace, impulsive Poisson or alpha stable). This allows for a conceptual decoupling between the correlation properties of the process, which are imposed by the whitening operator L, and its sparsity pattern which is determined by the type of noise excitation. The latter is fully specified by a Levy measure. We show that the range of admissible innovation behavior varies between the purely Gaussian and super-sparse extremes. We prove that the corresponding generalized stochastic processes are well-defined mathematically provided that the (adjoint) inverse of the whitening operator satisfies some Lp bound for p>=1. We present a novel operator-based method that yields an explicit characterization of all Levy-driven processes that are solutions of constant-coefficient stochastic differential equations. When the underlying system is stable, we recover the family of stationary CARMA processes, including the Gaussian ones. The approach remains valid when the system is unstable and leads to the identification of potentially useful generalizations of the Levy processes, which are sparse and non-stationary. Finally, we show how we can apply finite difference operators to obtain a stationary characterization of these processes that is maximally decoupled and stable, irrespective of the location of the poles in the complex plane.",2011-08-31T07:57:58Z,2012-10-05T13:56:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.6150v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.6150v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, math.PR"
How Clustering Affects Epidemics in Random Networks,"Emilie Coupechoux, Marc Lelarge","Motivated by the analysis of social networks, we study a model of random networks that has both a given degree distribution and a tunable clustering coefficient. We consider two types of growth processes on these graphs: diffusion and symmetric threshold model. The diffusion process is inspired from epidemic models. It is characterized by an infection probability, each neighbor transmitting the epidemic independently. In the symmetric threshold process, the interactions are still local but the propagation rule is governed by a threshold (that might vary among the different nodes). An interesting example of symmetric threshold process is the contagion process, which is inspired by a simple coordination game played on the network. Both types of processes have been used to model spread of new ideas, technologies, viruses or worms and results have been obtained for random graphs with no clustering. In this paper, we are able to analyze the impact of clustering on the growth processes. While clustering inhibits the diffusion process, its impact for the contagion process is more subtle and depends on the connectivity of the graph: in a low connectivity regime, clustering also inhibits the contagion, while in a high connectivity regime, clustering favors the appearance of global cascades but reduces their size.   For both diffusion and symmetric threshold models, we characterize conditions under which global cascades are possible and compute their size explicitly, as a function of the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient. Our results are applied to regular or power-law graphs with exponential cutoff and shed new light on the impact of clustering.",2012-02-22T17:13:03Z,2012-02-22T17:13:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4974v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4974v1,"math.PR, cs.SI, physics.soc-ph, 60C05, 05C80, 91D30"
Hidden information and regularities of information dynamics III,Vladimir S. Lerner,"This presentation's Part 3 studies the evolutionary information processes and regularities of evolution dynamics, evaluated by an entropy functional (EF) of a random field (modeled by a diffusion information process) and an informational path functional (IPF) on trajectories of the related dynamic process (Lerner 2012). The integral information measure on the process' trajectories accumulates and encodes inner connections and dependencies between the information states, and contains more information than a sum of Shannon's entropies, which measures and encodes each process's states separately. Cutting off the process' measured information under action of impulse controls (Lerner 2012a), extracts and reveals hidden information, covering the states' correlations in a multi-dimensional random process, and implements the EF-IPF minimax variation principle (VP). The approach models an information observer (Lerner 2012b)-as an extractor of such information, which is able to convert the collected information of the random process in the information dynamic process and organize it in the hierarchical information network (IN), Part2 (Lerner, 2012c). The IN's highest level of the structural hierarchy, measured by a maximal quantity and quality of the accumulated cooperative information, evaluates the observer's intelligence level, associated with its ability to recognize and build such structure of a meaningful hidden information. The considered evolution of optimal extraction, assembling, cooperation, and organization of this information in the IN, satisfying the VP, creates the phenomena of an evolving observer's intelligence. The requirements of preserving the evolutionary hierarchy impose the restrictions that limit the observer's intelligence level in the IN. The cooperative information geometry, evolving under observations, limits the size and volumes of a particular observer.",2012-08-15T22:50:24Z,2012-08-15T22:50:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3241v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.3241v1,"nlin.AO, cs.IT, math.IT, 58J65, 60J65, 93B52, 93E02, 93E15, 93E30, H.1.1"
Exclusion processes on networks as models for cytoskeletal transport,"I. Neri, N. Kern, A. Parmeggiani","We present a study of exclusion processes on networks as models for complex transport phenomena and in particular for active transport of motor proteins along the cytoskeleton. We argue that active transport processes on networks spontaneously develop density heterogeneities at various scales. These heterogeneities can be regulated through a variety of multi-scale factors, such as the interplay of exclusion interactions, the non-equilibrium nature of the transport process and the network topology.   We show how an effective rate approach allows to develop an understanding of the stationary state of transport processes through complex networks from the phase diagram of one single segment. For exclusion processes we rationalize that the stationary state can be classified in three qualitatively different regimes: a homogeneous phase as well as inhomogeneous network and segment phases.   In particular, we present here a study of the stationary state on networks of three paradigmatic models from non-equilibrium statistical physics: the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process, the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with Langmuir kinetics. With these models we can interpolate between equilibrium (due to bi-directional motion along a network or infinite diffusion) and out-of-equilibrium active directed motion along a network. The study of these models sheds further light on the emergence of density heterogeneities in active phenomena.",2013-04-06T22:48:30Z,2013-04-06T22:48:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1943v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1943v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, nlin.CG, physics.bio-ph"
Are Deterministic Descriptions And Indeterministic Descriptions   Observationally Equivalent?,Charlotte Werndl,"The central question of this paper is: are deterministic and indeterministic descriptions observationally equivalent in the sense that they give the same predictions? I tackle this question for measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes, both of which are ubiquitous in science. I first show that for many measure-theoretic deterministic systems there is a stochastic process which is observationally equivalent to the deterministic system. Conversely, I show that for all stochastic processes there is a measure-theoretic deterministic system which is observationally equivalent to the stochastic process. Still, one might guess that the measure-theoretic deterministic systems which are observationally equivalent to stochastic processes used in science do not include any deterministic systems used in science. I argue that this is not so because deterministic systems used in science even give rise to Bernoulli processes. Despite this, one might guess that measure-theoretic deterministic systems used in science cannot give the same predictions at every observation level as stochastic processes used in science. By proving results in ergodic theory, I show that also this guess is misguided: there are several deterministic systems used in science which give the same predictions at every observation level as Markov processes. All these results show that measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes are observationally equivalent more often than one might perhaps expect. Furthermore, I criticise the claims of the previous philosophy papers Suppes (1993, 1999), Suppes and de Barros (1996) and Winnie (1998) on observational equivalence.",2013-10-06T18:49:39Z,2013-10-06T18:49:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1615v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.1615v1,"math.DS, nlin.CD, physics.class-ph, physics.hist-ph"
Additive monotones for resource theories of parallel-combinable   processes with discarding,"Brendan Fong, Hugo Nava-Kopp","A partitioned process theory, as defined by Coecke, Fritz, and Spekkens, is a symmetric monoidal category together with an all-object-including symmetric monoidal subcategory. We think of the morphisms of this category as processes, and the morphisms of the subcategory as those processes that are freely executable. Via a construction we refer to as parallel-combinable processes with discarding, we obtain from this data a partially ordered monoid on the set of processes, with f > g if one can use the free processes to construct g from f. The structure of this partial order can then be probed using additive monotones: order-preserving monoid homomorphisms with values in the real numbers under addition. We first characterise these additive monotones in terms of the corresponding partitioned process theory.   Given enough monotones, we might hope to be able to reconstruct the order on the monoid. If so, we say that we have a complete family of monotones. In general, however, when we require our monotones to be additive monotones, such families do not exist or are hard to compute. We show the existence of complete families of additive monotones for various partitioned process theories based on the category of finite sets, in order to shed light on the way such families can be constructed.",2015-05-06T19:02:24Z,2015-11-05T01:43:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02651v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02651v2,"cs.LO, cs.IT, math.IT, quant-ph"
Memory properties of transformations of linear processes,"Hailin Sang, Yongli Sang","In this paper, we study the memory properties of transformations of linear processes. Dittmann and Granger (2002) studied the polynomial transformations of Gaussian FARIMA(0,d,0) processes by applying the orthonormality of the Hermite polynomials under the measure for the standard normal distribution. Nevertheless, the orthogonality does not hold for transformations of non-Gaussian linear processes. Instead, we use the decomposition developed by Ho and Hsing (1996, 1997) to study the memory properties of nonlinear transformations of linear processes, which include the FARIMA(p,d,q) processes, and obtain consistent results as in the Gaussian case. In particular, for stationary processes, the transformations of short-memory time series still have short-memory and the transformation of long-memory time series may have different weaker memory parameters which depend on the power rank of the transformation. On the other hand, the memory properties of transformations of non-stationary time series may not depend on the power ranks of the transformations. This study has application in econometrics and financial data analysis when the time series observations have non-Gaussian heavy tails. As an example, the memory properties of call option processes at different strike prices are discussed in details.",2016-02-15T21:51:45Z,2016-05-05T18:30:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04850v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04850v2,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62M10, 62E20"
Compressive Estimation of a Stochastic Process with Unknown   Autocorrelation Function,"Mahdi Barzegar Khalilsarai, Saeid Haghighatshoar, Giuseppe Caire, Gerhard Wunder","In this paper, we study the prediction of a circularly symmetric zero-mean stationary Gaussian process from a window of observations consisting of finitely many samples. This is a prevalent problem in a wide range of applications in communication theory and signal processing. Due to stationarity, when the autocorrelation function or equivalently the power spectral density (PSD) of the process is available, the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) predictor is readily obtained. In particular, it is given by a linear operator that depends on autocorrelation of the process as well as the noise power in the observed samples. The prediction becomes, however, quite challenging when the PSD of the process is unknown. In this paper, we propose a blind predictor that does not require the a priori knowledge of the PSD of the process and compare its performance with that of an MMSE predictor that has a full knowledge of the PSD. To design such a blind predictor, we use the random spectral representation of a stationary Gaussian process. We apply the well-known atomic-norm minimization technique to the observed samples to obtain a discrete quantization of the underlying random spectrum, which we use to predict the process.

"A unified theory for exact stochastic modelling of univariate and   multivariate processes with continuous, mixed type, or discrete marginal   distributions and any correlation structure",Simon Michael Papalexiou,"Hydroclimatic processes are characterized by heterogeneous spatiotemporal correlation structures and marginal distributions that can be continuous, mixed-type, discrete or even binary. Simulating exactly such processes can greatly improve hydrological analysis and design. Yet this challenging task is accomplished often by ad hoc and approximate methodologies that are devised for specific variables and purposes. In this study, a single framework is proposed allowing the exact simulation of processes with any marginal and any correlation structure. We unify, extent, and improve of a general-purpose modelling strategy based on the assumption that any process can emerge by transforming a parent Gaussian process with a specific correlation structure. A novel mathematical representation of the parent-Gaussian scheme provides a consistent and fully general description that supersedes previous specific parameterizations, resulting in a simple, fast and efficient simulation procedure for every spatiotemporal process. In particular, introducing a simple but flexible procedure we obtain a parametric expression of the correlation transformation function, allowing to assess the correlation structure of the parent-Gaussian process that yields the prescribed correlation of the target process after marginal back transformation. The same framework is also applicable for cyclostationary and multivariate modelling. The simulation of a variety of hydroclimatic variables with very different correlation structures and marginals, such as precipitation, stream flow, wind speed, humidity, extreme events per year, etc., as well as a multivariate application, highlights the flexibility, advantages, and complete generality of the proposed methodology.",2017-07-21T11:11:03Z,2017-07-21T11:11:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06842v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06842v1,"stat.ME, math.ST, stat.AP, stat.TH"
Intuitive Analyses via Drift Theory,"Andreas G√∂bel, Timo K√∂tzing, Martin S.

While drift theory is used extensively by the community studying randomized search heuristics, it has seen hardly any applications outside of this field, in spite of many research questions that can be formulated as first-hitting times.   We state the most useful drift theorems and demonstrate their use for various randomized processes, including the coupon collector process, winning streaks, approximating vertex cover, and a random sorting algorithm. We also consider processes without expected stepwise change and give theorems based on drift theory applicable in such scenarios. We use these theorems for the analysis of the gambler's ruin process, for a coloring algorithm, for an algorithm for 2-SAT, and for a version of the Moran process without bias. A final tool we present is a tight theorem for processes on finite state spaces, which we apply to the Moran process.

Neural tuning size is a key factor underlying holistic face processing,"Cheston Tan, Tomaso Poggio","Faces are a class of visual stimuli with unique significance, for a variety of reasons. They are ubiquitous throughout the course of a person's life, and face recognition is crucial for daily social interaction. Faces are also unlike any other stimulus class in terms of certain physical stimulus characteristics. Furthermore, faces have been empirically found to elicit certain characteristic behavioral phenomena, which are widely held to be evidence of ""holistic"" processing of faces. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying such holistic face processing. In other words, for the processing of faces by the primate visual system, the input and output characteristics are relatively well known, but the internal neural computations are not. The main aim of this work is to further the fundamental understanding of what causes the visual processing of faces to be different from that of objects. In this computational modeling work, we show that a single factor - ""neural tuning size"" - is able to account for three key phenomena that are characteristic of face processing, namely the Composite Face Effect (CFE), Face Inversion Effect (FIE) and Whole-Part Effect (WPE). Our computational proof-of-principle provides specific neural tuning properties that correspond to the poorly-understood notion of holistic face processing, and connects these neural properties to psychophysical behavior. Overall, our work provides a unified and parsimonious theoretical account for the disparate empirical data on face-specific processing, deepening the fundamental understanding of face processing.",2014-06-15T03:05:07Z,2014-06-15T03:05:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3793v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3793v1,"cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.NE, q-bio.NC"

Existing techniques in this field are able to predict, at each step of a process instance, the likelihood that it will lead to an undesired outcome.These techniques, however, focus on generating predictions and do not prescribe when and how process workers should intervene to decrease the cost of undesired outcomes. This paper proposes a framework for prescriptive process monitoring, which extends predictive monitoring with the ability to generate alarms that trigger interventions to prevent an undesired outcome or mitigate its effect. The framework incorporates a parameterized cost model to assess the cost-benefit trade-off of generating alarms. We show how to optimize the generation of alarms given an event log of past process executions and a set of cost model parameters. The proposed approaches are empirically evaluated using a range of real-life event logs. The experimental results show that the net cost of undesired outcomes can be minimized by changing the threshold for generating alarms, as the process instance progresses. Moreover, introducing delays for triggering alarms, instead of triggering them as soon as the probability of an undesired outcome exceeds a threshold, leads to lower net costs.",2019-05-23T10:18:25Z,2020-10-14T12:33:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09568v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09568v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"

With this approach, some choices that are implicit in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting stand out, one example being choice of boundary conditions and more elaborate shape restrictions.   The paper first explores the Laplace operator and the Poisson equation and studies the corresponding Green's functions under various boundary conditions and constraints. Explicit functional forms are derived in a range of examples. These examples include several novel forms of the Green's function that, to the author's knowledge, have not previously been presented. Next we present a smoothing spline problem where we penalize the integrated squared derivative of the function to be estimated. We then show how the solution can be explicitly computed using the Green's function for the Laplace operator. In the last part of the paper, we explore the connection between Gaussian processes and differential equations, and show how the Laplace operator is related to Brownian processes and how processes that arise due to boundary conditions and shape constraints can be viewed as conditional Gaussian processes. The presented connection between Green's functions for the Laplace operator and covariance functions for Brownian processes allows us to introduce several new novel Brownian processes with specific behaviors.

Several models (languages) for processes' specification in order to facilitate their distributed execution, have been proposed. LSAWfP is among the most recent in this area: it helps to specify administrative processes with grammatical models indicating, in addition to their fundamental elements, the permissions (reading, writing and execution) of each actor in relation to each of their tasks. In this paper, we present a model for a completely decentralized and artifact-centric execution of administrative processes specified using LSAWfP. The presented model puts particular emphasis on actors' views: it then allows the confidential execution of certain tasks by ensuring that, each actor potentially has only a partial perception of the processes' global execution states. The model thus solves a very important problem in business process execution, which is often sidelined in existing approaches. To accomplish this, the model rely on three projection algorithms allowing to partially replicate the processes' global execution states at a given moment, to consistently update the obtained partial states and to deduce new coherent global states.

Stochastic geometry to generalize the Mondrian Process,"Eliza O'Reilly, Ngoc Tran","The stable under iterated tessellation (STIT) process is a stochastic process that produces a recursive partition of space with cut directions drawn independently from a distribution over the sphere. The case of random axis-aligned cuts is known as the Mondrian process. Random forests and Laplace kernel approximations built from the Mondrian process have led to efficient online learning methods and Bayesian optimization. In this work, we utilize tools from stochastic geometry to resolve some fundamental questions concerning STIT processes in machine learning. First, we show that a STIT process with cut directions drawn from a discrete distribution can be efficiently simulated by lifting to a higher dimensional axis-aligned Mondrian process. Second, we characterize all possible kernels that stationary STIT processes and their mixtures can approximate. We also give a uniform convergence rate for the approximation error of the STIT kernels to the targeted kernels, generalizing the work of [3] for the Mondrian case. Third, we obtain consistency results for STIT forests in density estimation and regression. Finally, we give a formula for the density estimator arising from an infinite STIT random forest. This allows for precise comparisons between the Mondrian forest, the Mondrian kernel and the Laplace kernel in density estimation.

For $\boldsymbol{y}, \boldsymbol{y}'\in \mathbb{Z}_+^d\times S_0$, consider the process $\{\boldsymbol{Y}_n\}_{n\ge 0}$ starting from the state $\boldsymbol{y}$ and let $\tilde{q}_{\boldsymbol{y},\boldsymbol{y}'}$ be the expected number of visits to the state $\boldsymbol{y}'$ before the process leaves the nonnegative area $\mathbb{Z}_+^d\times S_0$ for the first time. For $\boldsymbol{y}=(\boldsymbol{x},j)\in \mathbb{Z}_+^d\times S_0$, the measure $(\tilde{q}_{\boldsymbol{y},\boldsymbol{y}'}; \boldsymbol{y}'=(\boldsymbol{x}',j')\in \mathbb{Z}_+^d\times S_0)$ is called an occupation measure. Our primary aim is to obtain the asymptotic decay rate of the occupation measure as $\boldsymbol{x}'$ go to infinity in a given direction.

Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Continuous Time,Jonas Latz,"Stochastic gradient descent is an optimisation method that combines classical gradient descent with random subsampling within the target functional. In this work, we introduce the stochastic gradient process as a continuous-time representation of stochastic gradient descent. The stochastic gradient process is a dynamical system that is coupled with a continuous-time Markov process living on a finite state space. The dynamical system -- a gradient flow -- represents the gradient descent part, the process on the finite state space represents the random subsampling. Processes of this type are, for instance, used to model clonal populations in fluctuating environments. After introducing it, we study theoretical properties of the stochastic gradient process: We show that it converges weakly to the gradient flow with respect to the full target function, as the learning rate approaches zero. We give conditions under which the stochastic gradient process with constant learning rate is exponentially ergodic in the Wasserstein sense. Then we study the case, where the learning rate goes to zero sufficiently slowly and the single target functions are strongly convex. In this case, the process converges weakly to the point mass concentrated in the global minimum of the full target function; indicating consistency of the method. We conclude after a discussion of discretisation strategies for the stochastic gradient process and numerical experiments.",2020-04-15T16:04:41Z,2021-01-10T14:07:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07177v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07177v3,"math.PR, cs.LG, cs.NA, math.NA, stat.CO, 90C30, 60J25, 37A25, 65C40, 68W20"
Gaussian linear model selection in a dependent context,"Emmanuel Caron, J√©r√¥me Dedecker, Bertrand Michel","In this paper, we study the nonparametric linear model, when the error process is a dependent Gaussian process. We focus on the estimation of the mean vector via a model selection approach. We first give the general theoretical form of the penalty function, ensuring that the penalized estimator among a collection of models satisfies an oracle inequality. Then we derive a penalty shape involving the spectral radius of the covariance matrix of the errors, which can be chosen proportional to the dimension when the error process is stationary and short range dependent. However, this penalty can be too rough in some cases, in particular when the error process is long range dependent. In a second part, we focus on the fixed-design regression model assuming that the error process is a stationary Gaussian process. We propose a model selection procedure in order to estimate the mean function via piecewise polynomials on a regular partition, when the error process is either short range dependent, long range dependent or anti-persistent. We present different kinds of penalties, depending on the memory of the process. For each case, an adaptive estimator is built, and the rates of convergence are computed. Thanks to several sets of simulations, we study the performance of these different penalties for all types of errors (short memory, long memory and anti-persistent errors). Finally, we give an application of our method to the well-known Nile data, which clearly shows that the type of dependence of the error process must be taken into account.",2020-05-03T11:33:06Z,2020-05-03T11:33:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01058v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01058v1,"math.ST, stat.AP, stat.ME, stat.TH, 62G05, 62M10, 60G22"
A Framework for Plant Topology Extraction Using Process Mining and Alarm   Data,"Amir Neshastegaran, Ali Norouzifar, Iman Izadi","Industrial plants are prone to faults. To notify the operator of a fault occurrence, alarms are utilized as a basic part of modern computer-controlled plants. However, due to the interconnections of different parts of a plant, a single fault often propagates through the plant and triggers a (sometimes large) number of alarms. A graphical plant topology can help operators, process engineers and maintenance experts find the root cause of a plant upset or discover the propagation path of a fault. In this paper, a method is developed to extract plant topology form alarm data. The method is based on process mining, a collection of concepts and algorithms that model a process (not necessarily an engineering one) based on recorded events. The event based nature of alarm data as well as the chronological order of recorded alarms make them suitable for process mining. The methodology developed in this paper is based on preparing alarm data for process mining and then using the suitable process mining algorithms to extract plant topology. The extracted topology is represented by the familiar Petri net which can be used for root cause analysis and discovering fault propagation paths. The methods to evaluate the extracted topology are also discussed. A case study on the well-known Tennessee Eastman process demonstrates the utility of the proposed method.",2020-04-30T20:05:34Z,2020-04-30T20:05:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01615v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01615v1,"cs.DB, cs.SY, eess.SP, eess.SY"
Bayesian Optimization for Cascade-type Multi-stage Processes,"Shunya Kusakawa, Shion Takeno, Yu Inatsu, Kentaro Kutsukake, Shogo Iwazaki, Takashi Nakano, Toru Ujihara, Masayuki Karasuyama, Ichiro Takeuchi","Complex processes in science and engineering are often formulated as multistage decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider a type of multistage decision-making process called a cascade process. A cascade process is a multistage process in which the output of one stage is used as an input for the subsequent stage. When the cost of each stage is expensive, it is difficult to search for the optimal controllable parameters for each stage exhaustively. To address this problem, we formulate the optimization of the cascade process as an extension of the Bayesian optimization framework and propose two types of acquisition functions based on credible intervals and expected improvement. We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed acquisition functions and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments. In addition, we consider an extension called suspension setting in which we are allowed to suspend the cascade process at the middle of the multistage decision-making process that often arises in practical problems. We apply the proposed method in a test problem involving a solar cell simulator, which was the motivation for this study.",2021-11-16T10:01:08Z,2023-03-08T02:22:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08330v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08330v3,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.OC"
Noncommutative geometry and stochastic processes,Marco Frasca,"The recent analysis on noncommutative geometry, showing quantization of the volume for the Riemannian manifold entering the geometry, can support a view of quantum mechanics as arising by a stochastic process on it. A class of stochastic processes can be devised, arising as fractional powers of an ordinary Wiener process, that reproduce in a proper way a stochastic process on a noncommutative geometry. These processes are characterized by producing complex values and so, the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation resembles the Schroedinger equation. Indeed, by a direct numerical check, one can recover the kernel of the Schroedinger equation starting by an ordinary Brownian motion. This class of stochastic processes needs a Clifford algebra to exist. In four dimensions, the full set of Dirac matrices is needed and the corresponding stochastic process in a noncommutative geometry is easily recovered as is the Dirac equation in the Klein-Gordon form being it the Fokker--Planck equation of the process.",2014-12-15T17:46:21Z,2017-07-14T14:28:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4693v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4693v4,"quant-ph, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP"
Elliptic Bessel processes and elliptic Dyson models realized as   temporally inhomogeneous processes,Makoto Katori,"The Bessel process with parameter $D>1$ and the Dyson model of interacting Brownian motions with coupling constant $\beta >0$ are extended to the processes in which the drift term and the interaction terms are given by the logarithmic derivatives of Jacobi's theta functions. They are called the elliptic Bessel process, eBES$^{(D)}$, and the elliptic Dyson model, eDYS$^{(\beta)}$, respectively. Both are realized on the circumference of a circle $[0, 2 \pi r)$ with radius $r >0$ as temporally inhomogeneous processes defined in a finite time interval $[0, t_*), t_* < \infty$. Transformations of them to Schr\""odinger-type equations with time-dependent potentials lead us to proving that eBES$^{(D)}$ and eDYS$^{(\beta)}$ can be constructed as the time-dependent Girsanov transformations of Brownian motions. In the special cases where $D=3$ and $\beta=2$, observables of the processes are defined and the processes are represented for them using the Brownian paths winding round a circle and pinned at time $t_*$. We show that eDYS$^{(2)}$ has the determinantal martingale representation for any observable. Then it is proved that eDYS$^{(2)}$ is determinantal for all observables for any finite initial configuration without multiple points. Determinantal processes are stochastic integrable systems in the sense that all spatio-temporal correlation functions are given by determinants controlled by a single continuous function called the spatio-temporal correlation kernel.",2016-05-10T10:35:13Z,2016-09-22T06:49:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02931v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02931v2,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, nlin.SI"
Conjugate Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process Models for Efficient   Statistical Interpolation of Large Spatial Data,"Shinichiro Shirota, Andrew O. Finley, Bruce D. Cook, Sudipto Banerjee","A key challenge in spatial statistics is the analysis for massive spatially-referenced data sets. Such analyses often proceed from Gaussian process specifications that can produce rich and robust inference, but involve dense covariance matrices that lack computationally exploitable structures. The matrix computations required for fitting such models involve floating point operations in cubic order of the number of spatial locations and dynamic memory storage in quadratic order. Recent developments in spatial statistics offer a variety of massively scalable approaches. Bayesian inference and hierarchical models, in particular, have gained popularity due to their richness and flexibility in accommodating spatial processes. Our current contribution is to provide computationally efficient exact algorithms for spatial interpolation of massive data sets using scalable spatial processes. We combine low-rank Gaussian processes with efficient sparse approximations. Following recent work by [1], we model the low-rank process using a Gaussian predictive process (GPP) and the residual process as a sparsity-inducing nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP). A key contribution here is to implement these models using exact conjugate Bayesian modeling to avoid expensive iterative algorithms. Through the simulation studies, we evaluate performance of the proposed approach and the robustness of our models, especially for long range prediction.

Adversarial System Variant Approximation to Quantify Process Model   Generalization,"Julian Theis, Houshang Darabi","In process mining, process models are extracted from event logs using process discovery algorithms and are commonly assessed using multiple quality dimensions. While the metrics that measure the relationship of an extracted process model to its event log are well-studied, quantifying the level by which a process model can describe the unobserved behavior of its underlying system falls short in the literature. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based methodology called Adversarial System Variant Approximation (AVATAR) is proposed to overcome this issue. Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks are trained on the variants contained in an event log with the intention to approximate the underlying variant distribution of the system behavior. Unobserved realistic variants are sampled either directly from the Sequence Generative Adversarial Network or by leveraging the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The degree by which a process model relates to its underlying unknown system behavior is then quantified based on the realistic observed and estimated unobserved variants using established process model quality metrics. Significant performance improvements in revealing realistic unobserved variants are demonstrated in a controlled experiment on 15 ground truth systems. Additionally, the proposed methodology is experimentally tested and evaluated to quantify the generalization of 60 discovered process models with respect to their systems.",2020-03-26T22:06:18Z,2020-10-25T01:34:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12168v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12168v2,"cs.AI, cs.LG, I.2; H.1"
CONDA-PM -- A Systematic Review and Framework for Concept Drift Analysis   in Process Mining,"Ghada Elkhawaga, Mervat Abuelkheir, Sherif I. Barakat, Alaa M. Riad, Manfred Reichert","Business processes evolve over time to adapt to changing business environments. This requires continuous monitoring of business processes to gain insights into whether they conform to the intended design or deviate from it. The situation when a business process changes while being analysed is denoted as Concept Drift. Its analysis is concerned with studying how a business process changes, in terms of detecting and localising changes and studying the effects of the latter. Concept drift analysis is crucial to enable early detection and management of changes, that is, whether to promote a change to become part of an improved process, or to reject the change and make decisions to mitigate its effects. Despite its importance, there exists no comprehensive framework for analysing concept drift types, affected process perspectives, and granularity levels of a business process. This article proposes the CONcept Drift Analysis in Process Mining (CONDA-PM) framework describing phases and requirements of a concept drift analysis approach.

Thermodynamic uncertainty relation to assess biological processes,"Yonghyun Song, Changbong Hyeon","We review the trade-offs between speed, fluctuations, and thermodynamic cost involved with biological processes in nonequilibrium states, and discuss how optimal these processes are in light of the universal bound set by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). The values of the uncertainty product $\mathcal{Q}$ of TUR, which can be used as a measure of the precision of enzymatic processes realized for a given thermodynamic cost, are suboptimal when the substrate concentration $[S]$ is at the Michaelis constant ($K_\text{M}$), and some of the key biological processes are found to work around this condition. We illustrate the utility of $\mathcal{Q}$ in assessing how close the molecular motors and biomass producing machineries are to the TUR bound, and for the cases of biomass production (or biological copying processes) we discuss how their optimality quantified in terms of $\mathcal{Q}$ is balanced with the error rate in the information transfer process. We also touch upon the trade-offs in other error-minimizing processes in biology, such as gene regulation and chaperone-assisted protein folding.

We provide brief introductions to simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, with a special emphasis on the concepts needed for the processing of signals supported on these structures. Specifically, we discuss Fourier analysis, signal denoising, signal interpolation, node embeddings, and nonlinear processing through neural networks, using these two higher-order network models.

Gradient-descent quantum process tomography by learning Kraus operators,"Shahnawaz Ahmed, Fernando Quijandr√≠a, Anton Frisk Kockum","We perform quantum process tomography (QPT) for both discrete- and continuous-variable quantum systems by learning a process representation using Kraus operators. The Kraus form ensures that the reconstructed process is completely positive. To make the process trace-preserving, we use a constrained gradient-descent (GD) approach on the so-called Stiefel manifold during optimization to obtain the Kraus operators. Our ansatz uses a few Kraus operators to avoid direct estimation of large process matrices, e.g., the Choi matrix, for low-rank quantum processes. The GD-QPT matches the performance of both compressed-sensing (CS) and projected least-squares (PLS) QPT in benchmarks with two-qubit random processes, but shines by combining the best features of these two methods. Similar to CS (but unlike PLS), GD-QPT can reconstruct a process from just a small number of random measurements, and similar to PLS (but unlike CS) it also works for larger system sizes, up to at least five qubits. We envisage that the data-driven approach of GD-QPT can become a practical tool that greatly reduces the cost and computational effort for QPT in intermediate-scale quantum systems.",2022-08-01T12:48:48Z,2022-08-01T12:48:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00812v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00812v1,"quant-ph, cs.LG, physics.data-an"

A note on the random triadic process,"Fang Tian, Yiting Yang","For a fixed integer $r\geqslant 3$, let $\mathbb{H}_r(n,p)$ be a random $r$-uniform hypergraph on the vertex set $[n]$, where each $r$-set is an edge randomly and independently with probability $p$. The random $r$-generalized triadic process starts with a complete bipartite graph $K_{r-2,n-r+2}$ on the same vertex set, chooses two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ uniformly at random and iteratively adds $\{x,y\}$ as an edge if there is a subset $Z$ with size $r-2$, denoted as $Z=\{z_1,\cdots,z_{r-2}\}$, such that $\{x,z_i\}$ and $\{y,z_i\}$ for $1\leqslant i\leqslant r-2$ are already edges in the graph and $\{x,y, z_1,\cdots,z_{r-2}\}$ is an edge in $\mathbb{H}_r(n,p)$. The random triadic process is an abbreviation for the random $3$-generalized triadic process. Kor\'{a}ndi et al. proved a sharp threshold probability for the propagation of the random triadic process, that is, if $p= cn^{ - \frac 12}$ for some positive constant $c$, with high probability, the triadic process reaches the complete graph when $c> \frac 12$ and stops at $O(n^{\frac 32})$ edges when $c< \frac 12$. In this note, we consider the final size of the random $r$-generalized triadic process when $p=o( n^{- \frac 12}\log^{ \alpha(3-r)} n)$ with a constant $\alpha> \frac 12$. We show that the generated graph of the process essentially behaves like $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. The final number of added edges in the process, with high probability, equals $ \frac {1}{2}n^{2}p(1\pm o(1))$ provided that $p=\omega(n^{-2})$.

In this new context, fossil fuel-fired power plants must be coupled with a post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) process capable of highly transient operation. To tackle design and operational challenges simultaneously, we have developed a computational framework that integrates process design with techno-economic assessment. The backbone of this is a high-fidelity PCC mathematical model of a pressure-vacuum swing adsorption process. We demonstrate that the cost-optimal design has limited process flexibility, challenging reactiveness to disturbances, such as those in the flue gas feed conditions. The results illustrate that flexibility can be introduced by relaxing the CO$_2$ recovery constraint on the operation, albeit at the expense of the capture efficiency of the process. We discover that adsorption-based processes can accommodate for significant flexibility and improved performance with respect to the operational constraints on CO$_2$ recovery and purity.

This new field is called Mining Software Repositories (MSR). In spite of these efforts, there is limited work aiming to provide empirical evidence of learning processes directly from FLOSS repositories. In this paper, we seek to trigger such an initiative by proposing an approach based on Process Mining to trace learning behaviors from FLOSS participants trails of activities, as recorded in FLOSS repositories, and visualize them as process maps. Process maps provide a pictorial representation of real behavior as it is recorded in FLOSS data. Our aim is to provide critical evidence that boosts the understanding of learning behavior in FLOSS communities by analyzing the relevant repositories.

This raises the question: can these intrinsic models be shown theoretically to lead to better performance, compared to simply embedding all relevant quantities into $\mathbb{R}^d$ and using the restriction of an ordinary Euclidean Gaussian process? To study this, we prove optimal contraction rates for intrinsic Mat\'ern Gaussian processes defined on compact Riemannian manifolds. We also prove analogous rates for extrinsic processes using trace and extension theorems between manifold and ambient Sobolev spaces: somewhat surprisingly, the rates obtained turn out to coincide with those of the intrinsic processes, provided that their smoothness parameters are matched appropriately. We illustrate these rates empirically on a number of examples, which, mirroring prior work, show that intrinsic processes can achieve better performance in practice. Therefore, our work shows that finer-grained analyses are needed to distinguish between different levels of data-efficiency of geometric Gaussian processes, particularly in settings which involve small data set sizes and non-asymptotic behavior.",2023-09-19T20:30:58Z,2023-10-29T04:46:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10918v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10918v3,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH"
Anomaly Detection via Learning-Based Sequential Controlled Sensing,"Geethu Joseph, Chen Zhong, M. Cenk Gursoy, Senem Velipasalar, Pramod K. Varshney","In this paper, we address the problem of detecting anomalies among a given set of binary processes via learning-based controlled sensing. Each process is parameterized by a binary random variable indicating whether the process is anomalous. To identify the anomalies, the decision-making agent is allowed to observe a subset of the processes at each time instant. Also, probing each process has an associated cost. Our objective is to design a sequential selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time with the goal to minimize the delay in making the decision and the total sensing cost. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes. This formulation utilizes both a Bayesian log-likelihood ratio-based reward and an entropy-based reward. The problem is then solved using two approaches: 1) a deep reinforcement learning-based approach where we design both deep Q-learning and policy gradient actor-critic algorithms; and 2) a deep active inference-based approach. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and show that our algorithms adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes.",2023-11-30T07:49:33Z,2023-11-30T07:49:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00088v1,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SP, eess.SY"
Mining a Minimal Set of Behavioral Patterns using Incremental Evaluation,"Mehdi Acheli, Daniela Grigori, Matthias Weidlich","Process mining provides methods to analyse event logs generated by information systems during the execution of processes. It thereby supports the design, validation, and execution of processes in domains ranging from healthcare, through manufacturing, to e-commerce. To explore the regularities of flexible processes that show a large behavioral variability, it was suggested to mine recurrent behavioral patterns that jointly describe the underlying process. Existing approaches to behavioral pattern mining, however, suffer from two limitations. First, they show limited scalability as incremental computation is incorporated only in the generation of pattern candidates, but not in the evaluation of their quality. Second, process analysis based on mined patterns shows limited effectiveness due to an overwhelmingly large number of patterns obtained in practical application scenarios, many of which are redundant. In this paper, we address these limitations to facilitate the analysis of complex, flexible processes based on behavioral patterns. Specifically, we improve COBPAM, our initial behavioral pattern mining algorithm, by an incremental procedure to evaluate the quality of pattern candidates, optimizing thereby its efficiency. Targeting a more effective use of the resulting patterns, we further propose pruning strategies for redundant patterns and show how relations between the remaining patterns are extracted and visualized to provide process insights. Our experiments with diverse real-world datasets indicate a considerable reduction of the runtime needed for pattern mining, while a qualitative assessment highlights how relations between patterns guide the analysis of the underlying process.",2024-02-05T11:41:37Z,2024-02-05T11:41:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02921v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02921v1,"cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.LG"
Web-based Interactive Narratives to Present Business Processes Models,"M√°rcio Rocha Ferreira, Tadeu Moreira de Classe, Sean Wolfgand Matsui Siqueira","Interactive narratives offer a novel approach to presenting business process models, making them more accessible and collaborative. These narratives create a hyper-textual environment that facilitates knowledge exchange and comprehension for ordinary individuals. However, designing such narratives is complex, as business process modelers must accurately identify and translate the graphic elements of a process model into dynamic narrative elements. This research paper introduces the Scripting Your Process (SYP) method, which provides a systematic approach to designing interactive narratives based on business process models. Following the principles of Design Science Research (DSR), a quasi-experimental study demonstrates and evaluates the SYP method. The results show that the SYP method successfully achieves its objective, contributing to the systematic design of interactive narratives derived from business process models. Consequently, individuals who are not experts in business process management can understand these processes in an engaging and gameful manner.",2024-03-25T14:04:16Z,2024-03-25T14:04:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00049v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00049v1,"cs.HC, 68U35, H.4"
Random ReLU Neural Networks as Non-Gaussian Processes,"Rahul Parhi, Pakshal Bohra, Ayoub El Biari, Mehrsa Pourya, Michael Unser","We consider a large class of shallow neural networks with randomly initialized parameters and rectified linear unit activation functions. We prove that these random neural networks are well-defined non-Gaussian processes. As a by-product, we demonstrate that these networks are solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by impulsive white noise (combinations of random Dirac measures). These processes are parameterized by the law of the weights and biases as well as the density of activation thresholds in each bounded region of the input domain. We prove that these processes are isotropic and wide-sense self-similar with Hurst exponent 3/2. We also derive a remarkably simple closed-form expression for their autocovariance function. Our results are fundamentally different from prior work in that we consider a non-asymptotic viewpoint: The number of neurons in each bounded region of the input domain (i.e., the width) is itself a random variable with a Poisson law with mean proportional to the density parameter. Finally, we show that, under suitable hypotheses, as the expected width tends to infinity, these processes can converge in law not only to Gaussian processes, but also to non-Gaussian processes depending on the law of the weights. Our asymptotic results provide a new take on several classical results (wide networks converge to Gaussian processes) as well as some new ones (wide networks can converge to non-Gaussian processes).",2024-05-16T16:28:11Z,2025-02-12T15:34:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10229v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10229v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.PR"
Sparse Attention-driven Quality Prediction for Production Process   Optimization in Digital Twins,"Yanlei Yin, Lihua Wang, Dinh Thai Hoang, Wenbo Wang, Dusit Niyato","In the process industry, long-term and efficient optimization of production lines requires real-time monitoring and analysis of operational states to fine-tune production line parameters. However, complexity in operational logic and intricate coupling of production process parameters make it difficult to develop an accurate mathematical model for the entire process, thus hindering the deployment of efficient optimization mechanisms. In view of these difficulties, we propose to deploy a digital twin of the production line by encoding its operational logic in a data-driven approach. By iteratively mapping the real-world data reflecting equipment operation status and product quality indicators in the digital twin, we adopt a quality prediction model for production process based on self-attention-enabled temporal convolutional neural networks. This model enables the data-driven state evolution of the digital twin. The digital twin takes a role of aggregating the information of actual operating conditions and the results of quality-sensitive analysis, which facilitates the optimization of process production with virtual-reality evolution. Leveraging the digital twin as an information-flow carrier, we extract temporal features from key process indicators and establish a production process quality prediction model based on the proposed deep neural network. Our operation experiments on a specific tobacco shredding line demonstrate that the proposed digital twin-based production process optimization method fosters seamless integration between virtual and real production lines. This integration achieves an average operating status prediction accuracy of over 98% and a product quality acceptance rate of over 96%.",2024-05-20T09:28:23Z,2024-08-24T04:57:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11895v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11895v2,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language   Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?,"Kailas Dayanandan, Nikhil Kumar, Anand Sinha, Brejesh Lall","The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive processing and slower, logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ. We introduce an adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also aids in studying the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. The evidence underscores the importance of shape in identifying instances in human vision. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. Our study shows that segmentation models lack an understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to the position and number of sub-components. Additionally, the similarity in errors made by models and intuitive human processing indicates that models only address intuitive thinking in human vision. In contrast, multi-modal LLMs, including open-source models, demonstrate tremendous progress on errors made in intuitive processing. The models have improved performance on images that require logical reasoning and show recognition of sub-components. However, they have not matched the performance improvements made on errors in intuitive processing.",2024-06-11T05:50:34Z,2025-01-30T14:37:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06967v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06967v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI, eess.IV"
Asymptotic Uncertainty in the Estimation of Frequency Domain Causal   Effects for Linear Processes,"Nicolas-Domenic Reiter, Jonas Wahl, Gabriele C. Hegerl, Jakob Runge","Structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) processes are commonly used time series models to identify and quantify causal interactions between dynamically interacting processes from observational data. The causal relationships between these processes can be effectively represented by a finite directed process graph - a graph that connects two processes whenever there is a direct delayed or simultaneous effect between them. Recent research has introduced a framework for quantifying frequency domain causal effects along paths on the process graph. This framework allows to identify how the spectral density of one process is contributing to the spectral density of another. In the current work, we characterise the asymptotic distribution of causal effect and spectral contribution estimators in terms of algebraic relations dictated by the process graph. Based on the asymptotic distribution we construct approximate confidence intervals and Wald type hypothesis tests for the estimated effects and spectral contributions. Under the assumption of causal sufficiency, we consider the class of differentiable estimators for frequency domain causal quantities, and within this class we identify the asymptotically optimal estimator. We illustrate the frequency domain Wald tests and uncertainty approximation on synthetic data, and apply them to analyse the impact of the 10 to 11 year solar cycle on the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Our results confirm a significant effect of the solar cycle on the NAO at the 10 to 11 year time scale.",2024-06-26T09:12:18Z,2024-06-26T09:12:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18191v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18191v1,"stat.ME, math.ST, stat.TH"
Ternary Spike-based Neuromorphic Signal Processing System,"Shuai Wang, Dehao Zhang, Ammar Belatreche, Yichen Xiao, Hongyu Qing, Wenjie We, Malu Zhang, Yang Yang","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully implemented across various signal processing fields, resulting in significant enhancements in performance. However, DNNs generally require substantial computational resources, leading to significant economic costs and posing challenges for their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this study, we take advantage of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantization technologies to develop an energy-efficient and lightweight neuromorphic signal processing system. Our system is characterized by two principal innovations: a threshold-adaptive encoding (TAE) method and a quantized ternary SNN (QT-SNN). The TAE method can efficiently encode time-varying analog signals into sparse ternary spike trains, thereby reducing energy and memory demands for signal processing. QT-SNN, compatible with ternary spike trains from the TAE method, quantifies both membrane potentials and synaptic weights to reduce memory requirements while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two typical signal-processing tasks: speech and electroencephalogram recognition. The results demonstrate that our neuromorphic signal processing system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 94% reduced memory requirement. Furthermore, through theoretical energy consumption analysis, our system shows 7.5x energy saving compared to other SNN works.

Likelihood inference of the non-stationary Hawkes process with   non-exponential kernel,"Tsz-Kit Jeffrey Kwan, Feng Chen, William Dunsmuir","The Hawkes process is a popular point process model for event sequences that exhibit temporal clustering. The intensity process of a Hawkes process consists of two components, the baseline intensity and the accumulated excitation effect due to past events, with the latter specified via an excitation kernel. The classical Hawkes process assumes a constant baseline intensity and an exponential excitation kernel. This results in an intensity process that is Markovian, a fact that has been used extensively to establish the strong consistency and asymtpotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators or similar. However, these assumptions can be overly restrictive and unrealistic for modelling the many applications which require the baseline intensity to vary with time and the excitation kernel to have non-exponential decay. However, asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood inference for the parameters specifying the baseline intensity and the self-exciting decay under this setup are substantially more difficult since the resulting intensity process is non-Markovian. To overcome this challenge, we develop an approximation procedure to show the intensity process is asymptotically ergodic in a suitably defined sense. This allows for the identification of an ergodic limit to the likelihood function and its derivatives, as required for obtaining large sample inference under minimal regularity conditions.",2024-08-19T05:55:22Z,2024-08-19T05:55:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09710v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09710v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, Primary: 60G55.

Generating the Traces You Need: A Conditional Generative Model for   Process Mining Data,"Riccardo Graziosi, Massimiliano Ronzani, Andrei Buliga, Chiara Di Francescomarino, Francesco Folino, Chiara Ghidini, Francesca Meneghello, Luigi Pontieri","In recent years, trace generation has emerged as a significant challenge within the Process Mining community. Deep Learning (DL) models have demonstrated accuracy in reproducing the features of the selected processes. However, current DL generative models are limited in their ability to adapt the learned distributions to generate data samples based on specific conditions or attributes. This limitation is particularly significant because the ability to control the type of generated data can be beneficial in various contexts, enabling a focus on specific behaviours, exploration of infrequent patterns, or simulation of alternative 'what-if' scenarios. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a conditional model for process data generation based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Conditional models offer control over the generation process by tuning input conditional variables, enabling more targeted and controlled data generation. Unlike other domains, CVAE for process mining faces specific challenges due to the multiperspective nature of the data and the need to adhere to control-flow rules while ensuring data variability. Specifically, we focus on generating process executions conditioned on control flow and temporal features of the trace, allowing us to produce traces for specific, identified sub-processes. The generated traces are then evaluated using common metrics for generative model assessment, along with additional metrics to evaluate the quality of the conditional generation",2024-11-04T14:44:20Z,2024-11-04T14:44:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02131v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02131v1,"cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.LG"

From flip processes to dynamical systems on graphons,"Frederik Garbe, Jan Hladk√Ω, Matas ≈†ileikis, Fiona Skerman","We introduce a class of random graph processes, which we call flip processes. Each such process is given by a rule which is a function $\mathcal{R}:\mathcal{H}_k\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_k$ from all labeled $k$-vertex graphs into itself ($k$ is fixed). The process starts with a given $n$-vertex graph $G_0$. In each step, the graph $G_i$ is obtained by sampling $k$ random vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ of $G_{i-1}$ and replacing the induced graph $F:=G_{i-1}[v_1,\ldots,v_k]$ by $\mathcal{R}(F)$. This class contains several previously studied processes including the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph process and the triangle removal process. Actually, our definition of flip processes is more general, in that $\mathcal{R}(F)$ is a probability distribution on $\mathcal{H}_k$, thus allowing randomised replacements.   Given a flip process with a rule $\mathcal{R}$, we construct time-indexed trajectories $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_0\times [0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathcal{W}_0$ in the space of graphons. We prove that for any $T > 0$ starting with a large finite graph $G_0$ which is close to a graphon $W_0$ in the cut norm, with high probability the flip process will stay in a thin sausage around the trajectory $(\Phi(W_0,t))_{t=0}^T$ (after rescaling the time by the square of the order of the graph).   These graphon trajectories are then studied from the perspective of dynamical systems. Among others topics, we study continuity properties of these trajectories with respect to time and initial graphon, existence and stability of fixed points and speed of convergence (whenever the infinite time limit exists). We give an example of a flip process with a periodic trajectory.",2022-01-28T17:41:26Z,2024-11-28T10:54:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12272v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12272v5,"math.CO, math.PR, 05C80, F.2.2"

The IoT community has a strong focus on hardware, connectivity and data; the BPM community focuses mainly on finding, controlling, and enhancing the structured interactions among the IoT devices in processes. While the field of Process Mining deals with the extraction of process models and process analytics from process event logs, the data produced by IoT sensors often is at a lower granularity than these process-level events. The fundamental questions about extracting and abstracting process-related data from streams of IoT sensor values are: (1) Which sensor values can be clustered together as part of process events?, (2) Which sensor values signify the start and end of such events?, (3) Which sensor values are related but not essential? This work proposes a framework to semi-automatically perform a set of structured steps to convert low-level IoT sensor data into higher-level process events that are suitable for process mining. The framework is meant to provide a generic sequence of abstract steps to guide the event extraction, abstraction, and correlation, with variation points for plugging in specific analysis techniques and algorithms for each step. To assess the completeness of the framework, we present a set of challenges, how they can be tackled through the framework, and an example on how to instantiate the framework in a real-world demonstration from the field of smart manufacturing.

Towards Modeling of Consciousness,E. A. Novikov,An approach to nonlinear dynamical modeling of interaction between conscious and automatic processes in the brain is proposed.

SYMPLEX: Controllable Symbolic Music Generation using Simplex Diffusion   with Vocabulary Priors,"Nicolas Jonason, Luca Casini, Bob L. T. Sturm","We present a new approach for fast and controllable generation of symbolic music based on the simplex diffusion, which is essentially a diffusion process operating on probabilities rather than the signal space. This objective has been applied in domains such as natural language processing but here we apply it to generating 4-bar multi-instrument music loops using an orderless representation. We show that our model can be steered with vocabulary priors, which affords a considerable level control over the music generation process, for instance, infilling in time and pitch and choice of instrumentation -- all without task-specific model adaptation or applying extrinsic control.",2024-05-21T10:27:34Z,2024-05-21T10:27:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12666v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12666v1,"cs.SD, cs.LG, eess.AS"

Max-semistable extreme value laws for autoregressive processes with   Cantor-like marginals,Alef E. Sterk,This paper considers a family of autoregressive processes with marginal distributions resembling the Cantor function. It is shown that the marginal distribution is in the domain of attraction of a max-semistable distribution. The main result is that the extreme value law for the autoregressive process is obtained by including an extremal index in the law for an i.i.d.\ process with the same marginal distribution.

"Point processes in arbitrary dimension from fermionic gases, random   matrix theory, and number theory","Salvatore Torquato, A.

Here we analytically provide exact generalizations of such a point process in d-dimensional Euclidean space for any d, which are special cases of determinantal processes. In particular, we obtain the n-particle correlation functions for any n, which completely specify the point processes. We also demonstrate that spin-polarized fermionic systems have these same n-particle correlation functions in each dimension. The point processes for any d are shown to be hyperuniform. The latter result implies that the pair correlation function tends to unity for large pair distances with a decay rate that is controlled by the power law r^[-(d+1)]. We graphically display one- and two-dimensional realizations of the point processes in order to vividly reveal their ""repulsive"" nature. Indeed, we show that the point processes can be characterized by an effective ""hard-core"" diameter that grows like the square root of d. The nearest-neighbor distribution functions for these point processes are also evaluated and rigorously bounded. Among other results, this analysis reveals that the probability of finding a large spherical cavity of radius r in dimension d behaves like a Poisson point process but in dimension d+1 for large r and finite d. We also show that as d increases, the point process behaves effectively like a sphere packing with a coverage fraction of space that is no denser than 1/2^d.",2008-09-02T14:59:58Z,2008-11-25T16:49:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0449v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.0449v5,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"
Discovery through Gossip,"Bernhard Haeupler, Gopal Pandurangan, David Peleg, Rajmohan Rajaraman, Zhifeng Sun","We study randomized gossip-based processes in dynamic networks that are motivated by discovery processes in large-scale distributed networks like peer-to-peer or social networks.   A well-studied problem in peer-to-peer networks is the resource discovery problem. There, the goal for nodes (hosts with IP addresses) is to discover the IP addresses of all other hosts. In social networks, nodes (people) discover new nodes through exchanging contacts with their neighbors (friends). In both cases the discovery of new nodes changes the underlying network - new edges are added to the network - and the process continues in the changed network. Rigorously analyzing such dynamic (stochastic) processes with a continuously self-changing topology remains a challenging problem with obvious applications.   This paper studies and analyzes two natural gossip-based discovery processes. In the push process, each node repeatedly chooses two random neighbors and puts them in contact (i.e., ""pushes"" their mutual information to each other). In the pull discovery process, each node repeatedly requests or ""pulls"" a random contact from a random neighbor. Both processes are lightweight, local, and naturally robust due to their randomization.   Our main result is an almost-tight analysis of the time taken for these two randomized processes to converge. We show that in any undirected n-node graph both processes take O(n log^2 n) rounds to connect every node to all other nodes with high probability, whereas Omega(n log n) is a lower bound. In the directed case we give an O(n^2 log n) upper bound and an Omega(n^2) lower bound for strongly connected directed graphs. A key technical challenge that we overcome is the analysis of a randomized process that itself results in a constantly changing network which leads to complicated dependencies in every round.",2012-02-09T19:48:46Z,2012-02-09T19:48:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2092v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2092v1,"cs.DC, cs.DM, cs.DS"
Block-Online Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement Using DNN-Supported   Relative Transfer Function Estimates,"Jiri Malek, Zbynek Koldovsky, Marek Bohac","This work addresses the problem of block-online processing for multi-channel speech enhancement. Such processing is vital in scenarios with moving speakers and/or when very short utterances are processed, e.g., in voice assistant scenarios. We consider several variants of a system that performs beamforming supported by DNN-based voice activity detection (VAD) followed by post-filtering. The speaker is targeted through estimating relative transfer functions between microphones. Each block of the input signals is processed independently in order to make the method applicable in highly dynamic environments. Owing to the short length of the processed block, the statistics required by the beamformer are estimated less precisely. The influence of this inaccuracy is studied and compared to the processing regime when recordings are treated as one block (batch processing). The experimental evaluation of the proposed method is performed on large datasets of CHiME-4 and on another dataset featuring moving target speaker. The experiments are evaluated in terms of objective and perceptual criteria (such as signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) or perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), respectively). Moreover, word error rate (WER) achieved by a baseline automatic speech recognition system is evaluated, for which the enhancement method serves as a front-end solution. The results indicate that the proposed method is robust with respect to short length of the processed block. Significant improvements in terms of the criteria and WER are observed even for the block length of 250 ms.",2019-05-09T13:47:30Z,2019-12-11T15:35:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03632v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03632v3,"cs.SD, cs.SY, eess.AS"
Infinitely Wide Tensor Networks as Gaussian Process,"Erdong Guo, David Draper","Gaussian Process is a non-parametric prior which can be understood as a distribution on the function space intuitively. It is known that by introducing appropriate prior to the weights of the neural networks, Gaussian Process can be obtained by taking the infinite-width limit of the Bayesian neural networks from a Bayesian perspective. In this paper, we explore the infinitely wide Tensor Networks and show the equivalence of the infinitely wide Tensor Networks and the Gaussian Process. We study the pure Tensor Network and another two extended Tensor Network structures: Neural Kernel Tensor Network and Tensor Network hidden layer Neural Network and prove that each one will converge to the Gaussian Process as the width of each model goes to infinity. (We note here that Gaussian Process can also be obtained by taking the infinite limit of at least one of the bond dimensions $\alpha_{i}$ in the product of tensor nodes, and the proofs can be done with the same ideas in the proofs of the infinite-width cases.) We calculate the mean function (mean vector) and the covariance function (covariance matrix) of the finite dimensional distribution of the induced Gaussian Process by the infinite-width tensor network with a general set-up. We study the properties of the covariance function and derive the approximation of the covariance function when the integral in the expectation operator is intractable. In the numerical experiments, we implement the Gaussian Process corresponding to the infinite limit tensor networks and plot the sample paths of these models. We study the hyperparameters and plot the sample path families in the induced Gaussian Process by varying the standard deviations of the prior distributions. As expected, the parameters in the prior distribution namely the hyper-parameters in the induced Gaussian Process controls the characteristic lengthscales of the Gaussian Process.",2021-01-07T02:29:15Z,2021-01-07T02:29:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02333v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02333v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, cs.NE"
Interval-censored Hawkes processes,"Marian-Andrei Rizoiu, Alexander Soen, Shidi Li, Pio Calderon, Leanne Dong, Aditya Krishna Menon, Lexing Xie","Interval-censored data solely records the aggregated counts of events during specific time intervals - such as the number of patients admitted to the hospital or the volume of vehicles passing traffic loop detectors - and not the exact occurrence time of the events. It is currently not understood how to fit the Hawkes point processes to this kind of data. Its typical loss function (the point process log-likelihood) cannot be computed without exact event times. Furthermore, it does not have the independent increments property to use the Poisson likelihood. This work builds a novel point process, a set of tools, and approximations for fitting Hawkes processes within interval-censored data scenarios. First, we define the Mean Behavior Poisson process (MBPP), a novel Poisson process with a direct parameter correspondence to the popular self-exciting Hawkes process. We fit MBPP in the interval-censored setting using an interval-censored Poisson log-likelihood (IC-LL). We use the parameter equivalence to uncover the parameters of the associated Hawkes process. Second, we introduce two novel exogenous functions to distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous events. We propose the multi-impulse exogenous function - for when the exogenous events are observed as event time - and the latent homogeneous Poisson process exogenous function - for when the exogenous events are presented as interval-censored volumes. Third, we provide several approximation methods to estimate the intensity and compensator function of MBPP when no analytical solution exists. Fourth and finally, we connect the interval-censored loss of MBPP to a broader class of Bregman divergence-based functions. Using the connection, we show that the popularity estimation algorithm Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP) is a particular case of the MBPP. We verify our models through empirical testing on synthetic data and real-world data.",2021-04-16T07:29:04Z,2022-11-26T04:06:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07932v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07932v4,"cs.LG, cs.CE, stat.ML"
Siegmund duality for physicists: a bridge between spatial and   first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes,"Mathis Gu√©neau, L√©o Touzo","We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. This is known as Siegmund duality in mathematics. Here we show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.",2024-04-16T13:06:38Z,2024-11-01T13:19:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10537v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP, math.PR"
On Learning what to Learn: heterogeneous observations of dynamics and   establishing (possibly causal) relations among them,"David W. Sroczynski, Felix Dietrich, Eleni D. Koronaki, Ronen Talmon, Ronald R. Coifman, Erik Bollt, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis","Before we attempt to learn a function between two (sets of) observables of a physical process, we must first decide what the inputs and what the outputs of the desired function are going to be. Here we demonstrate two distinct, data-driven ways of initially deciding ``the right quantities'' to relate through such a function, and then proceed to learn it. This is accomplished by processing multiple simultaneous heterogeneous data streams (ensembles of time series) from observations of a physical system: multiple observation processes of the system. We thus determine (a) what subsets of observables are common between the observation processes (and therefore observable from each other, relatable through a function); and (b) what information is unrelated to these common observables, and therefore particular to each observation process, and not contributing to the desired function. Any data-driven function approximation technique can subsequently be used to learn the input-output relation, from k-nearest neighbors and Geometric Harmonics to Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks. Two particular ``twists'' of the approach are discussed. The first has to do with the identifiability of particular quantities of interest from the measurements. We now construct mappings from a single set of observations of one process to entire level sets of measurements of the process, consistent with this single set.

Noncolliding Brownian Motion and Determinantal Processes,"Makoto Katori, Hideki Tanemura","A system of one-dimensional Brownian motions (BMs) conditioned never to collide with each other is realized as (i) Dyson's BM model, which is a process of eigenvalues of hermitian matrix-valued diffusion process in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), and as (ii) the $h$-transform of absorbing BM in a Weyl chamber, where the harmonic function $h$ is the product of differences of variables (the Vandermonde determinant). The Karlin-McGregor formula gives determinantal expression to the transition probability density of absorbing BM. We show from the Karlin-McGregor formula, if the initial state is in the eigenvalue distribution of GUE, the noncolliding BM is a determinantal process, in the sense that any multitime correlation function is given by a determinant specified by a matrix-kernel. By taking appropriate scaling limits, spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous infinite determinantal processes are derived. We note that the determinantal processes related with noncolliding particle systems have a feature in common such that the matrix-kernels are expressed using spectral projections of appropriate effective Hamiltonians. On the common structure of matrix-kernels, continuity of processes in time is proved and general property of the determinantal processes is discussed.",2007-05-17T00:48:36Z,2007-11-12T01:24:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2460v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.2460v3,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, nlin.SI"

Asymptotic Properties of an Estimator of the Drift Coefficients of   Multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes that are not Necessarily Stable,"Gopal K. Basak, Philip Lee","In this paper, we investigate the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of an estimator of the drift matrix, $F$, of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes that are not necessarily stable. We consider all the cases. (1) The eigenvalues of $F$ are in the right half space (i.e., eigenvalues with positive real parts). In this case the process grows exponentially fast. (2) The eigenvalues of $F$ are on the left half space (i.e., the eigenvalues with negative or zero real parts). The process where all eigenvalues of $F$ have negative real parts is called a stable process and has a unique invariant (i.e., stationary) distribution. In this case the process does not grow. When the eigenvalues of $F$ have zero real parts (i.e., the case of zero eigenvalues and purely imaginary eigenvalues) the process grows polynomially fast. Considering (1) and (2) separately, we first show that an estimator, $\hat{F}$, of $F$ is consistent. We then combine them to present results for the general Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We adopt similar procedure to show the asymptotic efficiency of the estimator.",2008-05-29T13:09:21Z,2008-09-03T09:49:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.4535v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.4535v2,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.ME, stat.TH, 62M05, 60F15"
Self-similarity parameter estimation and reproduction property for   non-Gaussian Hermite processes,"Alexandra Chronopoulou, Frederi Viens, Ciprian Tudor","We consider the class of all the Hermite processes $(Z_{t}^{(q,H)})_{t\in \lbrack 0,1]}$ of order $q\in \mathbf{N}^{\ast}$ and with Hurst parameter $% H\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. The process $Z^{(q,H)}$ is $H$-selfsimilar, it has stationary increments and it exhibits long-range dependence identical to that of fractional Brownian motion (fBm). For $q=1$, $Z^{(1,H)}$ is fBm, which is Gaussian; for $q=2$, $Z^{(2,H)}$ is the Rosenblatt process, which lives in the second Wiener chaos; for any $q>2$, $Z^{(q,H)}$ is a process in the $q$th Wiener chaos. We study the variations of $Z^{(q,H)}$ for any $q$, by using multiple Wiener -It\^{o} stochastic integrals and Malliavin calculus. We prove a reproduction property for this class of processes in the sense that the terms appearing in the chaotic decomposition of their variations give rise to other Hermite processes of different orders and with different Hurst parameters. We apply our results to construct a strongly consistent estimator for the self-similarity parameter $H$ from discrete observations of $Z^{(q,H)}$; the asymptotics of this estimator, after appropriate normalization, are proved to be distributed like a Rosenblatt random variable (value at time $1$ of a Rosenblatt process).with self-similarity parameter $1+2(H-1)/q$.",2008-07-08T10:11:45Z,2010-06-18T11:22:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1208v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.1208v2,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"

The TASEP speed process,"Gideon Amir, Omer Angel, Benedek Valk√≥","In the multi-type totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on the line, each site of Z is occupied by a particle labeled with some number, and two neighboring particles are interchanged at rate one if their labels are in increasing order. Consider the process with the initial configuration where each particle is labeled by its position. It is known that in this case a.s. each particle has an asymptotic speed which is distributed uniformly on [-1,1]. We study the joint distribution of these speeds: the TASEP speed process. We prove that the TASEP speed process is stationary with respect to the multi-type TASEP dynamics. Consequently, every ergodic stationary measure is given as a projection of the speed process measure. This generalizes previous descriptions restricted to finitely many classes. By combining this result with known stationary measures for TASEPs with finitely many types, we compute several marginals of the speed process, including the joint density of two and three consecutive speeds. One striking property of the distribution is that two speeds are equal with positive probability and for any given particle there are infinitely many others with the same speed. We also study the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). We prove that the states of the ASEP with the above initial configuration, seen as permutations of Z, are symmetric in distribution. This allows us to extend some of our results, including the stationarity and description of all ergodic stationary measures, also to the ASEP.",2008-11-23T01:59:23Z,2012-11-15T08:40:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3706v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3706v2,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP"

Stochastic lattice gas model describing the dynamics of an epidemic,"David R. de Souza, T√¢nia Tom√©","We study a stochastic process describing the onset of spreading dynamics of an epidemic in a population composed by individuals of three classes: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). The stochastic process is defined by local rules and involves the following cyclic process: S$\to$I$\to$R$\to$S (SIRS). The open process S$\to$I$\to$R (SIR) is studied as a particular case of the SIRS process. The epidemic process is analyzed at different levels of description: by a stochastic lattice gas model and by a birth and death process. By means of Monte Carlo simulations and dynamical mean-field approximations we show that the SIRS stochastic lattice gas model exhibit a line of critical points separating two phases: an absorbing phase where the lattice is completely full of S individuals and an active phase where S, I and R individuals coexist, which may or may not present population cycles. The critical line, that corresponds to the onset of epidemic spreading, is shown to belong in the directed percolation universality class.

Process Algebra as Abstract Data Types,"Ruqian Lu, Lixing Li, Yun Shang, Xiaoyu Li","In this paper we introduced an algebraic semantics for process algebra in form of abstract data types. For that purpose, we developed a particular type of algebra, the seed algebra, which describes exactly the behavior of a process within a labeled transition system. We have shown the possibility of characterizing the bisimulation of two processes with the isomorphism of their corresponding seed algebras. We pointed out that the traditional concept of isomorphism of algebra does not apply here, because there is even no one-one correspondence between the elements of two seed algebras. The lack of this one-one correspondence comes from the non-deterministic choice of transitions of a process. We introduce a technique of hidden operations to mask unwanted details of elements of a seed algebra, which only reflect non-determinism or other implicit control mechanism of process transition. Elements of a seed algebra are considered as indistinguishable if they show the same behavior after these unwanted details are masked. Each class of indistinguishable elements is called a non-hidden closure. We proved that bisimulation of two processes is equivalent to isomorphism of non-hidden closures of two seed algebras representing these two processes. We call this kind of isomorphism a deep isomorphism. We get different models of seed algebra by specifying different axiom systems for the same signature. Each model corresponds to a different kind of bisimulation. By proving the relations between these models we also established relations between 10 different bisimulations, which form a acyclic directed graph.",2010-01-07T09:58:04Z,2010-01-07T09:58:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1043v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.1043v1,"cs.PL, cs.LO, D.3.3"

Theoretical Results on FIEGARCH Processes,"S√≠lvia R. C. Lopes, Taiane S. Prass","Here we present a theoretical study on the main properties of Fractionally Integrated Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (FIEGARCH) processes. We analyze the conditions for the existence, the invertibility, the stationarity and the ergodicity of these processes. We prove that, if $\{X_t\}_{t \in \mathds{Z}}$ is a FIEGARCH$(p,d,q)$ process then, under mild conditions, $\{\ln(X_t^2)\}_{t\in\mathds{Z}}$ is an ARFIMA$(q,d,0)$, that is, an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average process. The convergence order for the polynomial coefficients that describes the volatility is presented and results related to the spectral representation and to the covariance structure of both processes $\{\ln(X_t^2)\}_{t\in\mathds{Z}}$ and $\ {\ln(\sigma_t^2)\}_{t\in\mathds{Z}}$ are also discussed. Expressions for the kurtosis and the asymmetry measures for any stationary FIEGARCH$(p,d,q)$ process are also derived.

The work also presents a Monte Carlo simulation study showing how to generate, estimate and forecast based on six different FIEGARCH models.

Cluster and Feature Modeling from Combinatorial Stochastic Processes,"Tamara Broderick, Michael I. Jordan, Jim Pitman","One of the focal points of the modern literature on Bayesian nonparametrics has been the problem of clustering, or partitioning, where each data point is modeled as being associated with one and only one of some collection of groups called clusters or partition blocks. Underlying these Bayesian nonparametric models are a set of interrelated stochastic processes, most notably the Dirichlet process and the Chinese restaurant process. In this paper we provide a formal development of an analogous problem, called feature modeling, for associating data points with arbitrary nonnegative integer numbers of groups, now called features or topics. We review the existing combinatorial stochastic process representations for the clustering problem and develop analogous representations for the feature modeling problem. These representations include the beta process and the Indian buffet process as well as new representations that provide insight into the connections between these processes. We thereby bring the same level of completeness to the treatment of Bayesian nonparametric feature modeling that has previously been achieved for Bayesian nonparametric clustering.",2012-06-26T00:08:50Z,2013-10-01T07:33:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5862v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5862v2,"math.ST, stat.ME, stat.TH"
Giant number fluctuations in microbial ecologies,"Dipjyoti Das, Dibyendu Das, Ashok Prasad","Statistical fluctuations in population sizes of microbes may be quite large depending on the nature of their underlying stochastic dynamics. For example, the variance of the population size of a microbe undergoing a pure birth process with unlimited resources is proportional to the square of its mean. We refer to such large fluctuations, with the variance growing as square of the mean, as Giant Number Fluctuations (GNF). Luria and Delbruck showed that spontaneous mutation processes in microbial populations exhibit GNF. We explore whether GNF can arise in other microbial ecologies. We study certain simple ecological models evolving via stochastic processes: (i) bi-directional mutation, (ii) lysis-lysogeny of bacteria by bacteriophage, and (iii) horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For the case of bi-directional mutation process, we show analytically exactly that the GNF relationship holds at large times. For the ecological model of bacteria undergoing lysis or lysogeny under viral infection, we show that if the viral population can be experimentally manipulated to stay quasi-stationary, the process of lysogeny maps essentially to one-way mutation process and hence the GNF property of the lysogens follows. Finally, we show that even the process of HGT may map to the mutation process at large times, and thereby exhibits GNF.",2012-06-26T07:46:12Z,2012-06-26T07:46:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5904v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5904v1,"q-bio.PE, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph"
A Point-process Response Model for Spike Trains from Single Neurons in   Neural Circuits under Optogenetic Stimulation,"Xi Luo, Steven Gee, Vikaas S. Sohal, Dylan S. Small","Optogenetics is a new tool to study neuronal circuits that have been genetically modified to allow stimulation by flashes of light. We study recordings from single neurons within neural circuits under optogenetic stimulation. The data from these experiments present a statistical challenge of modeling a high frequency point process (neuronal spikes) while the input is another high frequency point process (light flashes). We further develop a generalized linear model approach to model the relationships between two point processes, employing additive point-process response functions. The resulting model, Point-process Responses for Optogenetics (PRO), provides explicit nonlinear transformations to link the input point process with the output one. Such response functions may provide important and interpretable scientific insights into the properties of the biophysical process that governs neural spiking in response to optogenetic stimulation. We validate and compare the PRO model using a real dataset and simulations, and our model yields a superior area-under-the- curve value as high as 93% for predicting every future spike. For our experiment on the recurrent layer V circuit in the prefrontal cortex, the PRO model provides evidence that neurons integrate their inputs in a sophisticated manner. Another use of the model is that it enables understanding how neural circuits are altered under various disease conditions and/or experimental conditions by comparing the PRO parameters.",2012-07-17T18:51:17Z,2016-12-22T03:48:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4085v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4085v2,"stat.ME, q-bio.NC, stat.AP, stat.CO"
Tacnode GUE-minor Processes and Double Aztec Diamonds,"Mark Adler, Sunil Chhita, Kurt Johansson, Pierre van Moerbeke","We study random domino tilings of a Double Aztec diamond, a region consisting of two overlapping Aztec diamonds. The random tilings give rise to two discrete determinantal point processes called the K-and L-particle processes. The correlation kernel of the K-particles was derived in Adler, Johansson and van Moerbeke (2011), who used it to study the limit process of the K-particles with different weights for horizontal and vertical dominos. Let the size of both, the Double Aztec diamond and the overlap, tend to infinity such that the two arctic ellipses just touch; then they show that the fluctuations of the K-particles near the tangency point tend to the tacnode process. In this paper, we find the limiting point process of the L-particles in the overlap when the weights of the horizontal and vertical dominos are equal, or asymptotically equal, as the Double Aztec diamond grows, while keeping the overlap finite. In this case the two limiting arctic circles are tangent in the overlap and the behavior of the L-particles in the vicinity of the point of tangency can then be viewed as two colliding GUE-minor process, which we call the tacnode GUE minor process. As part of the derivation of the kernel for the L-particles we find the inverse Kasteleyn matrix for the dimer model version of Double Aztec diamond.",2013-03-21T14:59:18Z,2013-03-21T14:59:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5279v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5279v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.CO, math.MP"

Large Deviations in Stochastic Heat-Conduction Processes Provide a   Gradient-Flow Structure for Heat Conduction,"Mark A. Peletier, Frank Redig, Kiamars Vafayi","We consider three one-dimensional continuous-time Markov processes on a lattice, each of which models the conduction of heat: the family of Brownian Energy Processes with parameter $m$, a Generalized Brownian Energy Process, and the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti process. The hydrodynamic limit of each of these three processes is a parabolic equation, the linear heat equation in the case of the BEP$(m)$ and the KMP, and a nonlinear heat equation for the GBEP($a$). We prove the hydrodynamic limit rigorously for the BEP$(m)$, and give a formal derivation for the GBEP($a$).   We then formally derive the pathwise large-deviation rate functional for the empirical measure of the three processes. These rate functionals imply gradient-flow structures for the limiting linear and nonlinear heat equations. We contrast these gradient-flow structures with those for processes describing the diffusion of mass, most importantly the class of Wasserstein gradient-flow systems. The linear and nonlinear heat-equation gradient-flow structures are each driven by entropy terms of the form $-\log \rho$; they involve dissipation or mobility terms of order $\rho^2$ for the linear heat equation, and a nonlinear function of $\rho$ for the nonlinear heat equation.",2014-03-19T22:25:05Z,2014-03-19T22:25:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4994v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4994v1,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.AP, math.MP, math.PR"
A new encoding of coalescent processes. Applications to the additive and   multiplicative cases,"Nicolas Broutin, Jean-Fran√ßois Marckert","We revisit the discrete additive and multiplicative coalescents, starting with $n$ particles with unit mass. These cases are known to be related to some ""combinatorial coalescent processes"": a time reversal of a fragmentation of Cayley trees or a parking scheme in the additive case, and the random graph process $(G(n,p))_p$ in the multiplicative case. Time being fixed, encoding these combinatorial objects in real-valued processes indexed by the line is the key to describing the asymptotic behaviour of the masses as $n\to +\infty$.   We propose to use the Prim order on the vertices instead of the classical breadth-first (or depth-first) traversal to encode the combinatorial coalescent processes. In the additive case, this yields interesting connections between the different representations of the process. In the multiplicative case, it allows one to answer to a stronger version of an open question of Aldous [Ann. Probab., vol. 25, pp. 812--854, 1997]: we prove that not only the sequence of (rescaled) masses, seen as a process indexed by the time $\lambda$, converges in distribution to the reordered sequence of lengths of the excursions above the current minimum of a Brownian motion with parabolic drift $(B_t+\lambda t - t^2/2, t\geq 0)$, but we also construct a version of the standard augmented multiplicative coalescent of Bhamidi, Budhiraja and Wang [Probab.

Weak Interaction Processes: Which Quantum Information is revealed?,B. C. Hiesmayr,We analyze the achievable limits of the quantum information processing of the weak interaction revealed by hyperons with spin. We find that the weak decay process corresponds to an interferometric device with a fixed visibility and fixed phase difference for each hyperon. Nature chooses rather low visibilities expressing a preference to parity conserving or violating processes (except for the decay $\Sigma^+\longrightarrow p \pi^0$). The decay process can be considered as an open quantum channel that carries the information of the hyperon spin to the angular distribution of the momentum of the daughter particles. We find a simple geometrical information theoretic interpretation of this process: two quantization axes are chosen spontaneously with probabilities $\frac{1\pm\alpha}{2}$ where $\alpha$ is proportional to the visibility times the real part of the phase shift. Differently stated the weak interaction process corresponds to spin measurements with an imperfect Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Equipped with this information theoretic insight we show how entanglement can be measured in these systems and why Bell's nonlocality (in contradiction to common misconception in literature) cannot be revealed in hyperon decays. We study also under which circumstances contextuality can be revealed.,2014-10-07T12:48:58Z,2014-12-15T14:13:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1707v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1707v2,"quant-ph, hep-ph, hep-th"

Helicase processivity and not the unwinding velocity exhibits universal   increase with force,"David L. Pincus, Shaon Chakrabarti, D. Thirumalai","Helicases, involved in a number of cellular functions, are motors that translocate along singlestranded nucleic acid and couple the motion to unwinding double-strands of a duplex nucleic acid. The junction between double and single strands creates a barrier to the movement of the helicase, which can be manipulated in vitro by applying mechanical forces directly on the nucleic acid strands. Single molecule experiments have demonstrated that the unwinding velocities of some helicases increase dramatically with increase in the external force, while others show little response. In contrast, the unwinding processivity always increases when the force increases. The differing responses of the unwinding velocity and processivity to force has lacked explanation. By generalizing a previous model of processive unwinding by helicases, we provide a unified framework for understanding the dependence of velocity and processivity on force and the nucleic acid sequence. We predict that the sensitivity of unwinding processivity to external force is a universal feature that should be observed in all helicases. Our prediction is illustrated using T7 and NS3 helicases as case studies. Interestingly, the increase in unwinding processivity with force depends on whether the helicase forces base pair opening by direct interaction or if such a disruption occurs spontaneously due to thermal uctuations. Based on the theoretical results, we propose that proteins like single-strand binding proteins associated with helicases in the replisome, may have co-evolved with helicases to increase the unwinding processivity even if the velocity remains unaffected.",2015-05-15T17:59:09Z,2015-05-15T17:59:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04139v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04139v1,"q-bio.BM, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Convergence of Marked Point Processes of Excesses for Dynamical Systems,"Ana Cristina Moreira Freitas, Jorge Milhazes Freitas, M√°rio Magalh√£es","We consider stochastic processes arising from dynamical systems simply by evaluating an observable function along the orbits of the system and study marked point processes associated to extremal observations of such time series corresponding to exceedances of high thresholds. Each exceedance is marked by a quantity intended to measure the severity of the exceedance. In particular, we consider marked point processes measuring the aggregate damage by adding all the excesses over the threshold that mark each exceedance (AOT) or simply by adding the largest excesses in a cluster of exceedances (POT). We provide conditions to prove the convergence of such marked point processes to a compound Poisson process, for whose multiplicity distribution we give an explicit formula. These conditions are shown to follow from a strong form of decay of correlations of the system. Moreover, we prove that the convergence of the marked point processes for a `nice' first return induced map can be carried to the original system. The systems considered include non-uniformly expanding maps (in one or higher dimensions), maps with intermittent fixed points or non-recurrent critical points. For a general class of examples, the compound Poisson limit process is computed explicitly and, in particular, in the POT case we obtain a generalised Pareto multiplicity distribution.",2015-07-02T14:20:06Z,2017-07-05T21:22:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00599v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.00599v2,"math.DS, math-ph, math.MP, math.PR"
The historical Moran model,Peter Seidel,"We consider a multi-type Moran model (in continuous time) with selection and type-dependent mutation. This paper is concerned with the evolution of genealogical information forward in time. For this purpose we define and analytically characterize a path-valued Markov process that contains in its state at time $t$ the extended ancestral lines (adding genealogical distances) of the population alive at time $t$. The main result is a representation for the conditional distribution of the extended ancestral lines of a subpopulation alive at a fixed time $T$ (present time) given the type information of the subpopulation at time $T$ in terms of the distribution of the sample paths (up to time $T$) of a special Markov process (different from the ancestral selection graph) to which we refer as backward process. This representation allows us both to prove that the extended ancestral lines converge in the limit $T \to \infty$ if the type information converges in the limit $T \to \infty$ and to study the resulting limit of the extended ancestral lines by means of the backward process. The limit theorem has two applications: First, we can represent the stationary type distribution of the common ancestor type process in terms of the equilibrium distribution of a functional of the backward process, where in the two type case we recover the common ancestor process of Fearnhead if we let the population size tend to infinity. Second, we obtain that the conditioned genealogical distance of two individuals given the types of the two individuals is distributed as a certain stopping time of a further functional of the backward process which is a new approach towards a proof that genealogical distances are stochastically smaller under selection.",2015-11-18T13:55:09Z,2015-11-18T13:55:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05781v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05781v1,"math.PR, q-bio.PE, 60K35, 60J25 (Primary), 92D25 (Secondary)"

We also obtain an exponential bound for the tail probability of the weighted approximation to the $p$-fold integrated empirical process. Applications include the two-sample testing procedures together with the change-point problems. We also consider the strong approximation of integrated empirical processes when the parameters are estimated.

Generating Time-Based Label Refinements to Discover More Precise Process   Models,"Niek Tax, Emin Alasgarov, Natalia Sidorova, Wil M. P. van der Aalst, Reinder Haakma","Process mining is a research field focused on the analysis of event data with the aim of extracting insights related to dynamic behavior. Applying process mining techniques on data from smart home environments has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions. Finding the right event labels to enable the application of process mining techniques is however far from trivial, as simply using the triggering sensor as the label for sensor events results in uninformative models that allow for too much behavior (overgeneralizing). Refinements of sensor level event labels suggested by domain experts have been shown to enable discovery of more precise and insightful process models. However, there exists no automated approach to generate refinements of event labels in the context of process mining. In this paper we propose a framework for the automated generation of label refinements based on the time attribute of events, allowing us to distinguish behaviourally different instances of the same event type based on their time attribute. We show on a case study with real life smart home event data that using automatically generated refined labels in process discovery, we can find more specific, and therefore more insightful, process models. We observe that one label refinement could have an effect on the usefulness of other label refinements when used together. Therefore, we explore four strategies to generate useful combinations of multiple label refinements and evaluate those on three real life smart home event logs.",2017-05-25T21:01:20Z,2017-10-31T16:22:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09359v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09359v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DB"

Distributed dynamic modeling and monitoring for large-scale industrial   processes under closed-loop control,"Wenqing Li, Chunhui Zhao, Biao Huang","For large-scale industrial processes under closed-loop control, process dynamics directly resulting from control action are typical characteristics and may show different behaviors between real faults and normal changes of operating conditions. However, conventional distributed monitoring approaches do not consider the closed-loop control mechanism and only explore static characteristics, which thus are incapable of distinguishing between real process faults and nominal changes of operating conditions, leading to unnecessary alarms. In this regard, this paper proposes a distributed monitoring method for closed-loop industrial processes by concurrently exploring static and dynamic characteristics. First, the large-scale closed-loop process is decomposed into several subsystems by developing a sparse slow feature analysis (SSFA) algorithm which capture changes of both static and dynamic information. Second, distributed models are developed to separately capture static and dynamic characteristics from the local and global aspects. Based on the distributed monitoring system, a two-level monitoring strategy is proposed to check different influences on process characteristics resulting from changes of the operating conditions and control action, and thus the two changes can be well distinguished from each other. Case studies are conducted based on both benchmark data and real industrial process data to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2018-09-07T06:06:54Z,2018-09-07T06:06:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03343v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03343v1,"cs.SY, cs.LG, stat.ML"

This problem arises in learning interconnections of networks of dynamical systems with spiking or binary-valued data. We allow the process to depend on its past up to a lag $p$, for a general $p \ge 1$, allowing for more realistic modeling in many applications. We propose and analyze an $\ell_1$-regularized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under the assumption that the parameter tensor is approximately sparse. Rigorous analysis of such estimators is made challenging by the dependent and non-Gaussian nature of the process as well as the presence of the nonlinearities and multi-level feedback. We derive precise upper bounds on the mean-squared estimation error in terms of the number of samples, dimensions of the process, the lag $p$ and other key statistical properties of the model.

Signal retrieval with measurement system knowledge using variational   generative model,"Zheyuan Zhu, Yangyang Sun, Johnathon White, Zenghu Chang, Shuo Pang","Signal retrieval from a series of indirect measurements is a common task in many imaging, metrology and characterization platforms in science and engineering. Because most of the indirect measurement processes are well-described by physical models, signal retrieval can be solved with an iterative optimization that enforces measurement consistency and prior knowledge on the signal. These iterative processes are time-consuming and only accommodate a linear measurement process and convex signal constraints. Recently, neural networks have been widely adopted to supersede iterative signal retrieval methods by approximating the inverse mapping of the measurement model. However, networks with deterministic processes have failed to distinguish signal ambiguities in an ill-posed measurement system, and retrieved signals often lack consistency with the measurement. In this work we introduce a variational generative model to capture the distribution of all possible signals, given a particular measurement. By exploiting the known measurement model in the variational generative framework, our signal retrieval process resolves the ambiguity in the forward process, and learns to retrieve signals that satisfy the measurement with high fidelity in a variety of linear and nonlinear ill-posed systems, including ultrafast pulse retrieval, coded aperture compressive video sensing and image retrieval from Fresnel hologram.",2019-09-09T22:41:33Z,2019-09-09T22:41:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04188v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04188v1,"eess.IV, cs.LG, eess.SP, physics.comp-ph, stat.ML"
Poisson calculus for spatial neutral to the right processes,Lancelot F. James,"Neutral to the right (NTR) processes were introduced by Doksum in 1974 as Bayesian priors on the class of distributions on the real line. Since that time there have been numerous applications to models that arise in survival analysis subject to possible right censoring. However, unlike the Dirichlet process, the larger class of NTR processes has not been used in a wider range of more complex statistical applications. Here, to circumvent some of these limitations, we describe a natural extension of NTR processes to arbitrary Polish spaces, which we call spatial neutral to the right processes. Our construction also leads to a new rich class of random probability measures, which we call NTR species sampling models. We show that this class contains the important two parameter extension of the Dirichlet process. We provide a posterior analysis, which yields tractable NTR analogues of the Blackwell--MacQueen distribution. Our analysis turns out to be closely related to the study of regenerative composition structures. A new computational scheme, which is an ordered variant of the general Chinese restaurant processes, is developed. This can be used to approximate complex posterior quantities.

In particular we obtain conditions on the symbol of the operator ensuring that certain (variable order) H\""{o}lder and H\""{o}lder-Zygmund spaces are in the domain. We use tools from probability theory to investigate the small-time asymptotics of the generalized moments of a L\'evy or L\'evy-type process $(X_t)_{t \geq 0}$, \begin{equation*}   \lim_{t \to 0} \frac 1t\left(\mathbb{E}^x f(X_t)-f(x)\right), \quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d, \end{equation*} for functions $f$ which are not necessarily bounded or differentiable. The pointwise limit exists for fixed $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ if $f$ satisfies a H\""{o}lder condition at $x$. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions which ensure that the limit exists uniformly in the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity.

Determinantal thinning of point processes with network learning   applications,"Bart≈Çomiej B≈Çaszczyszyn, Paul Keeler","A new type of dependent thinning for point processes in continuous space is proposed, which leverages the advantages of determinantal point processes defined on finite spaces and, as such, is particularly amenable to statistical, numerical, and simulation techniques. It gives a new point process that can serve as a network model exhibiting repulsion. The properties and functions of the new point process, such as moment measures, the Laplace functional, the void probabilities, as well as conditional (Palm) characteristics can be estimated accurately by simulating the underlying (non-thinned) point process, which can be taken, for example, to be Poisson. This is in contrast (and preference to) finite Gibbs point processes, which, instead of thinning, require weighting the Poisson realizations, involving usually intractable normalizing constants. Models based on determinantal point processes are also well suited for statistical (supervised) learning techniques, allowing the models to be fitted to observed network patterns with some particular geometric properties. We illustrate this approach by imitating with determinantal thinning the well-known Mat{\'e}rn~II hard-core thinning, as well as a soft-core thinning depending on nearest-neighbour triangles. These two examples demonstrate how the proposed approach can lead to new, statistically optimized, probabilistic transmission scheduling schemes.",2018-10-09T10:19:53Z,2018-11-22T19:02:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08672v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08672v2,"cs.LG, math.PR, 60D05"

Large deviations of the trajectory of empirical distributions of Feller   processes on locally compact spaces,Richard C.

Also, we define a Hamiltonian in terms of the linear generator and a Lagrangian as its Legendre transform.   We prove the large deviation principle and show that the rate function can be decomposed as a rate function for the initial time and an integral over the Lagrangian, finite only for absolutely continuous trajectories of measures.   We apply this result for diffusion and L\'evy processes on R^d, for pure jump processes with bounded jump kernel on arbitrary locally compact spaces and for discrete interacting particle systems.

In this regard, we propose modeling which comprises generalization of the nonlinear Hawkes process. Working within a Bayesian framework, model fitting is implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo. This entails discussion of computation of the likelihood for such point patterns. Furthermore, for this class of models, we discuss strategies for model comparison. Using simulation, we illustrate how well we can distinguish these models from point pattern specifications with conditionally independent event times, e.g., Poisson processes. Specifically, we demonstrate that these models can correctly identify true relationships (i.e., excitation or inhibition/control). Then, we consider a novel extension of the log Gaussian Cox process that incorporates evolutionary behavior and illustrate that our model comparison approach prefers the evolutionary log Gaussian Cox process compared to simpler models. We also examine a real dataset consisting of violent crime events from the 11th police district in Chicago from the year 2018. This data exhibits strong daily seasonality and changes across the year.

"Algorithm Unrolling: Interpretable, Efficient Deep Learning for Signal   and Image Processing","Vishal Monga, Yuelong Li, Yonina C. Eldar","Deep neural networks provide unprecedented performance gains in many real world problems in signal and image processing. Despite these gains, future development and practical deployment of deep networks is hindered by their blackbox nature, i.e., lack of interpretability, and by the need for very large training sets. An emerging technique called algorithm unrolling or unfolding offers promise in eliminating these issues by providing a concrete and systematic connection between iterative algorithms that are used widely in signal processing and deep neural networks. Unrolling methods were first proposed to develop fast neural network approximations for sparse coding. More recently, this direction has attracted enormous attention and is rapidly growing both in theoretic investigations and practical applications. The growing popularity of unrolled deep networks is due in part to their potential in developing efficient, high-performance and yet interpretable network architectures from reasonable size training sets. In this article, we review algorithm unrolling for signal and image processing. We extensively cover popular techniques for algorithm unrolling in various domains of signal and image processing including imaging, vision and recognition, and speech processing. By reviewing previous works, we reveal the connections between iterative algorithms and neural networks and present recent theoretical results. Finally, we provide a discussion on current limitations of unrolling and suggest possible future research directions.",2019-12-22T23:02:18Z,2020-08-07T05:37:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10557v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10557v3,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP"
Quantile Diffusions for Risk Analysis,"Holly Brannelly, Andrea Macrina, Gareth W. Peters","We develop a novel approach for the construction of quantile processes governing the stochastic dynamics of quantiles in continuous time. Two classes of quantile diffusions are identified: the first, which we largely focus on, features a dynamic random quantile level and allows for direct interpretation of the resulting quantile process characteristics such as location, scale, skewness and kurtosis, in terms of the model parameters. The second type are function-valued quantile diffusions and are driven by stochastic parameter processes, which determine the entire quantile function at each point in time. By the proposed innovative and simple -- yet powerful -- construction method, quantile processes are obtained by transforming the marginals of a diffusion process under a composite map consisting of a distribution and a quantile function. Such maps, analogous to rank transmutation maps, produce the marginals of the resulting quantile process. We discuss the relationship and differences between our approach and existing methods and characterisations of quantile processes in discrete and continuous time. As an example of an application of quantile diffusions, we show how probability measure distortions, a form of dynamic tilting, can be induced. Though particularly useful in financial mathematics and actuarial science, examples of which are given in this work, measure distortions feature prominently across multiple research areas.

A 3D Tractable Model for UAV-Enabled Cellular Networks With Multiple   Antennas,"Chun-Hung Liu, Di-Chun Liang, Md Asif Syed, Rung-Hung Gau","This paper aims to propose a three-dimensional (3D) point process model that can be employed to generally deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a large-scale cellular network and tractably analyze the fundamental network-wide performances of the network. The proposed 3D point process is devised based on a 2D homogeneous marked Poisson point process (PPP) in which each point and its random mark uniquely correspond to the projection and the altitude of each point in the 3D point process, respectively. We study some of the important statistical properties of the proposed 3D point process and shed light on some crucial insights into these properties that facilitate the analyses of a UAV-enabled cellular network wherein all the UAVs equipped with multiple antennas are deployed by the proposed 3D point process to serve as aerial base stations. The salient features of the proposed 3D point process lie in its suitability in practical 3D channel modeling and tractability in analysis. The downlink coverage performances of the UAV-enabled cellular network are analyzed and found in neat expressions and their closed-form results for some special cases are also derived. Most importantly, their fundamental limits achieved by cell-free massive antenna array are characterized when coordinating all the UAVs to jointly perform non-coherent downlink transmission.

"Shearer's point process, the hard-sphere model and a continuum Lov√°sz   Local Lemma",Christoph Hofer-Temmel,"A point process is R-dependent, if it behaves independently beyond the minimum distance R. This work investigates uniform positive lower bounds on the avoidance functions of R-dependent simple point processes with a common intensity. Intensities with such bounds are described by the existence of Shearer's point process, the unique R-dependent and R-hard-core point process with a given intensity. This work also presents several extensions of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, a sufficient condition on the intensity and R to guarantee the existence of Shearer's point process and exponential lower bounds. Shearer's point process shares combinatorial structure with the hard-sphere model with radius R, the unique R-hard-core Markov point process. Bounds from the Lov\'asz Local Lemma convert into lower bounds on the radius of convergence of a high-temperature cluster expansion of the hard-sphere model.

Black hole thermodynamics in finite time,Christine Gruber,"Finite-time thermodynamics provides the means to revisit ideal thermodynamic equilibrium processes in the light of reality and investigate the energetic ""price of haste"", i.e. the consequences of carrying out a process in finite time, when perfect equilibrium cannot be awaited due to economic reasons or the nature of the process. Employing the formalism of geometric thermodynamics, a lower bound on the energy dissipated during a process is derived from the thermodynamic length of that process. The notion of length is hereby defined via a metric structure on the space of equilibrium thermodynamics, spanned by a set of thermodynamic variables describing the system. Since the aim of finite-time thermodynamics is to obtain realistic limitations on idealized scenarios, it is a useful tool to reassess the efficiency of thermodynamic processes. We examine its implications for black hole thermodynamics, in particular scenarios inspired by the Penrose process, a thought experiment by which work can be extracted from a rotating black hole. We consider a Kerr black hole which, by some mechanism, is losing mass and angular momentum. Thermodynamically speaking, such a process is described in the equilibrium phase space of the black hole, but in reality, it is neither reversible nor infinitely slow. We thus calculate the dissipated energy due to non-ideal finite-time effects.",2016-01-03T23:15:24Z,2016-01-03T23:15:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00353v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00353v1,"gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, cond-mat.stat-mech"

Video Monitoring Queries,"Nick Koudas, Raymond Li, Ioannis Xarchakos","Recent advances in video processing utilizing deep learning primitives achieved breakthroughs in fundamental problems in video analysis such as frame classification and object detection enabling an array of new applications.   In this paper we study the problem of interactive declarative query processing on video streams. In particular we introduce a set of approximate filters to speed up queries that involve objects of specific type (e.g., cars, trucks, etc.) on video frames with associated spatial relationships among them (e.g., car left of truck). The resulting filters are able to assess quickly if the query predicates are true to proceed with further analysis of the frame or otherwise not consider the frame further avoiding costly object detection operations.   We propose two classes of filters $IC$ and $OD$, that adapt principles from deep image classification and object detection. The filters utilize extensible deep neural architectures and are easy to deploy and utilize. In addition, we propose statistical query processing techniques to process aggregate queries involving objects with spatial constraints on video streams and demonstrate experimentally the resulting increased accuracy on the resulting aggregate estimation.   Combined these techniques constitute a robust set of video monitoring query processing techniques. We demonstrate that the application of the techniques proposed in conjunction with declarative queries on video streams can dramatically increase the frame processing rate and speed up query processing by at least two orders of magnitude. We present the results of a thorough experimental study utilizing benchmark video data sets at scale demonstrating the performance benefits and the practical relevance of our proposals.",2020-02-24T20:53:35Z,2020-02-24T20:53:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10537v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10537v1,"cs.DB, cs.CV, eess.IV"
Remote Short Blocklength Process Monitoring: Trade-off Between   Resolution and Data Freshness,"Stefan Roth, Ahmed Arafa, H. Vincent Poor, Aydin Sezgin","In cyber-physical systems, as in 5G and beyond, multiple physical processes require timely online monitoring at a remote device. There, the received information is used to estimate current and future process values. When transmitting the process data over a communication channel, source-channel coding is used in order to reduce data errors. During transmission, a high data resolution is helpful to capture the value of the process variables precisely. However, this typically comes with long transmission delays reducing the utilizability of the data, since the estimation quality gets reduced over time. In this paper, the trade-off between having recent data and precise measurements is captured for a Gauss-Markov process. An Age-of-Information (AoI) metric is used to assess data timeliness, while mean square error (MSE) is used to assess the precision of the predicted process values. AoI appears inherently within the MSE expressions, yet it can be relatively easier to optimize. Our goal is to minimize a time-averaged version of both metrics. We follow a short blocklength source-channel coding approach, and optimize the parameters of the codes being used in order to describe an achievability region between MSE and AoI.",2020-05-11T17:50:30Z,2020-05-11T17:50:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05292v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05292v1,"cs.IT, cs.NI, eess.SP, math.IT"
Citizens at the forefront of the constitutional debate: Participation   determinants and emergent content in Chile,"M. P. Raveau, J. P. Couyoumdjian, C. Fuentes-Bravo, C. Rodriguez-Sickert, Cristian Candia","In the past few decades, constitution-making processes have shifted from closed elite writing to incorporating democratic mechanisms. Yet, little is known about democratic participation in deliberative constitution-making processes. Here, we study a deliberative constituent process held by the Chilean government between 2015 and 2016. The Chilean process had the highest level of citizen participation in the world ($204,402$ people, i.e., $1.3\%$ of the population) for such a process and covered $98\%$ of the national territory. In its participatory phase, people gathered in self-convoked groups of 10 to 30 members, and they collectively selected, deliberated, and wrote down an argument on why the new constitution should include those social rights. To understand the citizen participation drivers in this volunteer process, we first identify the determinants at the municipality level. We find the educational level, engagement in politics, support for the (left-wing) government, and Internet access increased participation. In contrast, population density and the share of evangelical Christians decreased participation. Moreover, we do not find evidence of political manipulation on citizen participation. In light of those determinants, we analyze the collective selection of social rights, and the content produced during the deliberative phase. The findings suggest that the knowledge embedded in cities, proxied using education levels and main economic activity, facilitates deliberation about themes, concepts, and ideas. These results can inform the organization of new deliberative processes that involve voluntary citizen participation, from citizen consultations to constitution-making processes.",2020-05-30T00:47:25Z,2020-05-30T00:47:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00140v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00140v1,"cs.CY, physics.soc-ph, stat.AP"
Framework on Deep Learning Based Joint Hybrid Processing for mmWave   Massive MIMO Systems,"Peihao Dong, Hua Zhang, Geoffrey Ye Li","For millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, hybrid processing architecture is essential to significantly reduce the complexity and cost but is quite challenging to be jointly optimized over the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, deep learning (DL) is applied to design a novel joint hybrid processing framework (JHPF) that allows end-to-end optimization by using back propagation. The proposed framework includes three parts: hybrid processing designer, signal flow simulator, and signal demodulator, which outputs the hybrid processing matrices for the transceiver by using neural networks (NNs), simulates the signal transmission over the air, and maps the detected symbols to the original bits by using the NN, respectively. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the recovered and original bits, the proposed framework optimizes the analog and digital processing matrices at the transceiver jointly and implicitly instead of approximating pre-designed label matrices, and its trainability is proved theoretically. It can be also directly applied to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems by simply modifying the structure of the training data. Simulation results show the proposed DL-JHPF outperforms the existing hybrid processing schemes and is robust to the mismatched channel state information and channel scenarios with the significantly reduced runtime.",2020-06-05T03:15:37Z,2020-06-05T03:15:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03215v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03215v1,"eess.SP, cs.IT, math.IT"
ParsiNorm: A Persian Toolkit for Speech Processing Normalization,"Romina Oji, Seyedeh Fatemeh Razavi, Sajjad Abdi Dehsorkh, Alireza Hariri, Hadi Asheri, Reshad Hosseini","In general, speech processing models consist of a language model along with an acoustic model. Regardless of the language model's complexity and variants, three critical pre-processing steps are needed in language models: cleaning, normalization, and tokenization. Among mentioned steps, the normalization step is so essential to format unification in pure textual applications. However, for embedded language models in speech processing modules, normalization is not limited to format unification. Moreover, it has to convert each readable symbol, number, etc., to how they are pronounced. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Persian normalization toolkits for embedded language models in speech processing modules, So in this paper, we propose an open-source normalization toolkit for text processing in speech applications. Briefly, we consider different readable Persian text like symbols (common currencies, #, @, URL, etc.), numbers (date, time, phone number, national code, etc.), and so on. Comparison with other available Persian textual normalization tools indicates the superiority of the proposed method in speech processing. Also, comparing the model's performance for one of the proposed functions (sentence separation) with other common natural language libraries such as HAZM and Parsivar indicates the proper performance of the proposed method. Besides, its evaluation of some Persian Wikipedia data confirms the proper performance of the proposed method.",2021-11-01T17:41:01Z,2021-12-15T15:07:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03470v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03470v2,"eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG"
Two-step asymptotics of scaled Dunkl processes,"Sergio Andraus, Seiji Miyashita","Dunkl processes are generalizations of Brownian motion obtained by using the differential-difference operators known as Dunkl operators as a replacement of spatial partial derivatives in the heat equation. Special cases of these processes include Dyson's Brownian motion model and the Wishart-Laguerre eigenvalue processes, which are well-known in random matrix theory. It is known that the dynamics of Dunkl processes is obtained by transforming the heat kernel using Dunkl's intertwining operator. It is also known that, under an appropriate scaling, their distribution function converges to a steady-state distribution which depends only on the coupling parameter $\beta$ as the process time $t$ tends to infinity. We study scaled Dunkl processes starting from an arbitrary initial distribution, and we derive expressions for the intertwining operator in order to calculate the asymptotics of the distribution function in two limiting situations. In the first one, $\beta$ is fixed and $t$ tends to infinity (approach to the steady state), and in the second one, $t$ is fixed and $\beta$ tends to infinity (strong-coupling limit). We obtain the deviations from the limiting distributions in both of the above situations, and we find that they are caused by the two different mechanisms which drive the process, namely, the drift and exchange mechanisms. We find that the deviation due to the drift mechanism decays as $t^{-1}$, while the deviation due to the exchange mechanism decays as $t^{-1/2}$.",2014-12-09T01:59:45Z,2016-02-02T08:34:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2832v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2832v3,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.MP"

Asymptotic equivalence for nonparametric regression with dependent   errors: Gauss-Markov processes,"Holger Dette, Martin Kroll","For the class of Gauss-Markov processes we study the problem of asymptotic equivalence of the nonparametric regression model with errors given by the increments of the process and the continuous time model, where a whole path of a sum of a deterministic signal and the Gauss-Markov process can be observed. In particular we provide sufficient conditions such that asymptotic equivalence of the two models holds for functions from a given class, and we verify these for the special cases of Sobolev ellipsoids and H\""older classes with smoothness index $> 1/2$ under mild assumptions on the Gauss-Markov process at hand. To derive these results, we develop an explicit characterization of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the Gauss-Markov process, that hinges on a characterization of such processes by a property of the corresponding covariance kernel introduced by Doob. In order to demonstrate that the given assumptions on the Gauss-Markov process are in some sense sharp we also show that asymptotic equivalence fails to hold for the special case of Brownian bridge. Our findings demonstrate that the well-known asymptotic equivalence of the Gaussian white noise model and the nonparametric regression model with i.i.d. standard normal errors can be extended to a result treating general Gauss-Markov noises in a unified manner.",2021-04-19T17:46:26Z,2021-10-24T11:40:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09485v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09485v2,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62B15, 62G08, 60G15, 62G20"

Automated data processing and feature engineering for deep learning and   big data applications: a survey,"Alhassan Mumuni, Fuseini Mumuni","Modern approach to artificial intelligence (AI) aims to design algorithms that learn directly from data. This approach has achieved impressive results and has contributed significantly to the progress of AI, particularly in the sphere of supervised deep learning. It has also simplified the design of machine learning systems as the learning process is highly automated. However, not all data processing tasks in conventional deep learning pipelines have been automated. In most cases data has to be manually collected, preprocessed and further extended through data augmentation before they can be effective for training. Recently, special techniques for automating these tasks have emerged. The automation of data processing tasks is driven by the need to utilize large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data for machine learning and big data applications. Today, end-to-end automated data processing systems based on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques are capable of taking raw data and transforming them into useful features for Big Data tasks by automating all intermediate processing stages.

The objective of this work is to provide a concise comparative analysis of Fourier and Wavelet transforms that are most commonly used as signal decomposition methods for audio processing tasks. Metrics for evaluating speech intelligibility are also discussed, namely Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR), Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), and Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI). The level of detail in the exposition is meant to be sufficient for an ML engineer to make informed decisions when choosing, fine-tuning, and evaluating a decomposition method for a specific ML model. The exposition contains mathematical definitions of the relevant concepts accompanied with intuitive non-mathematical explanations in order to make the text more accessible to engineers without deep expertise in signal processing.

Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Task Processing over   Wireless Networks,"Ahmad Halimi Razlighi, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy","In this paper, we investigated semantic communication for multi-task processing using an information-theoretic approach. We introduced the concept of a ""semantic source"", allowing multiple semantic interpretations from a single observation. We formulated an end-to-end optimization problem taking into account the communication channel, maximizing mutual information (infomax) to design the semantic encoding and decoding process exploiting the statistical relations between semantic variables. To solve the problem we perform data-driven deep learning employing variational approximation techniques. Our semantic encoder is divided into a common unit and multiple specific units to facilitate cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed semantic source and system design when statistical relationships exist, comparing cooperative task processing with independent task processing. However, our findings highlight that cooperative multi-tasking is not always beneficial, emphasizing the importance of statistical relationships between tasks and indicating the need for further investigation into the semantically processing of multiple tasks.",2024-04-12T14:03:41Z,2024-07-22T10:30:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08483v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08483v4,"eess.SP, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT"

Discrete-time SIS Social Contagion Processes on Hypergraphs,"Lidan Liang, Shaoxuan Cui, Fangzhou Liu","Recent research on social contagion processes has revealed the limitations of traditional networks, which capture only pairwise relationships, to characterize complex multiparty relationships and group influences properly. Social contagion processes on higher-order networks (simplicial complexes and general hypergraphs) have therefore emerged as a novel frontier. In this work, we investigate discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) social contagion processes occurring on weighted and directed hypergraphs and their extensions to bivirus cases and general higher-order SIS processes with the aid of tensor algebra. Our focus lies in comprehensively characterizing the healthy state and endemic equilibria within this framework. The emergence of bistability or multistability behavior phenomena, where multiple equilibria coexist and are simultaneously locally asymptotically stable, is demonstrated in view of the presence of the higher-order interaction. The novel sufficient conditions of the appearance for system behaviors, which are determined by both (higher-order) network topology and transition rates, are provided to assess the likelihood of the SIS social contagion processes causing an outbreak. More importantly, given the equilibrium is locally stable, an explicit domain of attraction associated with the system parameters is constructed. Moreover, a learning method to estimate the transition rates is presented. In the end, the attained theoretical results are supplemented via numerical examples. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of the networked SIS social contagion process by comparing it with the $2^n$-state Markov chain model. These numerical examples are given to highlight the performance of parameter learning algorithms and the system behaviors of the discrete-time SIS social contagion process.",2024-08-16T08:39:13Z,2024-08-16T08:39:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08602v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08602v1,"cs.SI, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Adaptive Knowledge-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for   Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problems with Multiple Parallel Batch Processing   Stages,"Feige Liu, Xin Li, Chao Lu, Wenying Gong","Parallel batch processing machines have extensive applications in the semiconductor manufacturing process. However, the problem models in previous studies regard parallel batch processing as a fixed processing stage in the machining process. This study generalizes the problem model, in which users can arbitrarily set certain stages as parallel batch processing stages according to their needs. A Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Parallel Batch Processing Machines (PBHFSP) is solved in this paper. Furthermore, an Adaptive Knowledge-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (AMOEA/D) is designed to simultaneously optimize both makespan and Total Energy Consumption (TEC). Firstly, a hybrid initialization strategy with heuristic rules based on knowledge of PBHFSP is proposed to generate promising solutions. Secondly, the disjunctive graph model has been established based on the knowledge to find the critical-path of PBHFS. Then, a critical-path based neighborhood search is proposed to enhance the exploitation ability of AMOEA/D. Moreover, the search time is adaptively adjusted based on learning experience from Q-learning and Decay Law. Afterward, to enhance the exploration capability of the algorithm, AMOEA/D designs an improved population updating strategy with a weight vector updating strategy. These strategies rematch individuals with weight vectors, thereby maintaining the diversity of the population. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the AMOEA/D is superior to the comparison algorithms in solving the PBHFSP.",2024-09-27T08:05:56Z,2024-09-27T08:05:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18524v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18524v1,"cs.NE, cs.SY, eess.SY"
UFLUX v2.0: A Process-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Efficient   and Explainable Modelling of Terrestrial Carbon Uptake,"Wenquan Dong, Songyan Zhu, Jian Xu, Casey M. Ryan, Man Chen, Jingya Zeng, Hao Yu, Congfeng Cao, Jiancheng Shi","Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), the amount of carbon plants fixed by photosynthesis, is pivotal for understanding the global carbon cycle and ecosystem functioning. Process-based models built on the knowledge of ecological processes are susceptible to biases stemming from their assumptions and approximations. These limitations potentially result in considerable uncertainties in global GPP estimation, which may pose significant challenges to our Net Zero goals. This study presents UFLUX v2.0, a process-informed model that integrates state-of-art ecological knowledge and advanced machine learning techniques to reduce uncertainties in GPP estimation by learning the biases between process-based models and eddy covariance (EC) measurements. In our findings, UFLUX v2.0 demonstrated a substantial improvement in model accuracy, achieving an R^2 of 0.79 with a reduced RMSE of 1.60 g C m^-2 d^-1, compared to the process-based model's R^2 of 0.51 and RMSE of 3.09 g C m^-2 d^-1. Our global GPP distribution analysis indicates that while UFLUX v2.0 and the process-based model achieved similar global total GPP (137.47 Pg C and 132.23 Pg C, respectively), they exhibited large differences in spatial distribution, particularly in latitudinal gradients. These differences are very likely due to systematic biases in the process-based model and differing sensitivities to climate and environmental conditions. This study offers improved adaptability for GPP modelling across diverse ecosystems, and further enhances our understanding of global carbon cycles and its responses to environmental changes.",2024-10-04T22:28:30Z,2024-10-04T22:28:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03951v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03951v1,"cs.LG, physics.ao-ph, q-bio.QM"
A mathematical framework to study organising principles in graphical   representations of biochemical processes,"Adittya Chaudhuri, Ralf K√∂hl, Olaf Wolkenhauer","Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardised notational system that visualises biochemical processes as networks. These visualizations lack a formal framework, so that the analysis of such networks through modelling and simulation is an entirely separate task, determined by a chosen modelling framework (e.g. differential equations, Petri nets, stochastic processes, graphs). A second research gap is the lack of a mathematical framework to compose network representations. The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction.   We address these challenges by introducing a category-theoretic formalism for biochemical processes visualised using SBGN Process Description (SBGN-PD) language. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category and demonstrate its horizontal 1-morphisms as SBGN Process Descriptions. We obtain organisational principles such as 'compositionality' (building a large SBGN-PD from smaller ones) and 'zooming-out' (abstracting away details in biochemical processes) defined in category-theoretic terms. We also formally investigate how a particular portion of a biochemical network influences the remaining portion of the network and vice versa.

Generative midtended cognition and Artificial Intelligence. Thinging   with thinging things,"Xabier E. Barandiaran, Marta P√©rez-Verdugo","This paper introduces the concept of ``generative midtended cognition'', exploring the integration of generative AI with human cognition. The term ""generative"" reflects AI's ability to iteratively produce structured outputs, while ""midtended"" captures the potential hybrid (human-AI) nature of the process. It stands between traditional conceptions of intended creation, understood directed from within, and extended processes that bring exo-biological processes into the creative process. We examine current generative technologies (based on multimodal transformer architectures typical of large language models like ChatGPT), to explain how they can transform human cognitive agency beyond what standard theories of extended cognition can capture. We suggest that the type of cognitive activity typical of the coupling between a human and generative technologies is closer (but not equivalent) to social cognition than to classical extended cognitive paradigms. Yet, it deserves a specific treatment. We provide an explicit definition of generative midtended cognition in which we treat interventions by AI systems as constitutive of the agent's intentional creative processes. Furthermore, we distinguish two dimensions of generative hybrid creativity: 1. Width: captures the sensitivity of the context of the generative process (from the single letter to the whole historical and surrounding data), 2. Depth: captures the granularity of iteration loops involved in the process. Generative midtended cognition stands in the middle depth between conversational forms of cognition in which complete utterances or creative units are exchanged, and micro-cognitive (e.g. neural) subpersonal processes. Finally, the paper discusses the potential risks and benefits of widespread generative AI adoption, including the challenges of authenticity, generative power asymmetry, and creative boost or atrophy.",2024-11-11T09:14:27Z,2024-11-11T09:14:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06812v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06812v1,"cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.LG"
A Theoretical Review of Area Production Rates as Test Statistics for   Detecting Nonequilibrium Dynamics in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes,Alexander Strang,"A stochastic process is at thermodynamic equilibrium if it obeys time-reversal symmetry; forward and reverse time are statistically indistinguishable at steady state. Non-equilibrium processes break time-reversal symmetry by maintaining circulating probability currents. In physical processes, these currents require a continual use and exchange of energy. Accordingly, signatures of non-equilibrium behavior are important markers of energy use in biophysical systems. In this article we consider a particular signature of nonequilibrium behavior: area production rates. These are, the average rate at which a stochastic process traces out signed area in its projections onto coordinate planes. Area production is an example of a linear observable: a path integral over an observed trajectory against a linear vector field. We provide a summary review of area production rates in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. Then, we show that, given an OU process, a weighted Frobenius norm of the area production rate matrix is the optimal test statistic for detecting nonequilibrium behavior in the sense that its coefficient of variation decays faster in the length of time observed than the coefficient of variation of any other linear observable. We conclude by showing that this test statistic estimates the entropy production rate of the process.",2024-11-12T07:43:41Z,2024-11-12T07:43:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07613v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07613v1,"math-ph, math.MP, math.PR, stat.AP, 62M99, 60H10, 82B35"
Understanding process-structure-property relation for elastoplastic   behavior of polymer nanocomposites with agglomeration anomalies and gradient   interphase percolation,"Prajakta Prabhune, Anlan Chen, Yigitcan Comlek, Wei Chen, L. Catherine Brinson","For polymer nanocomposites disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and hence tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. Past works have shown that particle functionalization can help tweak these interactions in attractive or repulsive directions and can produce slow or fast decay of stiffness properties in polymer nanocomposites. In absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. The interfacial elastoplastic material model is devised by combining local stiffness and glass transition measurements that were obtained by previous researchers by atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. This is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are processing artefacts that result from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength.",2024-12-02T20:51:18Z,2024-12-02T20:51:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01967v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01967v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.comp-ph"

Direct Inversion for the Squared Bessel Process and Applications,"Simon J. A. Malham, Anke Wiese, Yifan Xu","In this paper we derive a new direct inversion method to simulate squared Bessel processes. Since the transition probability of these processes can be represented by a non-central chi-square distribution, we construct an efficient and accurate algorithm to simulate non-central chi-square variables. In this method, the dimension of the squared Bessel process, equivalently the degrees of freedom of the chi-square distribution, is treated as a variable. We therefore use a two-dimensional Chebyshev expansion to approximate the inverse function of the central chi-square distribution with one variable being the degrees of freedom. The method is accurate and efficient for any value of degrees of freedom including the computationally challenging case of small values. One advantage of the method is that noncentral chi-square samples can be generated for a whole range of values of degrees of freedom using the same Chebyshev coefficients. The squared Bessel process is a building block for the well-known Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes, which can be generated from squared Bessel processes through time change and linear transformation. Our direct inversion method thus allows the efficient and accurate simulation of these processes, which are used as models in a wide variety of applications.",2024-12-21T14:55:34Z,2024-12-21T14:55:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16655v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16655v1,"stat.CO, math.PR, q-fin.CP, stat.ME"

Traditional RPA platforms often suffer from performance bottlenecks when handling high-volume repetitive processes like OCR, leading to a less efficient and more time-consuming process. LMRPA allows the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and readability of extracted text, overcoming the challenges posed by ambiguous characters and complex text structures.Extensive benchmarks were conducted comparing LMRPA to leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation Anywhere, using OCR engines like Tesseract and DocTR. The results are that LMRPA achieves superior performance, cutting the processing times by up to 52\%. For instance, in Batch 2 of the Tesseract OCR task, LMRPA completed the process in 9.8 seconds, where UiPath finished in 18.1 seconds and Automation Anywhere finished in 18.7 seconds. Similar improvements were observed with DocTR, where LMRPA outperformed other automation tools conducting the same process by completing tasks in 12.7 seconds, while competitors took over 20 seconds to do the same.

Bridging Auditory Perception and Language Comprehension through   MEG-Driven Encoding Models,"Matteo Ciferri, Matteo Ferrante, Nicola Toschi","Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.",2024-12-22T19:41:54Z,2024-12-22T19:41:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03246v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03246v1,"q-bio.NC, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD, eess.AS, eess.SP"
Do We Need to Verify Step by Step? Rethinking Process Supervision from a   Theoretical Perspective,"Zeyu Jia, Alexander Rakhlin, Tengyang Xie","As large language models have evolved, it has become crucial to distinguish between process supervision and outcome supervision -- two key reinforcement learning approaches to complex reasoning tasks. While process supervision offers intuitive advantages for long-term credit assignment, the precise relationship between these paradigms has remained an open question. Conventional wisdom suggests that outcome supervision is fundamentally more challenging due to the trajectory-level coverage problem, leading to significant investment in collecting fine-grained process supervision data.   In this paper, we take steps towards resolving this debate. Our main theorem shows that, under standard data coverage assumptions, reinforcement learning through outcome supervision is no more statistically difficult than through process supervision, up to polynomial factors in horizon. At the core of this result lies the novel Change of Trajectory Measure Lemma -- a technical tool that bridges return-based trajectory measure and step-level distribution shift. Furthermore, for settings with access to a verifier or a rollout capability, we prove that any policy's advantage function can serve as an optimal process reward model, providing a direct connection between outcome and process supervision. These findings suggest that the empirically observed performance gap -- if any -- between outcome and process supervision likely stems from algorithmic limitations rather than inherent statistical difficulties, potentially transforming how we approach data collection and algorithm design for reinforcement learning.",2025-02-14T22:21:56Z,2025-02-14T22:21:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10581v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10581v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"

From a mechanical point of view, this T1 process is an elementary relaxation process through which the entire structure of an out-of-equilibrium foam evolves. The dynamics of this elementary relaxation process has been poorly investigated and is generally neglected during simulations of foams. We study both experimentally and theoretically the T1 dynamics in a dry two-dimensional foam. We show that the dynamics is controlled by the surface viscoelastic properties of the soap films (surface shear plus dilatational viscosity, ms+k, and Gibbs elasticity e), and is independent of the shear viscosity of the bulk liquid. Moreover, our approach illustrates that the dynamics of T1 relaxation process provides a convenient tool for measuring the surface rheological properties: we obtained e = 32+/-8 mN/m and ms+k = 1.3+/-0.7 mPa.m.s for SDS, and e = 65+/-12 mN/m and ms+k = 31+/-12 mPa.m.s for BSA, in good agreement with values reported in the literature.",2006-08-18T13:19:07Z,2006-08-18T13:19:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0608426v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0608426v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.flu-dyn"

A good design space representation provides a common framework for understanding and evaluating existing mechanisms. A well-understood model of the weaving process can guide the implementor of new aspect mechanisms. It can guide the designer when mechanisms implementing new kinds of weaving are needed. It can also help teach aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In this paper we present and evaluate such a model of the design space for aspect mechanisms and their weaving processes.

The tail processes turn out to be stationary processes on the real line. Their correlation functions have determinantal form with a kernel which generalizes the well-known sine kernel arising in random matrix theory. Our second result is a law of large numbers for the Thoma parameters. We also produce Sturm-Liouville operators commuting with the Whittaker kernel introduced in Part II and with the generalized sine kernel.",1998-04-18T19:52:45Z,1998-04-18T19:52:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9804088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9804088v1,"math.RT, cond-mat, hep-th, math.PR, nlin.SI, solv-int, 20C32, 15A52, 60G55"
Correlation function of Schur process with application to local geometry   of a random 3-dimensional Young diagram,"Andrei Okounkov, Nikolai Reshetikhin","Schur process is a time-dependent analog of the Schur measure on partitions studied in math.RT/9907127. Our first result is that the correlation functions of the Schur process are determinants with a kernel that has a nice contour integral representation in terms of the parameters of the process. This general result is then applied to a particular specialization of the Schur process, namely to random 3-dimensional Young diagrams. The local geometry of a large random 3-dimensional diagram is described in terms of a determinantal point process on a 2-dimensional lattice with the incomplete beta function kernel (which generalizes the discrete sine kernel).

On Markovian Cocycle Perturbations in Classical and Quantum Probability,G. G. Amosov,"We introduce Markovian cocycle perturbations of the groups of transformations associated with the classical and quantum stochastic processes with stationary increments, which are characterized by a localization of the perturbation to the algebra of events of the past. It is namely the definition one needs because the Markovian perturbations of the Kolmogorov flows associated with the classical and quantum noises result in the perturbed group of transformations which can be decomposed in the sum of a part associated with deterministic stochastic processes lying in the past and a part associated with the noise isomorphic to the initial one. This decomposition allows to obtain some analog of the Wold decomposition for classical stationary processes excluding a nondeterministic part of the process in the case of the stationary quantum stochastic processes on the von Neumann factors which are the Markovian perturbations of the quantum noises. For the classical stochastic process with noncorrelated increaments it is constructed the model of Markovian perturbations describing all Markovian cocycles up to a unitary equivalence of the perturbations. Using this model we construct Markovian cocyclies transformating the Gaussian state $\rho $ to the Gaussian states equivalent to $\rho $.",2002-04-27T13:14:39Z,2002-04-27T13:14:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204327v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0204327v1,"math.PR, math.FA, 46L53; 46L55; 47D03"
Linearization coefficients for orthogonal polynomials using stochastic   processes,Michael Anshelevich,"Given a basis for a polynomial ring, the coefficients in the expansion of a product of some of its elements in terms of this basis are called linearization coefficients. These coefficients have combinatorial significance for many classical families of orthogonal polynomials. Starting with a stochastic process and using the stochastic measures machinery introduced by Rota and Wallstrom, we calculate and give an interpretation of linearization coefficients for a number of polynomial families. The processes involved may have independent, freely independent or q-independent increments. The use of noncommutative stochastic processes extends the range of applications significantly, allowing us to treat Hermite, Charlier, Chebyshev, free Charlier and Rogers and continuous big q-Hermite polynomials.

Likelihood inference for incompletely observed stochastic processes:   ignorability conditions,"Daniel Commenges, Anne Gegout-Petit","We develop a study of ignorability and conditions thereof for likelihood inference in the framework of stochastic processes.

For preparing the work we recall formulas for manipulating marginal and conditional likelihood ratios (which can apply to stochastic processes). Ignorability is defined in terms of local equality of two likelihood ratios. We give static conditions of ignorability and then dynamical conditions which are more interpretable.

ANOVA for diffusions and It√¥ processes,"Per Aslak Mykland, Lan Zhang","It\^{o} processes are the most common form of continuous semimartingales, and include diffusion processes. This paper is concerned with the nonparametric regression relationship between two such It\^{o} processes. We are interested in the quadratic variation (integrated volatility) of the residual in this regression, over a unit of time (such as a day). A main conceptual finding is that this quadratic variation can be estimated almost as if the residual process were observed, the difference being that there is also a bias which is of the same asymptotic order as the mixed normal error term. The proposed methodology, ``ANOVA for diffusions and It\^{o} processes,'' can be used to measure the statistical quality of a parametric model and, nonparametrically, the appropriateness of a one-regressor model in general. On the other hand, it also helps quantify and characterize the trading (hedging) error in the case of financial applications.",2006-11-09T13:50:38Z,2006-11-09T13:50:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611274v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0611274v1,"math.ST, q-fin.ST, stat.TH, 60G44, 62M09, 62M10, 91B28 (Primary) 60G42, 62G20, 62P20, 91B84

A fractional generalization of the Poisson processes,"Francesco Mainardi, Rudolf Gorenflo, Enrico Scalas","It is our intention to provide via fractional calculus a generalization of the pure and compound Poisson processes, which are known to play a fundamental role in renewal theory, without and with reward, respectively. We first recall the basic renewal theory including its fundamental concepts like waiting time between events, the survival probability, the counting function. If the waiting time is exponentially distributed we have a Poisson process, which is Markovian. However, other waiting time distributions are also relevant in applications, in particular such ones with a fat tail caused by a power law decay of its density. In this context we analyze a non-Markovian renewal process with a waiting time distribution described by the Mittag-Leffler function. This distribution, containing the exponential as particular case, is shown to play a fundamental role in the infinite thinning procedure of a generic renewal process governed by a power asymptotic waiting time. We then consider the renewal theory with reward that implies a random walk subordinated to a renewal process.",2007-01-16T16:38:40Z,2007-01-16T16:38:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0701454v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0701454v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 26.A33; 33E12; 60G50; 60K05"
Towards a homotopy theory of process algebra,Philippe Gaucher,"This paper proves that labelled flows are expressive enough to contain all process algebras which are a standard model for concurrency. More precisely, we construct the space of execution paths and of higher dimensional homotopies between them for every process name of every process algebra with any synchronization algebra using a notion of labelled flow. This interpretation of process algebra satisfies the paradigm of higher dimensional automata (HDA): one non-degenerate full $n$-dimensional cube (no more no less) in the underlying space of the time flow corresponding to the concurrent execution of $n$ actions. This result will enable us in future papers to develop a homotopical approach of process algebras.

Mixtures in non stable Levy processes,Nicola Cufaro Petroni,"We analyze the Levy processes produced by means of two interconnected classes of non stable, infinitely divisible distribution: the Variance Gamma and the Student laws. While the Variance Gamma family is closed under convolution, the Student one is not: this makes its time evolution more complicated. We prove that -- at least for one particular type of Student processes suggested by recent empirical results, and for integral times -- the distribution of the process is a mixture of other types of Student distributions, randomized by means of a new probability distribution. The mixture is such that along the time the asymptotic behavior of the probability density functions always coincide with that of the generating Student law. We put forward the conjecture that this can be a general feature of the Student processes.

Bid-Ask Dynamic Pricing in Financial Markets with Transaction Costs and   Liquidity Risk,Jocelyne Bion-Nadal,"We introduce, in continuous time, an axiomatic approach to assign to any financial position a dynamic ask (resp. bid) price process. Taking into account both transaction costs and liquidity risk this leads to the convexity (resp. concavity) of the ask (resp. bid) price. Time consistency is a crucial property for dynamic pricing. Generalizing the result of Jouini and Kallal, we prove that the No Free Lunch condition for a time consistent dynamic pricing procedure (TCPP) is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent probability measure $R$ that transforms a process between the bid process and the ask process of any financial instrument into a martingale. Furthermore we prove that the ask price process associated with any financial instrument is then a $R$-supermartingale process which has a cadlag modification. Finally we show that time consistent dynamic pricing allows both to extend the dynamics of some reference assets and to be consistent with any observed bid ask spreads that one wants to take into account. It then provides new bounds reducing the bid ask spreads for the other financial instruments.",2007-03-05T20:03:03Z,2007-03-05T20:03:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703074v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0703074v1,"math.PR, q-fin.PR, 91B28; 91B30; 91B24; 60G44"

An apparently unrelated class of processes, emerging as the scaling limits of continuous time random walks, involve subordination to the inverse or hitting time process of a classical stable subordinator. The resulting densities solve fractional Cauchy problems, an extension that involves fractional derivatives in time.

We consider in detail two specific processes having DDLRD, originally presented in Taqqu and Levy (1986), and Parke (1999). For these processes, we obtain the limiting distribution of suitably standardized discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) and sample autocovariances. At low frequencies, the standardized DFTs converge to a stable law, as do the standardized sample autocovariances at fixed lags. Finite collections of standardized sample autocovariances at a fixed set of lags converge to a degenerate distribution. The standardized DFTs at high frequencies converge to a Gaussian law. Our asymptotic results are strikingly similar for the two DDLRD processes studied. We calibrate our asymptotic results with a simulation study which also investigates the properties of the semiparametric log periodogram regression estimator of the memory parameter.",2007-05-18T13:47:49Z,2007-05-18T13:47:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2701v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.2701v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, 60G10"
Time reversal invariance in finance,Gilles Zumbach,"Time reversal invariance can be summarized as follows: no difference can be measured if a sequence of events is run forward or backward in time. Because price time series are dominated by a randomness that hides possible structures and orders, the existence of time reversal invariance requires care to be investigated. Different statistics are constructed with the property to be zero for time series which are time reversal invariant; they all show that high-frequency empirical foreign exchange prices are not invariant. The same statistics are applied to mathematical processes that should mimic empirical prices. Monte Carlo simulations show that only some ARCH processes with a multi-timescales structure can reproduce the empirical findings. A GARCH(1,1) process can only reproduce some asymmetry. On the other hand, all the stochastic volatility type processes are time reversal invariant. This clear difference related to the process structures gives some strong selection criterion for processes.",2007-08-29T20:34:02Z,2007-08-29T20:34:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.4022v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.4022v1,"q-fin.ST, physics.soc-ph, q-fin.CP"
Explicit Computations for a Filtering Problem with Point Process   Observations with Applications to Credit Risk,"Vincent Leijdekker, Peter Spreij","We consider the intensity-based approach for the modeling of default times of one or more companies. In this approach the default times are defined as the jump times of a Cox process, which is a Poisson process conditional on the realization of its intensity. We assume that the intensity follows the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. This model allows one to calculate survival probabilities and prices of defaultable bonds explicitly. In this paper we assume that the Brownian motion, that drives the intensity, is not observed. Using filtering theory for point process observations, we are able to derive dynamics for the intensity and its moment generating function, given the observations of the Cox process. A transformation of the dynamics of the conditional moment generating function allows us to solve the filtering problem, between the jumps of the Cox process, as well as at the jumps. Assuming that the initial distribution of the intensity is of the Gamma type, we obtain an explicit solution to the filtering problem for all t>0. We conclude the paper with the observation that the resulting conditional moment generating function at time t corresponds to a mixture of Gamma distributions.",2008-02-11T10:56:31Z,2008-02-11T10:56:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1407v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1407v1,"q-fin.CP, math.PR, 93E11; 60G35; 60G55"

We then disprove a conjecture about the equality between the hazard process and the martingale hazard process, which first appeared in \cite{jenbrutk1}, and we show how it should be modified to become a theorem. The pseudo-stopping times, introduced in \cite{AshkanYor}, appear as the most general class of random times for which these two processes are equal.

We show that when ${\lambda}$ is made to tend to $0$ with an appropriate normalization, the forest fire process tends to a uniquely defined process, the dynamics of which we precisely describe. The normalization consists of accelerating time by a factor $\log(1/{\lambda})$ and of compressing space by a factor ${\lambda}\log(1/{\lambda})$. The limit process is quite simple: it can be built using a graphical construction and can be perfectly simulated.

The Gaussian process is a solution of a stochastic differential equation. This Gaussian approximation together with the properties of the Gaussian process is important for the understanding of the behavior of the urn process and is also useful for statistical inferences.

Specificity and Completion Time Distributions of Biochemical Processes,"Brian Munsky, Golan Bel, Ilya Nemenman","In order to produce specific complex structures from a large set of similar biochemical building blocks, many biochemical systems require high sensitivity to small molecular differences. The first and most common model used to explain this high specificity is kinetic proofreading, which has been extended to a variety of systems from detection of DNA mismatch to cell signaling processes. While the specification properties of the kinetic proofreading model are well known and were studied in various contexts, very little is known about its temporal behavior. In this work, we study the dynamical properties of discrete stochastic two branch kinetic proofreading schemes. Using the Laplace transform of the corresponding chemical master equation, we obtain an analytical solution for the completion time distribution. In particular we provide expressions for the specificity and the mean and the variance of the process completion times. We also show that, for a wide range of parameters a process distinguishing between two different products can be reduced to a much simpler three point process.

The drawdown and the drawup are the first hitting times of the drawdown and the drawup processes respectively. In particular, we derive a closed-form formula for the Laplace transform of the probability density of the drawdown of a units when it precedes the drawup of b units. We then separately consider the special case of drifted Brownian motion, for which we derive a closed form formula for the above-mentioned density by inverting the Laplace transform.

So we study an embedded DT-SI process $W(nq+k)=X(l^n s_k)$, $q\in N$, $k= 0, ..., q-1$, and its multi-dimensional self-similar counter part $V(n)=\big(V^0(n), ..., V^{q-1}(n)\big)$ where $V^k(n)=W(nq+k)$. We study spectral representation of such process and obtain its spectral density matrix. Finally by imposing wide sense Markov property on $W(\cdot)$ and $V(\cdot)$, we show that the spectral density matrix of $V(\cdot)$ can be characterized by ${R_j(1), R_j(0), j=0, ..., q-1}$ where $R_j(k)=E[W(j+k)W(j)]$.",2010-03-05T05:31:57Z,2013-01-01T09:55:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1187v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1187v2,"math.PR, math.SP, 60G18, 62M15, 60J05"
Diffusion processes and coalescent trees,"Robert C. Griffiths, Dario Spano`","We dedicate this paper to Sir John Kingman on his 70th Birthday. In modern mathematical population genetics the ancestral history of a population of genes back in time is described by John Kingman's coalescent tree. Classical and modern approaches model gene frequencies by diffusion processes. This paper, which is partly a review, discusses how coalescent processes are dual to diffusion processes in an analytic and probabilistic sense. Bochner (1954) and Gasper (1972) were interested in characterizations of processes with Beta stationary distributions and Jacobi polynomial eigenfunctions. We discuss the connection with Wright--Fisher diffusions and the characterization of these processes. Subordinated Wright--Fisher diffusions are of this type. An Inverse Gaussian subordinator is interesting and important in subordinated Wright--Fisher diffusions and is related to the Jacobi Poisson Kernel in orthogonal polynomial theory. A related time-subordinated forest of non-mutant edges in the Kingman coalescent is novel.",2010-03-24T14:12:51Z,2010-03-24T14:12:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4650v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.4650v1,"math.PR, math.ST, q-bio.PE, stat.TH"
The M-Wright function in time-fractional diffusion processes: a tutorial   survey,"Francesco Mainardi, Antonio Mura, Gianni Pagnini","In the present review we survey the properties of a transcendental function of the Wright type, nowadays known as M-Wright function, entering as a probability density in a relevant class of self-similar stochastic processes that we generally refer to as time-fractional diffusion processes.   Indeed, the master equations governing these processes generalize the standard diffusion equation by means of time-integral operators interpreted as derivatives of fractional order. When these generalized diffusion processes are properly characterized with stationary increments, the M-Wright function is shown to play the same key role as the Gaussian density in the standard and fractional Brownian motions. Furthermore, these processes provide stochastic models suitable for describing phenomena of anomalous diffusion of both slow and fast type.",2010-04-17T10:42:13Z,2010-04-17T10:42:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2950v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.2950v1,"math-ph, math.MP, 26A33, 33E12, 33C60, 44A10, 60G18, 60G52 45K05, 74D05"
Spectral analysis of subordinate Brownian motions in half-line,Mateusz Kwasnicki,"We study one-dimensional Levy processes with Levy-Khintchine exponent psi(xi^2), where psi is a complete Bernstein function. These processes are subordinate Brownian motions corresponding to subordinators, whose Levy measure has completely monotone density; or, equivalently, symmetric Levy processes whose Levy measure has completely monotone density on the positive half-line. Examples include symmetric stable processes and relativistic processes. The main result is a formula for the generalized eigenfunctions of transition operators of the process killed after exiting the half-line. A generalized eigenfunction expansion of the transition operators is derived. As an application, a formula for the distribution of the first passage time (or the supremum functional) is obtained.",2010-06-02T23:42:03Z,2011-10-22T01:30:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0524v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.0524v4,"math.PR, math.SP, 47G30 60G51 60G52 60J35"
The Dyson Brownian minor process,"Mark Adler, Eric Nordenstam, Pierre van Moerbeke","Consider an $n\times n$ Hermitean matrix valued stochastic process $\{H_t\}_{t\geq 0}$ where the matrix elements evolve according to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. It is well known that the eigenvalues perform a so called Dyson Brownian motion, that is they behave as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes conditioned never to intersect.   In this paper we study not only the eigenvalues of the full matrix, but also the eigenvalues of all the principal minors. That is, the eigenvalues of the $k\times k$ in the upper left corner of $H_t$. If you project this process to a space-like path it is a determinantal process and we compute the kernel. This kernel contains as special cases the well known GUE minor kernel, discovered by Johansson-Nordenstam and Okounkov-Reshetikhin in 2006, and the Dyson Brownian motion kernel discovered by Forrester-Nagao in 1998.

Large Deviations Principle for a Large Class of One-Dimensional Markov   Processes,Konstantinos Spiliopoulos,"We study the large deviations principle for one dimensional, continuous, homogeneous, strong Markov processes that do not necessarily behave locally as a Wiener process. Any strong Markov process $X_{t}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous with probability one, under some minimal regularity conditions, is governed by a generalized elliptic operator $D_{v}D_{u}$, where $v$ and $u$ are two strictly increasing functions, $v$ is right continuous and $u$ is continuous. In this paper, we study large deviations principle for Markov processes whose infinitesimal generator is $\epsilon D_{v}D_{u}$ where $0<\epsilon\ll 1$. This result generalizes the classical large deviations results for a large class of one dimensional ""classical"" stochastic processes. Moreover, we consider reaction-diffusion equations governed by a generalized operator $D_{v}D_{u}$.

Asymptotic results and statistical procedures for time-changed L√©vy   processes sampled at hitting times,"Mathieu Rosenbaum, Peter Tankov","We provide asymptotic results and develop high frequency statistical procedures for time-changed L\'evy processes sampled at random instants. The sampling times are given by first hitting times of symmetric barriers whose distance with respect to the starting point is equal to $\varepsilon$. This setting can be seen as a first step towards a model for tick-by-tick financial data allowing for large jumps. For a wide class of L\'evy processes, we introduce a renormalization depending on $\varepsilon$, under which the L\'evy process converges in law to an $\alpha$-stable process as $\varepsilon$ goes to $0$. The convergence is extended to moments of hitting times and overshoots. In particular, these results allow us to construct consistent estimators of the time change and of the Blumenthal-Getoor index of the underlying L\'evy process.

Generic identification of binary-valued hidden Markov processes,Alexander Sch√∂nhuth,"The generic identification problem is to decide whether a stochastic process $(X_t)$ is a hidden Markov process and if yes to infer its parameters for all but a subset of parametrizations that form a lower-dimensional subvariety in parameter space. Partial answers so far available depend on extra assumptions on the processes, which are usually centered around stationarity. Here we present a general solution for binary-valued hidden Markov processes. Our approach is rooted in algebraic statistics hence it is geometric in nature. We find that the algebraic varieties associated with the probability distributions of binary-valued hidden Markov processes are zero sets of determinantal equations which draws a connection to well-studied objects from algebra.

We show that a process of the first kind (with mean zero and finite variance) has the same transition operators as the free Brownian motion with appropriate initial conditions, while a process of the second kind has the same transition operators as a monotone Levy process. We compute an explicit formula for the generators of these families of transition operators, in terms of singular integral operators, and prove that this formula holds on a fairly large domain.

The $2 \times 2$ skew-symmetric matrix-valued correlation kernels of the Pfaffians processes are explicitly obtained by the equivalence between the noncolliding BM and an appropriate dilatation of a time reversal of the temporally inhomogeneous version of noncolliding BM with finite duration in which all particles start from the origin, $N \delta_0$, and by the equivalence between the noncolliding BESQ$^{(\nu)}$ and that of the noncolliding squared generalized meander starting from $N \delta_0$.",2011-04-11T07:42:07Z,2011-10-03T10:31:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1864v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.1864v2,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP, nlin.SI"

Effect of collective neutrino flavor oscillations on vp-process   nucleosynthesis,"G. Mart√≠nez-Pinedo, B. Ziebarth, T. Fischer, K.

They generate, by absorption on protons, a supply of neutrons which, by (n,p) reactions, allow to overcome waiting point nuclei with rather long beta-decay and proton-capture lifetimes. The synthesis of heavy elements by the vp process depends sensitively on the \bar{\nu}_e luminosity and spectrum. As has been shown recently, the latter are affected by collective neutrino flavor oscillations which can swap the \bar{\nu}_e and \bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau} spectra above a certain split energy. Assuming such a swap scenario, we have studied the impact of collective neutrino flavor oscillations on the vp-process nucleosynthesis.

The dynamical correlation functions of the limit process are determinantal with an explicit correlation kernel. The key idea is to identify random point processes on Z with q-Gibbs measures on Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes and construct Markov processes on the latter space. Independently, we analyze the large time behavior of PushASEP with finitely many particles and particle-dependent jump rates (it arises as a marginal of our dynamics on Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes).

We develop oracle and adaptivity inequalities, as well as model selection properties, that hold under continuity of the transition probabilities and polynomial $\beta$-mixing. In particular, model misspecification is allowed.   These results are applied to interesting families of processes. For Markov processes, we obtain uniform rate of convergence for the estimation error of transition probabilities as well as perfect model selection results. For chains of infinite order with complete connections, we obtain explicit uniform rates of convergence on the estimation of conditional probabilities, which have an explicit dependence on the processes' continuity rates. Similar guarantees are also derived for renewal processes.   Our results are shown to be applicable to discrete stochastic dynamic programming problems and to dynamic discrete choice models.

The Role of the Range Parameter for Estimation and Prediction in   Geostatistics,"Cari Kaufman, Benjamin Shaby","Two canonical problems in geostatistics are estimating the parameters in a specified family of stochastic process models and predicting the process at new locations. A number of asymptotic results addressing these problems over a fixed spatial domain indicate that, for a Gaussian process with Mat\'ern covariance function, one can fix the range parameter controlling the rate of decay of the process and obtain results that are asymptotically equivalent to the case that the range parameter is known. In this paper we show that the same asymptotic results can be obtained by jointly estimating both the range and the variance of the process using maximum likelihood or maximum tapered likelihood. Moreover, we show that intuition and approximations derived from asymptotic arguments using a fixed range parameter can be problematic when applied to finite samples, even for moderate to large sample sizes. In contrast, we show via simulation that performance on a variety of metrics is improved and asymptotic approximations are applicable for smaller sample sizes when the range and variance parameters are jointly estimated. These effects are particularly apparent when the process is mean square differentiable or the effective range of spatial correlation is small.",2011-08-09T03:29:01Z,2012-10-10T01:25:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1851v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1851v2,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62M30, 62F12, 62M20"

In this paper an almost sure convergence analysis for numerical simulation algorithms for Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes is presented. The discussed numerical methods arise through discretisina a constructive method defining these processes. The stochastic problem of simulating the random, path-dependent jump times of such processes is reformulated as a hitting time problem for a system of ordinary differential equations with random threshold. Then deterministic continuous methods (methods with dense output) are serially employed to solve these problems numerically.

Numerical Analysis of Parallel Replica Dynamics,"Gideon Simpson, Mitchell Luskin","Parallel replica dynamics is a method for accelerating the computation of processes characterized by a sequence of infrequent events. In this work, the processes are governed by the overdamped Langevin equation. Such processes spend much of their time about the minima of the underlying potential, occasionally transitioning into different basins of attraction. The essential idea of parallel replica dynamics is that the exit time distribution from a given well for a single process can be approximated by the minimum of the exit time distributions of $N$ independent identical processes, each run for only 1/N-th the amount of time.   While promising, this leads to a series of numerical analysis questions about the accuracy of the exit distributions. Building upon the recent work in Le Bris et al., we prove a unified error estimate on the exit distributions of the algorithm against an unaccelerated process.

We investigate the behaviour of the PIR in relation to the multi-information rate for some simple examples, which suggest, somewhat counter-intuitively, that the PIR is maximised for very `smooth' AR processes whose power spectra have multiple poles at zero frequency. We also obtain results for moving average Gaussian processes which are consistent with the duality conjectured earlier.

Weak Markov Processes as Linear Systems,Rolf Gohm,A noncommutative Fornasini-Marchesini system (a multi-variable version of a linear system) can be realized within a weak Markov process (a model for quantum evolution). For a discrete time parameter the resulting structure is worked out systematically and some quantum mechanical interpretations are given. We introduce subprocesses and quotient processes and then the notion of a $\gamma$-extension for processes which leads to a complete classification of all the ways in which processes can be built from subprocesses and quotient processes. We show that within a $\gamma$-extension we have a cascade of noncommutative Fornasini-Marchesini systems.

Cascading map-side joins over HBase for scalable join processing,"Martin Przyjaciel-Zablocki, Alexander Sch√§tzle, Thomas Hornung, Christopher Dorner, Georg Lausen","One of the major challenges in large-scale data processing with MapReduce is the smart computation of joins. Since Semantic Web datasets published in RDF have increased rapidly over the last few years, scalable join techniques become an important issue for SPARQL query processing as well. In this paper, we introduce the Map-Side Index Nested Loop Join (MAPSIN join) which combines scalable indexing capabilities of NoSQL storage systems like HBase, that suffer from an insufficient distributed processing layer, with MapReduce, which in turn does not provide appropriate storage structures for efficient large-scale join processing. While retaining the flexibility of commonly used reduce-side joins, we leverage the effectiveness of map-side joins without any changes to the underlying framework. We demonstrate the significant benefits of MAPSIN joins for the processing of SPARQL basic graph patterns on large RDF datasets by an evaluation with the LUBM and SP2Bench benchmarks.

Extremal t processes: Elliptical domain of attraction and a spectral   representation,Thomas Opitz,"The extremal t process was proposed in the literature for modeling spatial extremes within a copula framework based on the extreme value limit of elliptical t distributions (Davison, Padoan and Ribatet (2012)). A major drawback of this max-stable model was the lack of a spectral representation such that for instance direct simulation was infeasible. The main contribution of this note is to propose such a spectral construction for the extremal t process. Interestingly, the extremal Gaussian process introduced by Schlather (2002) appears as a special case. We further highlight the role of the extremal t process as the maximum attractor for processes with finite-dimensional elliptical distributions. All results naturally also hold within the multivariate domain.",2012-07-10T10:25:00Z,2013-03-25T10:47:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2296v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2296v6,"stat.ME, stat.AP, stat.OT"
Optimal networks for Quantum Metrology: semidefinite programs and   product rules,G. Chiribella,"We investigate the optimal estimation of a quantum process that can possibly consist of multiple time steps. The estimation is implemented by a quantum network that interacts with the process by sending an input and processing the output at each time step. We formulate the search of the optimal network as a semidefinite program and use duality theory to give an alternative expression for the maximum payoff achieved by estimation. Combining this formulation with a technique devised by Mittal and Szegedy we prove a general product rule for the joint estimation of independent processes, stating that the optimal joint estimation can achieved by estimating each process independently, whenever the figure of merit is of a product form. We illustrate the result in several examples and exhibit counterexamples showing that the optimal joint network may not be the product of the optimal individual networks if the processes are not independent or if the figure of merit is not of the product form. In particular, we show that entanglement can reduce by a factor K the variance in the estimation of the sum of K independent phase shifts.",2012-07-26T05:37:05Z,2013-11-08T10:46:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6172v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6172v3,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"
Hidden information and regularities of information dynamics IIR,Vladimir S. Lerner,"Part 1 has studied the conversion of observed random process with its hidden information to related dynamic process, applying entropy functional measure (EF) of the random process and path functional information measure (IPF) of the dynamic conversion process. The variation principle, satisfying the EF-IPF equivalence along shortest path-trajectory, leads to information dual complementary maxmin-minimax law, which creates mechanism of arising information regularities from stochastic process(Lerner 2012). This Part 2 studies mechanism of cooperation of the observed multiple hidden information process, which follows from the law and produces cooperative structures, concurrently assembling in hierarchical information network (IN) and generating the IN digital genetic code. We analyze the interactive information contributions, information quality, inner time scale, information geometry of the cooperative structures, evaluate curvature of these geometrical forms and their cooperative information complexities. The law information mechanisms operate in information observer.

Representations of max-stable processes based on single extreme events,"Sebastian Engelke, Alexander Malinowski, Marco Oesting, Martin Schlather","This paper provides the basis for new methods of inference for max-stable processes \xi\ on general spaces that admit a certain incremental representation, which, in important cases, has a much simpler structure than the max-stable process itself. A corresponding peaks-over-threshold approach will incorporate all single events that are extreme in some sense and will therefore rely on a substantially larger amount of data in comparison to estimation procedures based on block maxima. Conditioning a process \eta\ in the max-domain of attraction of \xi\ on being extremal, several convergence results for the increments of \eta\ are proved. In a similar way, the shape functions of mixed moving maxima (M3) processes can be extracted from suitably conditioned single events \eta.

Duality for stochastic models of transport,"Gioia Carinci, Cristian Giardina', Claudio Giberti, Frank Redig","We study three classes of continuous time Markov processes (inclusion process, exclusion process, independent walkers) and a family of interacting diffusions (Brownian energy process). For each model we define a boundary driven process which is obtained by placing the system in contact with proper reservoirs, working at different particles densities or different temperatures. We show that all the models are exactly solvable by duality, using a dual process with absorbing boundaries. The solution does also apply to the so-called thermalization limit in which particles or energy is instantaneously redistributed among sites. The results shows that duality is a versatile tool for analyzing stochastic models of transport, while the analysis in the literature has been so far limited to particular instances. Long-range correlations naturally emerge as a result of the interaction of dual particles at the microscopic level and the explicit computations of covariances match, in the scaling limit, the predictions of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.",2012-12-13T12:47:57Z,2013-06-11T07:14:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3154v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.3154v2,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.MP, math.PR"

These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density -- the Fourier transform of a kernel -- with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic.

Determinantal Martingales and Interacting Particle Systems,Makoto Katori,"Determinantal process is a dynamical extension of a determinantal point process such that any spatio-temporal correlation function is given by a determinant specified by a single continuous function called the correlation kernel. Noncolliding diffusion processes are important examples of determinantal processes. In the present lecture, we introduce determinantal martingales and show that if the interacting particle system (IPS) has determinantal-martingale representation, then it becomes a determinantal process. From this point of view, the reason why noncolliding diffusion processes and noncolliding random walk are determinantal is simply explained by the fact that the harmonic transform with the Vandermonde determinant provides a proper determinantal martingale. Recently O'Connell introduced an interesting IPS, which can be regarded as a stochastic version of a quantum Toda lattice. It is a geometric lifting of the noncolliding Brownian motion and is not determinantal, but Borodin and Corwin discovered a determinant formula for a special observable for it. We also discuss this new topic from the present view-point of determinantal martingale.",2013-07-09T04:27:51Z,2013-07-09T04:27:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2332v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.2332v1,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"
"Stochastic processes with random contexts: a characterization, and   adaptive estimators for the transition probabilities",Roberto Imbuzeiro Oliveira,"This paper introduces the concept of random context representations for the transition probabilities of a finite-alphabet stochastic process. Processes with these representations generalize context tree processes (a.k.a. variable length Markov chains), and are proven to coincide with processes whose transition probabilities are almost surely continuous functions of the (infinite) past. This is similar to a classical result by Kalikow about continuous transition probabilities. Existence and uniqueness of a minimal random context representation are proven, and an estimator of the transition probabilities based on this representation is shown to have very good ""pastwise adaptativity"" properties. In particular, it achieves minimax performance, up to logarithmic factors, for binary renewal processes with bounded $2+\gamma$ moments.",2013-09-11T13:17:55Z,2016-12-08T11:48:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2819v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2819v2,"math.PR, cs.IT, math.IT, math.ST, stat.TH, 60F99, 62M09, 62B10"

This complements the results of [26], [19], and [20]: put together these results provide a unified framework for proving convergence of clock processes. As a first application we prove that Bouchaud's asymmetric trap model on ${\Bbb Z}^d$ exhibits a normal aging behavior for all $d\geq 2$. Namely, we show that certain two-time correlation functions, among which the classical probability to find the process at the same site at two time points, converge, as the age of the process diverges, to the distribution function of the arcsine law.

As a result the point process at a turning point is not the GUE minor process, but rather a pair of GUE minor processes, non-trivially correlated.   We also study an intermediate regime when the weights are periodic but all converge to 1. In this regime the limit shape and correlations in the bulk are the same as in the case of homogeneous weights and periodicity is not visible in the bulk.

Moreover, this approximation can be causal, i.e., at every time it requires only past historical values of the underlying process.

We put forth a new definition of time-vertex wide-sense stationarity, or joint stationarity for short, that goes beyond product graphs. Joint stationarity helps by reducing the estimation variance and recovery complexity. In particular, for any jointly stationary process (a) one reliably learns the covariance structure from as little as a single realization of the process, and (b) solves MMSE recovery problems, such as interpolation and denoising, in computational time nearly linear on the number of edges and timesteps. Experiments with three datasets suggest that joint stationarity can yield accuracy improvements in the recovery of high-dimensional processes evolving over a graph, even when the latter is only approximately known, or the process is not strictly stationary.",2016-11-01T14:56:33Z,2019-07-08T12:34:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00255v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00255v3,"cs.LG, cs.DS, stat.ML"

Selection is defined based on the idea that individuals first choose a (random) number of $\textit{potential}$ parents from the previous generation and then, from the selected pool, they inherit the type of the fittest parent. The probability distribution function of the number of potential parents per individual thus parametrises entirely the selection mechanism. Using sampling- and moment-duality, weak convergence is then proved both for the allele frequency process of the selectively weak type and for the population's ancestral process. The scaling limits are, respectively, a two-types $\Xi$-Fleming-Viot jump-diffusion process with frequency-dependent selection, and a branching-coalescing process with general branching and simultaneous multiple collisions.

We show that the time integral of our process can be approximated by the sum of a linear Gaussian process and independent Gaussian fluctuations whose covariance matrix is computed explicitly. We interpret these results in terms of the Gaussian Free Field convergence for the random matrix models.

A non-increasing tree growth process for recursive trees and   applications,Laura Eslava,"We introduce a non-increasing tree growth process $((T_n,\sigma_n),\, n\ge 1)$, where $T_n$ is a rooted labeled tree on $n$ vertices and ${\sigma}_n$ is a permutation of the vertex labels. The construction of $(T_{n},{\sigma}_n)$ from $(T_{n-1},{\sigma}_{n-1})$ involves rewiring a random (possibly empty) subset of edges in $T_{n-1}$ towards the newly added vertex; as a consequence $T_{n-1} \not\subset T_n$ with positive probability. The key feature of the process is that the shape of $T_n$ has the same law as that of a random recursive tree, while the degree distribution of any given vertex is not monotonous in the process.   We present two applications. First, while couplings between Kingman's coalescent and random recursive trees where known for any fixed $n$, this new process provides a non-standard coupling of all finite Kingman's coalescents. Second, we use the new process and the Chen-Stein method to extend the well-understood properties of degree distribution of random recursive trees to extremal-range cases. Namely, we obtain convergence rates on the number of vertices with degree at least $c\ln n$, $c\in (1,2)$, in trees with $n$ vertices.

Bhattacharya, Shankar Ghosh","The roles of applied strain and temperature on the hydration dynamics of cement paste are uncovered in the present study. We find that the system hardens over time through two different aging processes. The first process dominates the initial period of hydration and is characterized by the shear stress $\sigma$ varying sub-linearly with the strain-rate $\dot{\gamma}$; during this process the system is in a relatively low-density state and the inter-particle interactions are dominated by hydrodynamic lubrication. At a later stage of hydration the system evolves to a high-density state where the interactions become frictional, and $\sigma$ varies super-linearly with $\dot{\gamma}$; this is identified as the second process. An instability, indicated by a drop in $\sigma$, that is non-monotonic with $\dot{\gamma}$ and can be tuned by temperature, separates the two processes. Both from rheology and microscopy studies we establish that the observed instability is related to fracture mechanics of space-filling structure.",2017-03-01T12:35:48Z,2017-03-01T12:35:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00264v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00264v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"

In the particular case of $s=0$, this stochastic process is closely related to the $\mathsf{Sine_2}$ point process on $\mathbb{R}$ that describes the spectrum in the bulk of large random matrices. Equivalently, these coherent dynamics are associated to interlacing diffusions in Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns having certain Gibbs invariant measures. Moreover, under an application of the Cayley transform when $s=0$ we obtain processes on the circle leaving invariant the multilevel Circular Unitary Ensemble.

Analysis of Stochastic Quantization for the fractional Edwards Measure,"Wolfgang Bock, Torben Fattler","We analyse a diffusion process whose invariant measure is the fractional polymer or Edwards measure for fractional Brownian motion in dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$ with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$ fulfilling $dH < 1$. We make use of a construction of the diffusion via Dirichlet form techniques in infinite dimensional (Gaussian) analysis. By providing a Fukushima decomposition for the stochastic quantization of the fractional Edwards measure we prove that the constructed process solves weakly a stochastic differential equation in infinite dimension for quasi-all starting points. Moreover, the solution process is driven by an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process taking values in an infinite dimensional distribution space and is unique, in the sense that the underlying Dirichlet form is Markov unique. The equilibrium measure, which is by construction the fractional Edwards measure, is specified to be an extremal Gibbs state and therefore, the constructed stochastic dynamics is time ergodic. The studied stochastic differential equation provides in the language of polymer physics the dynamics of the bonds, i.e. stochastically spoken the noise of the process.

For max-stable processes with Fr{\'e}chet margins we provide conditions, such that the empirical extremogram (or a bias-corrected version) centred by its true version is asymptotically normal. In a second step, for a parametric extremogram model, we fit the parameters by generalised least squares estimation and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimates.

Furthermore, by moving to a dual model of epistemic logic defined by simplicial complexes, topological invariants are exposed, which determine task solvability.

Up to now only few results for multivariate kernels are known. Additionally, most theory was established under independence or for short range dependent processes. In this paper we establish a central limit theorem for $GL$-statistics of functionals of short range dependent data, in particular near epoch dependent sequences on absolutely regular processes, and arbitrary dimension of the underlying kernel. This limit theorem is based on the theory of $U$-statistics and $U$-processes, for which we show a central limit theorem as well as an invariance principle.

Design and Analysis of the NIPS 2016 Review Process,"Nihar B. Shah, Behzad Tabibian, Krikamol Muandet, Isabelle Guyon, Ulrike von Luxburg","Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is a top-tier annual conference in machine learning. The 2016 edition of the conference comprised more than 2,400 paper submissions, 3,000 reviewers, and 8,000 attendees. This represents a growth of nearly 40% in terms of submissions, 96% in terms of reviewers, and over 100% in terms of attendees as compared to the previous year. The massive scale as well as rapid growth of the conference calls for a thorough quality assessment of the peer-review process and novel means of improvement. In this paper, we analyze several aspects of the data collected during the review process, including an experiment investigating the efficacy of collecting ordinal rankings from reviewers. Our goal is to check the soundness of the review process, and provide insights that may be useful in the design of the review process of subsequent conferences.",2017-08-31T16:09:33Z,2018-04-23T18:22:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09794v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09794v2,"cs.DL, cs.LG, cs.SI, stat.ML"
Condensation of Non-Reversible Zero-Range Processes,Insuk Seo,"In this article, we investigate the condensation phenomena for a class of nonreversible zero-range processes on a fixed finite set. By establishing a novel inequality bounding the capacity between two sets, and by developing a robust framework to perform quantitative analysis on the metastability of non-reversible processes, we prove that the condensed site of the corresponding zero-range processes approximately behaves as a Markov chain on the underlying graph whose jump rate is proportional to the capacity with respect to the underlying random walk. The results presented in the current paper complete the generalization of the work of Beltran and Landim [4] on reversible zero-range processes, and that of Landim [22] on totally asymmetric zero-range processes on a one-dimensional discrete torus.",2018-01-18T04:48:14Z,2018-12-05T16:34:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05934v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05934v2,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP"
L√©vy processes with respect to the index Whittaker convolution,"R√∫ben Sousa, Manuel Guerra, Semyon Yakubovich","The index Whittaker convolution operator, recently introduced by the authors, gives rise to a convolution measure algebra having the property that the convolution of probability measures is a probability measure. In this paper, we introduce the class of L\'evy processes with respect to the index Whittaker convolution and study their basic properties. We prove that the square root of the Shiryaev process belongs to our family of L\'evy process, and this is shown to yield a martingale characterization of the Shiryaev process analogous to L\'evy's characterization of Brownian motion.   Our results demonstrate that a nice theory of L\'evy processes with respect to generalized convolutions can be developed even if the usual compactness assumption on the support of the convolution fails, shedding light into the connection between the properties of the convolution algebra and the nature of the singularities of the associated differential operator.",2018-05-08T14:25:27Z,2018-05-08T14:25:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03051v1,"math.PR, math.CA, 60G51, 60B15, 47D07, 33C15"
Approximation of the probability density function of the randomized heat   equation with non-homogeneous boundary conditions,"J. Calatayud, J. C. Cort√©s, M.

The solution is a stochastic process that can be related, via changes of variable, with the solution stochastic process of the random heat equation defined on $[0,1]$ with homogeneous boundary conditions. Results in the extant literature establish conditions under which the probability density function of the solution process to the random heat equation on $[0,1]$ with homogeneous boundary conditions can be approximated. Via the changes of variable and the Random Variable Transformation technique, we set mild conditions under which the probability density function of the solution process to the random heat equation on a general bounded interval $[L_1,L_2]$ and with non-homogeneous boundary conditions can be approximated uniformly or pointwise. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions in order that the expectation and the variance of the solution stochastic process can be computed from the proposed approximations of the probability density function.

Limit Theory for Moderate Deviation from Integrated GARCH Processes,Yubo Tao,"This paper develops the limit theory of the GARCH(1,1) process that moderately deviates from IGARCH process towards both stationary and explosive regimes.

The asymptotic theory developed in this paper extends Berkes et al. (2005) by allowing the parameters to have a slower convergence rate.

Adaptive estimating function inference for non-stationary determinantal   point processes,"Fr√©d√©ric Lavancier, Arnaud Poinas, Rasmus Waagepetersen",Estimating function inference is indispensable for many common point process models where the joint intensities are tractable while the likelihood function is not. In this paper we establish asymptotic normality of estimating function estimators in a very general setting of non-stationary point processes. We then adapt this result to the case of non-stationary determinantal point processes which are an important class of models for repulsive point patterns. In practice often first and second order estimating functions are used. For the latter it is common practice to omit contributions for pairs of points separated by a distance larger than some truncation distance which is usually specified in an ad hoc manner. We suggest instead a data-driven approach where the truncation distance is adapted automatically to the point process being fitted and where the approach integrates seamlessly with our asymptotic framework. The good performance of the adaptive approach is illustrated via simulation studies for non-stationary determinantal point processes and by an application to a real dataset.,2018-06-16T12:19:51Z,2019-11-15T10:14:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06231v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06231v2,"math.ST, stat.ME, stat.TH"
Large-Scale Stochastic Sampling from the Probability Simplex,"Jack Baker, Paul Fearnhead, Emily B Fox, Christopher Nemeth","Stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) has become a popular method for scalable Bayesian inference. These methods are based on sampling a discrete-time approximation to a continuous time process, such as the Langevin diffusion. When applied to distributions defined on a constrained space the time-discretization error can dominate when we are near the boundary of the space. We demonstrate that because of this, current SGMCMC methods for the simplex struggle with sparse simplex spaces; when many of the components are close to zero. Unfortunately, many popular large-scale Bayesian models, such as network or topic models, require inference on sparse simplex spaces. To avoid the biases caused by this discretization error, we propose the stochastic Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process (SCIR), which removes all discretization error and we prove that samples from the SCIR process are asymptotically unbiased. We discuss how this idea can be extended to target other constrained spaces. Use of the SCIR process within a SGMCMC algorithm is shown to give substantially better performance for a topic model and a Dirichlet process mixture model than existing SGMCMC approaches.",2018-06-19T10:08:37Z,2018-10-26T16:06:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07137v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07137v2,"stat.CO, cs.LG, stat.ML"

We show that the centre-of-mass like variable corresponding to this ensemble is statistically equivalent to a process driven by a non-autonomous stochastic differential equation with time- dependent drift and a white noise. In particular, the time scaling and the density function of such variable are driven by the population of timescales and of noise amplitudes, respectively. Moreover, we show that this variable is equivalent in distribution to a randomly-scaled Gaussian process, i.e., a process built by the product of a Gaussian process times a non-negative independent random variable. This last result establishes a connection with the so-called generalized gray Brownian motion and suggests application to model fractional anomalous diffusion in biological systems.",2018-06-29T10:52:56Z,2018-06-29T10:52:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11351v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11351v1,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.MP, math.PR"
Gaussian One-Armed Bandit and Optimization of Batch Data Processing,Alexander Kolnogorov,"We consider the minimax setup for Gaussian one-armed bandit problem, i.e. the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian distributions of incomes and known distribution corresponding to the first arm. This setup naturally arises when the optimization of batch data processing is considered and there are two alternative processing methods available with a priori known efficiency of the first method. One should estimate the efficiency of the second method and provide predominant usage of the most efficient of both them. According to the main theorem of the theory of games minimax strategy and minimax risk are searched for as Bayesian ones corresponding to the worst-case prior distribution. As a result, we obtain the recursive integro-difference equation and the second order partial differential equation in the limiting case as the number of batches goes to infinity. This makes it possible to determine minimax risk and minimax strategy by numerical methods. If the number of batches is large enough we show that batch data processing almost does not influence the control performance, i.e. the value of the minimax risk. Moreover, in case of Bernoulli incomes and large number of batches, batch data processing provides almost the same minimax risk as the optimal one-by-one data processing.",2019-01-25T11:57:13Z,2019-01-25T11:57:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08845v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08845v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, 93E20, 62L05 (Primary), 62C20, 62C10, 62F35 (secondary)"

Further, we formulate this nonlinear model's state space representation, making it amenable to infinite-horizon Gaussian process regression with approximate inference via expectation propagation, which scales linearly in the number of time steps and quadratically in the state dimensionality.

When the number of sources is large, the maximum likelihood estimator is intractable due to its very high complexity, and therefore alternative signal processing methods have been developed with some performance loss. In this paper, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) approach to the problem and analyze its advantages with respect to signal processing algorithms.

We assume that the transmitter does not know the channel conditions, therefore it would be transmitting information over a fixed rate. The fixed rate transmission is modeled as a two-state continuous-time Markov process, where the optimum transmission rate is obtained. Moreover, we conduct a performance analysis for different arrival traffic originated from MTC device via effective rate transmission. We consider that the arrival traffic is modeled as a Markovian process namely Discrete-Time Markov process, Fluid Markov process, and Markov Modulated Poisson process, under delay violation constraints.

Optimal scheduling of critically loaded multiclass GI/M/n+M queues in an   alternating renewal environment,"Ari Arapostathis, Guodong Pang, Yi Zheng","In this paper, we study optimal control problems for multiclass GI/M/n+M queues in an alternating renewal (up-down) random environment in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Assuming that the downtimes are asymptotically negligible and only the service processes are affected, we show that the limits of the diffusion-scaled state processes under non-anticipative, preemptive, work-conserving scheduling policies, are controlled jump diffusions driven by a compound Poisson jump process. We establish the asymptotic optimality of the infinite-horizon discounted and long-run average (ergodic) problems for the queueing dynamics.   Since the process counting the number of customers in each class is not Markov, the usual martingale arguments for convergence of mean empirical measures cannot be applied. We surmount this obstacle by demonstrating the convergence of the generators of an augmented Markovian model which incorporates the age processes of the renewal interarrival times and downtimes. We also establish long-run average moment bounds of the diffusion-scaled queueing processes under some (modified) priority scheduling policies. This is accomplished via Foster-Lyapunov equations for the augmented Markovian model.",2019-08-17T18:29:22Z,2019-08-17T18:29:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06329v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06329v1,"math.OC, math.PR, Primary: 90B22, 90B36, 60K37.

Dirichlet Depths for Point Process,"Kai Qi, Yang Chen, Wei Wu","Statistical depths have been well studied for multivariate and functional data over the past few decades, but remain under-explored for point processes. A first attempt on the notion of point process depth was conducted recently where the depth was defined as a weighted product of two terms: (1) the probability of the number of events in each process and (2) the depth of the event times conditioned on the number of events by using a Mahalanobis depth. We point out that multivariate depths such as the Mahalanobis depth cannot be directly used because they often neglect the important ordered property in the point process events. To deal with this problem, we propose a model-based approach for point processes systematically. In particular, we develop a Dirichlet-distribution-based framework on the conditional depth term, where the new methods are referred to as Dirichlet depths. We examine the mathematical properties of the new depths and conduct the asymptotic analysis. In addition, we illustrate the new methods using various simulated and real experiment data. It is found that the proposed framework provides a proper center-outward rank and the new methods have superior decoding performance to previous methods in two neural spike train datasets.",2019-09-16T16:36:47Z,2019-09-16T16:36:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07324v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07324v1,"stat.ME, math.ST, stat.TH"

We derive the marginal distribution of the resultant point process, when the underlying CRM is marginalized out. Using well known properties unique to Poisson processes, we were able to derive an exact approach for instantiating a Poisson process with a hierarchical CRM prior. Furthermore, we derive Gibbs sampling strategies for hierarchical CRM models based on Chinese restaurant franchise sampling scheme.

We first apply the theory to study inference in parametric and nonparametric regression models involving WNPs as covariates. We then use these results to develop a new specification test for parametric regression models. By construction, our specification test statistic has a chi-squared limiting distribution regardless of the form and extent of persistence of the regressor, implying that a practitioner can validly perform the test using a fixed critical value, while remaining agnostic about the mechanism generating the regressor.

Consider a given p.d. kernel $K$, presented as a covariance kernel for a Gaussian process $V$. We then give an explicit duality for these two seemingly different notions of factorization, for p.d. kernel $K$, vs for Gaussian process $V$. Our result is in the form of an explicit correspondence.

We further use this new Bernstein-type inequality to derive an oracle inequality for generic regularized empirical risk minimization algorithms and data generated by such processes. Applying this oracle inequality to support vector machines using the Gaussian kernels for both least squares and quantile regression, it turns out that the resulting learning rates match, up to some arbitrarily small extra term in the exponent, the optimal rates for i.i.d.~processes.",2015-01-13T16:04:23Z,2015-01-13T16:04:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03059v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.03059v1,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 60E15, 60G10, 37D20, 60F10, 68T05, 62G08, 62M10"
A Conditional Generative Model for Predicting Material Microstructures   from Processing Methods,"Akshay Iyer, Biswadip Dey, Arindam Dasgupta, Wei Chen, Amit Chakraborty","Microstructures of a material form the bridge linking processing conditions - which can be controlled, to the material property - which is the primary interest in engineering applications. Thus a critical task in material design is establishing the processing-structure relationship, which requires domain expertise and techniques that can model the high-dimensional material microstructure. This work proposes a deep learning based approach that models the processing-structure relationship as a conditional image synthesis problem. In particular, we develop an auxiliary classifier Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (ACWGAN-GP) to synthesize microstructures under a given processing condition. This approach is free of feature engineering, requires modest domain knowledge and is applicable to a wide range of material systems. We demonstrate this approach using the ultra high carbon steel (UHCS) database, where each microstructure is annotated with a label describing the cooling method it was subjected to. Our results show that ACWGAN-GP can synthesize high-quality multiphase microstructures for a given cooling method.",2019-10-04T20:13:11Z,2019-10-04T20:13:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02133v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02133v1,"eess.IV, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG, stat.ML"
Regeneration-enriched Markov processes with application to Monte Carlo,"Andi Q. Wang, Murray Pollock, Gareth O. Roberts, David Steinsaltz","We study a class of Markov processes that combine local dynamics, arising from a fixed Markov process, with regenerations arising at a state-dependent rate. We give conditions under which such processes possess a given target distribution as their invariant measures, thus making them amenable for use within Monte Carlo methodologies. Since the regeneration mechanism can compensate the choice of local dynamics, while retaining the same invariant distribution, great flexibility can be achieved in selecting local dynamics, and the mathematical analysis is simplified. We give straightforward conditions for the process to possess a central limit theorem, and additional conditions for uniform ergodicity and for a coupling from the past construction to hold, enabling exact sampling from the invariant distribution. We further consider and analyse a natural approximation of the process which may arise in the practical simulation of some classes of continuous-time dynamics.",2019-10-11T09:12:26Z,2020-06-22T15:12:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05037v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05037v3,"math.PR, stat.ME, 60J40, 60J22 (Primary), 60J25, 65C05 (Secondary)"

Extreme first passage times of piecewise deterministic Markov processes,Sean D Lawley,"The time it takes the fastest searcher out of $N\gg1$ searchers to find a target determines the timescale of many physical, chemical, and biological processes. This time is called an extreme first passage time (FPT) and is typically much faster than the FPT of a single searcher. Extreme FPTs of diffusion have been studied for decades, but little is known for other types of stochastic processes. In this paper, we study the distribution of extreme FPTs of piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). PDMPs are a broad class of stochastic processes that evolve deterministically between random events. Using classical extreme value theory, we prove general theorems which yield the distribution and moments of extreme FPTs in the limit of many searchers based on the short time distribution of the FPT of a single searcher. We then apply these theorems to some canonical PDMPs, including run and tumble searchers in one, two, and three space dimensions. We discuss our results in the context of some biological systems and show how our approach accounts for an unphysical property of diffusion which can be problematic for extreme statistics.",2019-12-07T04:45:09Z,2019-12-07T04:45:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03438v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03438v1,"math.PR, q-bio.CB, q-bio.SC, 60G70, 92C05"
A statistical test for correspondence of texts to the Zipf-Mandelbrot   law,"Anik Chakrabarty, Mikhail Chebunin, Artyom Kovalevskii, Ilya Pupyshev, Natalia Zakrevskaya, Qianqian Zhou","We analyse correspondence of a text to a simple probabilistic model. The model assumes that the words are selected independently from an infinite dictionary. The probability distribution correspond to the Zipf---Mandelbrot law. We count sequentially the numbers of different words in the text and get the process of the numbers of different words. Then we estimate Zipf---Mandelbrot law parameters using the same sequence and construct an estimate of the expectation of the number of different words in the text. Then we subtract the corresponding values of the estimate from the sequence and normalize along the coordinate axes, obtaining a random process on a segment from 0 to 1. We prove that this process (the empirical text bridge) converges weakly in the uniform metric on $C (0,1)$ to a centered Gaussian process with continuous a.s. paths. We develop and implement an algorithm for approximate calculation of eigenvalues of the covariance function of the limit Gaussian process, and then an algorithm for calculating the probability distribution of the integral of the square of this process.

Age of Information for Updates with Distortion: Constant and   Age-Dependent Distortion Constraints,"Melih Bastopcu, Sennur Ulukus","We consider an information update system where an information receiver requests updates from an information provider in order to minimize its age of information. The updates are generated at the information provider (transmitter) as a result of completing a set of tasks such as collecting data and performing computations. We refer to this as the update generation process. We model the $quality$ of an update as an increasing function of the processing time spent while generating the update at the transmitter. In particular, we use $distortion$ as a proxy for $quality$, and model distortion as a decreasing function of processing time. Processing longer at the transmitter results in a better quality (lower distortion) update, but it causes the update to age. We determine the age-optimal policies for the update request times at the receiver and the update processing times at the transmitter subject to a minimum required quality (maximum allowed distortion) constraint on the updates. For the required quality constraint, we consider the cases of constant maximum allowed distortion constraints, as well as age-dependent maximum allowed distortion constraints.",2019-12-31T18:46:43Z,2020-04-26T17:53:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13493v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13493v2,"cs.IT, cs.NI, eess.SP, math.IT"
Multi-way Graph Signal Processing on Tensors: Integrative analysis of   irregular geometries,"Jay S. Stanley III, Eric C.

As acquired data is increasingly taking the form of multi-way tensors, new signal processing tools are needed to maximally utilize the multi-way structure within the data. In this paper, we review modern signal processing frameworks generalizing GSP to multi-way data, starting from graph signals coupled to familiar regular axes such as time in sensor networks, and then extending to general graphs across all tensor modes. This widely applicable paradigm motivates reformulating and improving upon classical problems and approaches to creatively address the challenges in tensor-based data.

Moreover, we explicitly compute the strong mixing or weak dependence coefficients of the renewal sampled process and show that exponential or power decay of the coefficients of $X$ is preserved (at least asymptotically).

Empirical studies of networks have identified feedback loops, feedforward loops, and several other small structures as ""motifs"" that occur frequently in real-world networks and may contribute by various mechanisms to important functions in these systems. However, these mechanisms are unknown for many of these motifs. We propose to distinguish between ""structure motifs"" (i.e., graphlets) in networks and ""process motifs"" (which we define as structured sets of walks) on networks and consider process motifs as building blocks of processes on networks.

On one hand this allows modellers to use appropriate boundary conditions with confidence when restricting the modelling domain. On the other hand it allows for numerical techniques based on differential equation solvers to obtain fast approximations of densities or other statistical properties of restricted one-sided L\'evy processes encountered, for example, in finance. In particular we identify a new nonlocal mass conserving boundary condition by showing it corresponds to fast-forwarding, i.e. removing the time the process spends outside the domain. We treat all combinations of killing, reflecting and fast-forwarding boundary conditions.   In Part I we show wellposedness of the backward and forward Cauchy problems with a one-sided pseudo-differential operator with boundary conditions as generator. We do so by showing convergence of Feller semigroups based on grid point approximations of the modified L\'evy process.

Real-Time Fault Detection and Process Control Based on Multi-channel   Sensor Data Fusion,"Feng Ye, Zhijie Xia, Min Dai, Zhisheng Zhang","Sensor signals acquired in the industrial process contain rich information which can be analyzed to facilitate effective monitoring of the process, early detection of system anomalies, quick diagnosis of fault root causes, and intelligent system design and control.

The multi-channel data has a high-dimensional and complex cross-correlation structure. It is crucial to develop a method that considers the interrelationships between different sensor channels. This paper proposes a new process monitoring approach based on uncorrelated multilinear discriminant analysis that can effectively model the multi-channel data to achieve a superior monitoring and fault diagnosis performance compared to other competing methods. The proposed method is applied directly to the high-dimensional tensorial data. Features are extracted and combined with multivariate control charts to monitor multi-channel data.

GP3: A Sampling-based Analysis Framework for Gaussian Processes,"Armin Lederer, Markus Kessler, Sandra Hirche","Although machine learning is increasingly applied in control approaches, only few methods guarantee certifiable safety, which is necessary for real world applications. These approaches typically rely on well-understood learning algorithms, which allow formal theoretical analysis. Gaussian process regression is a prominent example among those methods, which attracts growing attention due to its strong Bayesian foundations. Even though many problems regarding the analysis of Gaussian processes have a similar structure, specific approaches are typically tailored for them individually, without strong focus on computational efficiency. Thereby, the practical applicability and performance of these approaches is limited. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel framework called GP3, general purpose computation on graphics processing units for Gaussian processes, which allows to solve many of the existing problems efficiently. By employing interval analysis, local Lipschitz constants are computed in order to extend properties verified on a grid to continuous state spaces.

Building on previous work of the authors and of Junge, we show that the empirical distribution of points in such a process is always equidistributed under mild assumptions on the rule, generalizing work of Junge.   A major portion of this article is devoted to the study of a particular growth--fragmentation process, or cell process, which is a type of piecewise--deterministic Markov process (PDMP). This process represents a linearized version of a size--biased sampling from the $\Psi$--process.

We consider two different models of the particle displacement process: the undeviated uniform motion (when a particle moves with random constant velocity along a straight line) and the Brownian motion displacement.

Higher Order Derivative-Based Receiver Pre-processing for Molecular   Communications,"Mustafa Can Gursoy, Urbashi Mitra","While molecular communication via diffusion experiences significant inter-symbol interference (ISI), recent work suggests that ISI can be mitigated via time differentiation pre-processing which achieves pulse narrowing. Herein, the approach is generalized to higher order differentiation. The fundamental trade-off between ISI mitigation and noise amplification is characterized, showing the existence of an optimal derivative order that minimizes the bit error rate (BER). Theoretical analyses of the BER and a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are provided, the derivative order optimization problem is posed and solved for threshold-based detectors. For more complex detectors which exploit a window memory, it is shown that derivative pre-processing can strongly reduce the size of the needed window. Extensive numerical results confirm the accuracy of theoretical derivations, the gains in performance via derivative pre-processing over other methods and the impact of the optimal derivative order.

The posterior samples are transformed in the second step to satisfy the sparse structural assumption through the hard-thresholding function. This non-traditional Bayesian procedure is justified by showing that the post-processed posterior attains the optimal minimax rates. We also investigate the application of the post-processed posterior to the estimation of the global minimum variance portfolio. We show that the post-processed posterior for the global minimum variance portfolio also attains the optimal minimax rate under the sparse covariance assumption.

Here, we show how such context information can be integrated systematically into a deep neural network-based HAR system. Specifically, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a deep neural network-that estimates high-level movement descriptors, attributes, from the raw-sensor data-and a shallow classifier, which predicts activity classes from the estimated attributes and (optional) context information, like the currently executed process step. We empirically show that our proposed architecture increases HAR performance, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This formalism is applied to various types of Markov processes, namely discrete-time Markov chains, continuous-time Markov jump processes and diffusion processes in arbitrary dimension. In each setting, the time-additive observable is also fully general, i.e. it can involve both the time spent in each configuration and the elementary increments of the Markov process. The various cases are illustrated via simple explicit examples. Finally, we describe the link with the 'canonical conditioning' based on the generating function of the time-additive observable for finite time $T$, while the regime of large time $T$ allows to recover the standard large deviation analysis of time-additive observables via the deformed Markov operator approach.",2021-11-10T14:13:21Z,2022-01-21T07:32:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05696v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05696v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP, math.PR"

However existing algorithms can only be used if the target distribution of interest is differentiable everywhere. The key to adapting these algorithms so that they can sample from to densities with discontinuities is defining appropriate dynamics for the process when it hits a discontinuity. We present a simple condition for the transition of the process at a discontinuity which can be used to extend any existing sampler for smooth densities, and give specific choices for this transition which work with popular algorithms such as the Bouncy Particle Sampler, the Coordinate Sampler and the Zig-Zag Process. Our theoretical results extend and make rigorous arguments that have been presented previously, for instance constructing samplers for continuous densities restricted to a bounded domain, and we present a version of the Zig-Zag Process that can work in such a scenario.

Counterfactual Temporal Point Processes,"Kimia Noorbakhsh, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez","Machine learning models based on temporal point processes are the state of the art in a wide variety of applications involving discrete events in continuous time. However, these models lack the ability to answer counterfactual questions, which are increasingly relevant as these models are being used to inform targeted interventions. In this work, our goal is to fill this gap. To this end, we first develop a causal model of thinning for temporal point processes that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. This model satisfies a desirable counterfactual monotonicity condition, which is sufficient to identify counterfactual dynamics in the process of thinning. Then, given an observed realization of a temporal point process with a given intensity function, we develop a sampling algorithm that uses the above causal model of thinning and the superposition theorem to simulate counterfactual realizations of the temporal point process under a given alternative intensity function. Simulation experiments using synthetic and real epidemiological data show that the counterfactual realizations provided by our algorithm may give valuable insights to enhance targeted interventions.",2021-11-15T08:46:25Z,2022-05-20T07:44:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07603v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07603v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"
Pythia: Scheduling of Concurrent Network packet Processing Applications   on Heterogeneous Devices [EXTENDED VERSION],"Giannis Giakoumakis, Eva Papadogiannaki, Giorgos Vasiliadis, Sotiris Ioannidis","Modern commodity computing systems are composed by a number of different heterogeneous processing units, each of which has its own unique performance and energy characteristics. However, the majority of current network packet processing frameworks targets only a specific processing unit (either the CPU or accelerator), leaving the remaining computational resources under-utilized or even idle. In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheduling approach for network packet processing applications, that supports any heterogeneous and asymmetric architectures that can be found in a commodity high-end hardware setup. Our scheduler not only distributes the workloads to the appropriate devices in the system to achieve the desired performance results, but also enables the multiplexing of diverse network packet processing applications that execute concurrently, eliminating the interference effects introduced at runtime. The evaluation results show that our scheduler is able to tackle interferences in the shared hardware resources as well to respond quickly to dynamic fluctuations (e.g., application overloads, traffic bursts, infrastructural changes, etc.) that may occur at real time.",2022-01-05T12:55:36Z,2022-04-29T11:43:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01584v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01584v2,"cs.NI, cs.DC, cs.PF"
Opportunities of Hybrid Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Cell   Therapy Manufacturing Process Control,"Hua Zheng, Wei Xie, Keqi Wang, Zheng Li","Driven by the key challenges of cell therapy manufacturing, including high complexity, high uncertainty, and very limited process observations, we propose a hybrid model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently guide process control. We first create a probabilistic knowledge graph (KG) hybrid model characterizing the risk- and science-based understanding of biomanufacturing process mechanisms and quantifying inherent stochasticity, e.g., batch-to-batch variation. It can capture the key features, including nonlinear reactions, nonstationary dynamics, and partially observed state. This hybrid model can leverage existing mechanistic models and facilitate learning from heterogeneous process data. A computational sampling approach is used to generate posterior samples quantifying model uncertainty. Then, we introduce hybrid model-based Bayesian RL, accounting for both inherent stochasticity and model uncertainty, to guide optimal, robust, and interpretable dynamic decision making. Cell therapy manufacturing examples are used to empirically demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform the classical deterministic mechanistic model assisted process optimization.",2022-01-10T00:01:19Z,2022-01-26T04:36:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03116v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03116v2,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY"
Tooth Instance Segmentation on Panoramic Dental Radiographs Using U-Nets   and Morphological Processing,"Selahattin Serdar Helli, Andac Hamamci","Automatic teeth segmentation in panoramic x-ray images is an important research subject of the image analysis in dentistry. In this study, we propose a post-processing stage to obtain a segmentation map in which the objects in the image are separated, and apply this technique to tooth instance segmentation with U-Net network. The post-processing consists of grayscale morphological and filtering operations, which are applied to the sigmoid output of the network before binarization. A dice overlap score of 95.4 - 0.3% is obtained in overall teeth segmentation. The proposed post-processing stages reduce the mean error of tooth count to 6.15%, whereas the error without post-processing is 26.81%. The performances of both segmentation and tooth counting are the highest in the literature, to our knowledge. Moreover, this is achieved by using a relatively small training dataset, which consists of 105 images. Although the aim in this study is to segment tooth instances, the presented method is applicable to similar problems in other domains, such as separating the cell instances",2022-03-31T21:11:51Z,2022-03-31T21:11:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00095v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00095v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, I.4.6; J.3"
Robust and Efficient Parameter Estimation for Discretely Observed   Stochastic Processes,"Rohan Hore, Abhik Ghosh","In various practical situations, we encounter data from stochastic processes which can be efficiently modelled by an appropriate parametric model for subsequent statistical analyses. Unfortunately, the most common estimation and inference methods based on the maximum likelihood (ML) principle are susceptible to minor deviations from assumed model or data contamination due to their well known lack of robustness. Since the alternative non-parametric procedures often lose significant efficiency, in this paper, we develop a robust parameter estimation procedure for discretely observed data from a parametric stochastic process model which exploits the nice properties of the popular density power divergence measure in the framework of minimum distance inference. In particular, here we define the minimum density power divergence estimators (MDPDE) for the independent increment and the Markov processes. We establish the asymptotic consistency and distributional results for the proposed MDPDEs in these dependent stochastic process set-ups and illustrate their benefits over the usual ML estimator for common examples like Poisson process, drifted Brownian motion and auto-regressive models.",2022-04-11T11:56:26Z,2022-04-11T11:56:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05028v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05028v1,"stat.ME, math.ST, stat.TH"

(2) is completely different property from classical L\'evy processes. On the other hand, we find a free L\'evy process such that its marginal distribution is not unimodal for any time $s>0$ and its free L\'evy measure does not have a bounded support. Therefore, we conclude that the boundedness of the support of free L\'evy measure in (2) cannot be dropped.

Nonparametric Bayesian Topic Modelling with the Hierarchical Pitman-Yor   Processes,"Kar Wai Lim, Wray Buntine, Changyou Chen, Lan Du","The Dirichlet process and its extension, the Pitman-Yor process, are stochastic processes that take probability distributions as a parameter. These processes can be stacked up to form a hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian model. In this article, we present efficient methods for the use of these processes in this hierarchical context, and apply them to latent variable models for text analytics. In particular, we propose a general framework for designing these Bayesian models, which are called topic models in the computer science community. We then propose a specific nonparametric Bayesian topic model for modelling text from social media. We focus on tweets (posts on Twitter) in this article due to their ease of access.

To this end, we investigate sets of realisations of this process that agree with respect to a specific order of events and represent each such set by a rooted (binary) tree. The probability of each tree is, in turn, obtained by M\""obius inversion on a suitable poset of all rooted forests that can be obtained from the tree by edge deletion; we call this poset the \textit{pruning poset}.

In epidemiology, multistate models are employed to predict the evolution of real epidemics, while multistate models are used in the social sciences to study diverse opinions and complex phenomena such as segregation. In this paper, we introduce generalized approximation frameworks for the study and analysis of multistate dynamical processes on networks. These frameworks are degree-based, allowing for the analysis of the effect of network connectivity structures on dynamical processes. We illustrate the utility of our approach with the analysis of two specific dynamical processes from the epidemiological and physical sciences.

Memory equations as reduced Markov processes,"Artur Stephan, Holger Stephan","A large class of linear memory differential equations in one dimension, where the evolution depends on the whole history, can be equivalently described as a projection of a Markov process living in a higher dimensional space. Starting with such a memory equation, we propose an explicit construction of the corresponding Markov process. From a physical point of view the Markov process can be understood as a change of the type of some quasiparticles along one-way loops. Typically, the arising Markov process does not have the detailed balance property. The method leads to a more realistic modeling of memory equations. Moreover, it carries over the large number of investigation tools for Markov processes to memory equations, like the calculation of the equilibrium state, the asymptotic behavior and so on.

For this setup, we characterize the success probability of a typical link and the area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the network assuming slotted ALOHA as the channel access scheme. We then concretely establish that the success probability of a typical link in a VANET modeled using a Cox process converges to that of a 1D and 2D PPP for some extreme values of the line and node densities. We also study the trends in success probability as a function of the system parameters and show that the optimum transmission probability that maximizes the ASE for this Cox process model differs significantly from those of the relatively-simpler 1D and 2D PPP models used commonly in the literature to model vehicular networks.",2018-04-26T22:32:06Z,2018-04-26T22:32:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10298v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10298v1,"cs.IT, cs.NI, math.IT"

The properties of the STFT are fully characterized by window function, number of frequency channels, and time-shift. Thus, designing a better window is important for improving the performance of the processing especially when a less redundant T-F representation is desirable. While many window functions have been proposed in the literature, they are designed to have a good frequency response for analysis, which may not perform well in terms of signal processing. The window design must take the effect of the reconstruction (from the T-F domain into the time domain) into account for improving the performance. In this paper, an optimization-based design method of a nearly tight window is proposed to obtain a window performing well for the T-F domain signal processing.",2018-11-17T10:04:43Z,2019-02-04T12:15:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08783v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08783v2,"eess.SP, cs.SD, eess.AS"

This project presents a solution to this last problem by incorporating the process migration capability of MOSIX into Open-MPI and by reducing the resulting communication overhead.

Investigating the relationship between graph eigenvector ordering and   the signal processing dual,"Subbareddy Batreddy, S Sai Ashish, Aditya Siripuram","Graph signal processing uses the graph eigenvector basis to analyze signals. However, these graph eigenvectors are typically linearly ordered (by total variation), which may not be reasonable for many graph structures. There have been structure based similarity metrics proposed in the literature that better capture the geometry of graph eigenvectors. On the other hand, there has been work that attempts to generalize the concept of duality to graph signal processing. The (signal processing) the dual graph captures the relationship between graph frequencies and is obtained by typically inverting the graph Fourier transform operation. In this work, we investigate the connections between these two concepts. We propose a dualness measure of two graphs, which quantifies how close the graphs are being (signal processing) duals of each other. We show that this definition satisfies some desirable properties and develop an algorithm based on coordinate descent and perfect matching to compute an approximation to dualness.

Rejection of EEG artifacts is an essential process in EEG analysis since such artifacts cause many problems in EEG signals analysis. One of the most challenging issues in EEG denoising processes is removing the ocular artifacts where Electrooculographic (EOG), and EEG signals have an overlap in both frequency and time domains. In this paper, we build and train a deep learning model to deal with this challenge and remove the ocular artifacts effectively. In the proposed scheme, we convert each EEG signal to an image to be fed to a U-NET model, which is a deep learning model usually used in image segmentation tasks. We proposed three different schemes and made our U-NET based models learn to purify contaminated EEG signals similar to the process used in the image segmentation process. The results confirm that one of our schemes can achieve a reliable and promising accuracy to reduce the Mean square error between the target signal (Pure EEGs) and the predicted signal (Purified EEGs).",2020-09-12T23:28:12Z,2020-09-12T23:28:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08809v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08809v1,"eess.IV, cs.LG, eess.SP"
Parameter estimation in branching processes with almost sure extinction,"Peter Braunsteins, Sophie Hautphenne, Carmen Minuesa","We consider population-size-dependent branching processes (PSDBPs) which eventually become extinct with probability one. For these processes, we derive maximum likelihood estimators for the mean number of offspring born to individuals when the current population size is $z\geq 1$. As is standard in branching process theory, an asymptotic analysis of the estimators requires us to condition on non-extinction up to a finite generation $n$ and let $n\to\infty$; however, because the processes become extinct with probability one, we are able to demonstrate that our estimators do not satisfy the classical consistency property ($C$-consistency). This leads us to define the concept of $Q$-consistency, and we prove that our estimators are $Q$-consistent and asymptotically normal. To investigate the circumstances in which a $C$-consistent estimator is preferable to a $Q$-consistent estimator, we then provide two $C$-consistent estimators for subcritical Galton-Watson branching processes. Our results rely on a combination of linear operator theory, coupling arguments, and martingale methods.",2020-09-21T09:10:03Z,2020-09-21T09:10:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09695v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09695v1,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH"

Splitting Gaussian Process Regression for Streaming Data,"Nick Terry, Youngjun Choe","Gaussian processes offer a flexible kernel method for regression. While Gaussian processes have many useful theoretical properties and have proven practically useful, they suffer from poor scaling in the number of observations. In particular, the cubic time complexity of updating standard Gaussian process models make them generally unsuitable for application to streaming data. We propose an algorithm for sequentially partitioning the input space and fitting a localized Gaussian process to each disjoint region. The algorithm is shown to have superior time and space complexity to existing methods, and its sequential nature permits application to streaming data. The algorithm constructs a model for which the time complexity of updating is tightly bounded above by a pre-specified parameter. To the best of our knowledge, the model is the first local Gaussian process regression model to achieve linear memory complexity. Theoretical continuity properties of the model are proven. We demonstrate the efficacy of the resulting model on multi-dimensional regression tasks for streaming data.",2020-10-06T01:37:13Z,2020-10-06T01:37:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02424v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02424v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.ME"

We show how formatting a dataset in a certain way, can help make the process more efficient by eliminating the need for processing the clip for its whole duration, and still extract the features accurately. In addition, we discuss the possibility of defining set generic durations for analyzing a certain type of music clip while training. And in doing so we cut down the need of processing the clip duration to just 10% of the global average.",2020-10-07T03:35:39Z,2020-10-07T03:35:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03136v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03136v1,"cs.SD, cs.LG, eess.AS"

We observe that Propagation Blocking (PB), a software optimization designed for SpMV kernels, generalizes to many graph analytics kernels as well as common pre-processing tasks. In this work, we identify the lingering inefficiencies of a PB execution on conventional multicores and propose architecture support to eliminate PB's bottlenecks, further improving the performance gains from PB.

For many numerical computations it is essential to develop finite approximations for stochastic processes. While the goal is always to find a finite model, which represents a given knowledge about the real data process as accurate as possible, the ways of estimating the discrete approximating model may be quite different: (i) if the stochastic model is known as a solution of a stochastic differential equation, e.g., one may generate the scenario tree directly from the specified model; (ii) if a simulation algorithm is available, which allows simulating trajectories from all conditional distributions, a scenario tree can be generated by stochastic approximation; (iii) if only some observed trajectories of the scenario process are available, the construction of the approximating process can be based on non-parametric conditional density estimates.",2020-12-01T06:14:16Z,2020-12-01T06:14:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01185v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01185v1,"math.OC, stat.ML, 90C15, 60B05, 62P05"

On one hand this allows modellers to use appropriate boundary conditions with confidence when restricting the modelling domain. On the other hand it allows for numerical techniques based on differential equation solvers to obtain fast approximations of densities or other statistical properties of restricted one-sided L\'evy processes encountered, for example, in finance. In particular we identify a new nonlocal mass conserving boundary condition by showing it corresponds to fast-forwarding, i.e. removing the time the process spends outside the domain. We treat all combinations of killing, reflecting and fast-forwarding boundary conditions.   In Part I we show wellposedness of the backward and forward Cauchy problems with a one-sided pseudo-differential operator with boundary conditions as generator. We do so by showing convergence of Feller semigroups based on grid point approximations of the modified L\'evy process.   In Part II we show that the limiting Feller semigroup is indeed the semigroup associated with the modified L\'evy process by showing continuity of the modifications with respect to the Skorokhod topology.",2020-12-20T08:32:56Z,2020-12-20T08:32:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10864v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10864v1,"math.PR, math.AP, 35S15, 60J50, 60J35, 60G51, 60J27"

To further improve the processing ability of microwave pho-tonics, here, we have demonstrated a quantum microwave photonic processing system using a low jitter superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) and a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) module. This method uniquely combines extreme optical sensitivity, down to a single-photon level (below -100 dBm), and wide processing bandwidth, twice higher than the transmission bandwidth of the cable. Moreover, benefitted from the trigger, the system can selectively process the desired RF signal and attenuates the other in-tense noise and undesired RF components even the power is 15dB greater than the desired signal power. Using this method we show microwave phase shifting and frequency filtering for the desired RF signal on the single-photon level. Besides its applications in space and under-water communications and testing and qualification of pre-packaged photonic modulators and detectors.

"Explicit formulas for the inverses of Toeplitz matrices, with   applications",Akihiko Inoue,We derive novel explicit formulas for the inverses of truncated block Toeplitz matrices that correspond to a multivariate minimal stationary process. The main ingredients of the formulas are the Fourier coefficients of the phase function attached to the spectral density of the process. The derivation of the formulas is based on a recently developed finite prediction theory applied to the dual process of the stationary process. We illustrate the usefulness of the formulas by two applications. The first one is a strong convergence result for solutions of general block Toeplitz systems for a multivariate short-memory process. The second application is closed-form formulas for the inverses of truncated block Toeplitz matrices corresponding to a multivariate ARMA process. The significance of the latter is that they provide us with a linear-time algorithm to compute the solutions of corresponding block Toeplitz systems.,2021-05-03T20:45:38Z,2022-10-10T00:27:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01165v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01165v4,"math.FA, cs.NA, math.NA, math.PR, Primary 60G10, secondary 65F05, 60G25, 15B05"
Student-t Stochastic Volatility Model With Composite Likelihood   EM-Algorithm,"Raanju R. Sundararajan, Wagner Barreto-Souza","A new robust stochastic volatility (SV) model having Student-t marginals is proposed. Our process is defined through a linear normal regression model driven by a latent gamma process that controls temporal dependence. This gamma process is strategically chosen to enable us to find an explicit expression for the pairwise joint density function of the Student-t response process. With this at hand, we propose a composite likelihood (CL) based inference for our model, which can be straightforwardly implemented with a low computational cost. This is a remarkable feature of our Student-t SV process over existing SV models in the literature that involve computationally heavy algorithms for estimating parameters. Aiming at a precise estimation of the parameters related to the latent process, we propose a CL Expectation-Maximization algorithm and discuss a bootstrap approach to obtain standard errors. The finite-sample performance of our composite likelihood methods is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is motivated by an empirical application in the financial market.

Generalization is one of the quality criteria applied to process models to quantify how well the model describes future executions of the system. Generalization is also perhaps the least understood of those criteria, with that lack primarily a consequence of it measuring properties over the entire future behavior of the system when the only available sample of behavior is that provided by the log. In this paper, we apply a bootstrap approach from computational statistics, allowing us to define an estimator of the model's generalization based on the log it was discovered from. We show that standard process mining assumptions lead to a consistent estimator that makes fewer errors as the quality of the log increases.

A Distance Measure for Privacy-preserving Process Mining based on   Feature Learning,"Fabian R√∂sel, Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen, Han van der Aa, Matthias Weidlich","To enable process analysis based on an event log without compromising the privacy of individuals involved in process execution, a log may be anonymized. Such anonymization strives to transform a log so that it satisfies provable privacy guarantees, while largely maintaining its utility for process analysis. Existing techniques perform anonymization using simple, syntactic measures to identify suitable transformation operations. This way, the semantics of the activities referenced by the events in a trace are neglected, potentially leading to transformations in which events of unrelated activities are merged. To avoid this and incorporate the semantics of activities during anonymization, we propose to instead incorporate a distance measure based on feature learning. Specifically, we show how embeddings of events enable the definition of a distance measure for traces to guide event log anonymization. Our experiments with real-world data indicate that anonymization using this measure, compared to a syntactic one, yields logs that are closer to the original log in various dimensions and, hence, have higher utility for process analysis.",2021-07-14T09:44:28Z,2021-08-10T17:24:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06578v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06578v2,"cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.LG, H.4"

Our method, denoted ProcK (Process & Knowledge), relies not only on sequential input data in the form of event logs, but can learn to use a knowledge graph to incorporate information about the attribute values of the events and their mutual relationships. The idea is realized by mapping event attributes to nodes of a knowledge graph and training a sequence model alongside a graph neural network in an end-to-end fashion. This hybrid approach substantially enhances the flexibility and applicability of predictive process monitoring, as both the static and dynamic information residing in the databases of organizations can be directly taken as input data. We demonstrate the potential of ProcK by applying it to a number of predictive process monitoring tasks, including tasks with knowledge graphs available as well as an existing process monitoring benchmark where no such graph is given.

To this end, existing approaches add noise to the results of queries that extract properties of an event log, such as the frequency distribution of trace variants, for analysis.Noise insertion neglects the semantics of the process, though, and may generate traces not present in the original log. This is problematic. It lowers the utility of the published data and makes noise easily identifiable, as some traces will violate well-known semantic constraints.In this paper, we therefore argue for privacy preservation that incorporates a process semantics. For common trace-variant queries, we show how, based on the exponential mechanism, semantic constraints are incorporated to ensure differential privacy of the query result.

More specifically, we construct transfer functions with a full-rank input process formed from selected components of the given vector process and having a vector process of the remaining components as output. An important question, which we answer in the negative, is whether it is always possible to find such a deterministic relation that is stable. If it is unstable, there must be feedback from output to input ensuring that stationarity is maintained. This leads to connections to robust control. We also show how our results could be used to investigate the structure of dynamic network models and the latent low-rank stochastic process in a dynamic factor model.",2021-09-24T08:55:52Z,2023-04-13T06:16:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11814v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11814v5,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.DS, math.PR"

Orthogonally to this classification, the vast majority of works envisage the discovery task as a one-class supervised learning process guided by the traces that are recorded into an input log. In this work instead, we focus on declarative processes and embrace the less-popular view of process discovery as a binary supervised learning task, where the input log reports both examples of the normal system execution, and traces representing ""stranger"" behaviours according to the domain semantics. We therefore deepen how the valuable information brought by both these two sets can be extracted and formalised into a model that is ""optimal"" according to user-defined goals.

Efficient Volatility Estimation for L√©vy Processes with Jumps of   Unbounded Variation,"B. Cooper Boniece, Jos√© E.

One of the most well-known and widely studied problems is that of estimation of the quadratic variation of the continuous component of an It\^o semimartingale with jumps. Several rate- and variance-efficient estimators have been proposed in the literature when the jump component is of bounded variation. However, to date, very few methods can deal with jumps of unbounded variation. By developing new high-order expansions of the truncated moments of a L\'evy process, we construct a new rate- and variance-efficient estimator for a class of L\'evy processes of unbounded variation, whose small jumps behave like those of a stable L\'evy process with Blumenthal-Getoor index less than $8/5$. The proposed method is based on a two-step debiasing procedure for the truncated realized quadratic variation of the process.

Our result shows that the non-uniqueness of limiting distributions is closely related to the integrability of the Volterra convolution kernel. Using an extension of the exponential-affine transformation formula we also give the construction of stationary processes associated with the limiting distributions. Finally, we prove that the time marginals as well as the limiting distributions, when restricted to the interior of the state space $\mathbb{R}_{+}^m$, are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and their densities belong to some weighted Besov space of type $B_{1,\infty}^{\lambda}$.",2022-03-16T15:04:55Z,2022-10-08T12:02:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08677v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08677v3,"math.PR, q-fin.MF, Primary 60G22, Secondary 45D05, 91G20"

A number of our results match known results in random matrix theory, however our main result (regarding generalized singular values) seems to be more general than any of the standard random matrix processes (Hermite/Laguerre/Jacobi) in the field. To test this, we perform a series of simulations of this new process that, on the one hand, confirms that this process can exhibit behavior not seen in the standard random matrix processes, but on the other hand provides evidence that the true behavior is captured quite well by our techniques. This, coupled with the fact that we are able to compute the same statistics for this new model that we are for the standard models, suggests that further investigation could be both interesting and fruitful.",2022-05-01T15:37:10Z,2022-05-01T15:37:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00495v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00495v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.CO, math.MP"
A Contraction-constrained Model Predictive Control for Nonlinear   Processes using Disturbance Forecasts,"Ryan McCloy, Lai Wei, Jie Bao","Model predictive control (MPC) has become the most widely used advanced control method in process industry. In many cases, forecasts of the disturbances are available, e.g., predicted renewable power generation based on weather forecast. While the predictions of disturbances may not be accurate, utilizing the information can significantly improve the control performance in response to the disturbances. By exploiting process and disturbance models, future system behaviour can be predicted and used to optimise control actions via minimisation of an economical cost function which incorporates these predictions. However, stability guarantee of the resulting closed-loop system is often difficult in this approach when the processes are nonlinear. Proposed in the following article is a contraction-constrained predictive controller which optimises process economy whilst ensuring stabilisation to operating targets subject to disturbance measurements and forecasts.",2022-05-09T04:38:32Z,2022-06-07T01:23:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04033v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04033v2,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.OC"

"Optimal Multicast Service Chain Control: Packet Processing, Routing, and   Duplication","Yang Cai, Jaime Llorca, Antonia M. Tulino, Andreas F.

While such applications require timely processing of real-time streams that are simultaneously useful for multiple users/devices, existing technologies lack efficient mechanisms to handle their increasingly multicast nature, leading to unnecessary traffic redundancy and associated network congestion. In this paper, we address the design of distributed packet processing, routing, and duplication policies for optimal control of multicast stream-processing services. We present a characterization of the enlarged capacity region that results from efficient packet duplication, and design the first fully distributed multicast traffic management policy that stabilizes any input rate in the interior of the capacity region while minimizing overall operational cost.

Asymptotic analysis of dynamical systems driven by Poisson random   measures with periodic sampling,Shivam Singh Dhama,"In this article, we study the dynamics of a nonlinear system governed by an ordinary differential equation under the combined influence of fast periodic sampling with period $\delta$ and small jump noise of size $\varepsilon, 0< \varepsilon,\delta \ll 1.$ The noise is a combination of Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. The instantaneous rate of change of the state depends not only on its current value but on the most recent measurement of the state, as the state is measured at certain discrete-time instants. As $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0,$ the stochastic process of interest converges, in a suitable sense, to the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Next, the study of rescaled fluctuations of the stochastic process around its mean is found to vary depending on the relative rates of convergence of small parameters $\varepsilon, \delta$ in different asymptotic regimes. We show that the rescaled process converges, in a strong (path-wise) sense, to an effective process having an extra drift term capturing both the sampling and noise effect. Consequently, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process of interest, in terms of the effective process along with error bounds on the remainder.",2022-07-18T05:39:05Z,2024-11-26T23:56:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08388v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08388v2,"math.PR, math.DS, math.OC"

The text-based format has several advantages compared to flowsheet images regarding the storage format, computational accessibility, and eventually for data analysis and processing. However, the original SFILES version cannot describe essential flowsheet configurations unambiguously, such as the distinction between top and bottom products. Neither is it capable of describing the control structure required for the safe and reliable operation of chemical processes. Also, there is no publicly available software for decoding or encoding chemical process topologies to SFILES. We propose the SFILES 2.0 with a complete description of the extended notation and naming conventions. Additionally, we provide open-source software for the automated conversion between flowsheet graphs and SFILES 2.0 strings.

"A flexible, random histogram kernel for discrete-time Hawkes processes","Raiha Browning, Judith Rousseau, Kerrie Mengersen","Hawkes processes are a self-exciting stochastic process used to describe phenomena whereby past events increase the probability of the occurrence of future events. This work presents a flexible approach for modelling a variant of these, namely discrete-time Hawkes processes. Most standard models of Hawkes processes rely on a parametric form for the function describing the influence of past events, referred to as the triggering kernel. This is likely to be insufficient to capture the true excitation pattern, particularly for complex data. By utilising trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo inference techniques, our proposed model for the triggering kernel can take the form of any step function, affording significantly more flexibility than a parametric form. We first demonstrate the utility of the proposed model through a comprehensive simulation study. This includes univariate scenarios, and multivariate scenarios whereby there are multiple interacting Hawkes processes. We then apply the proposed model to several case studies: the interaction between two countries during the early to middle stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking Italy and France as an example, and the interaction of terrorist activity between two countries in close spatial proximity, Indonesia and the Philippines, and then within three regions of the Philippines.",2022-08-04T22:49:54Z,2022-08-04T22:49:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02921v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.02921v1,"stat.ME, stat.AP, stat.CO, 60G55, 62F15"
FRA-RIR: Fast Random Approximation of the Image-source Method,"Yi Luo, Jianwei Yu","The training of modern speech processing systems often requires a large amount of simulated room impulse response (RIR) data in order to allow the systems to generalize well in real-world, reverberant environments. However, simulating realistic RIR data typically requires accurate physical modeling, and the acceleration of such simulation process typically requires certain computational platforms such as a graphics processing unit (GPU). In this paper, we propose FRA-RIR, a fast random approximation method of the widely-used image-source method (ISM), to efficiently generate realistic RIR data without specific computational devices. FRA-RIR replaces the physical simulation in the standard ISM by a series of random approximations, which significantly speeds up the simulation process and enables its application in on-the-fly data generation pipelines. Experiments show that FRA-RIR can not only be significantly faster than other existing ISM-based RIR simulation tools on standard computational platforms, but also improves the performance of speech denoising systems evaluated on real-world RIR when trained with simulated RIR.

Equivalence of information production and generalized entropies in   complex processes,"Rudolf Hanel, Stefan Thurner","Complex systems that are characterized by strong correlations and fat-tailed distribution functions have been argued to be incompatible within the framework of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. As an alternative, so-called generalized entropies were proposed and intensively studied. Here we show that this incompatibility is a misconception. For a broad class of processes, Boltzmann entropy the log multiplicity remains the valid entropy concept, however, for non-i.i.d., non-multinomial, and non-ergodic processes, Boltzmann entropy is not of Shannon form. The correct form of Boltzmann entropy can be shown to be identical with generalized entropies. We derive this result for all processes that can be mapped reversibly to adjoint representations where processes are i.i.d.. In these representations the information production is given by the Shannon entropy. We proof that over the original sampling space this yields functionals that are identical to generalized entropies. The problem of constructing adequate context-sensitive entropy functionals therefore can be translated into the much simpler problem of finding adjoint representations.

The proposed approach for evaluation of multidimensional Walsh-Hadamard transform has a considerably lower computational complexity (involving $O(N^d)$ operations) in contrast to classical Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (involving $O(N^d~\log_2 N^d)$ operations), where $d$ and $N$ denote the number of dimensions and degrees of freedom along each dimension.

Lower and upper bounds of the superposition of renewal processes and   extensions,Shaomin Wu,"Consider a system consisting of multiple sockets into each of which a component is inserted. If a component fails, it is replaced immediately and system operation resumes. Then the failure process of the system is the superposition of renewal processes (or superimposed renewal process, SRP). If the label of the components that cause the system to fail are unknown but the times between failures are known, we refer to such data as {\it masked failure data}. To estimate the SRP based on masked failure data is challenging.   This paper obtains the lower and upper bounds of the rate of the SRP when only masked failure data are available. If repair (rather than replacement) is conducted on failed components, the failure process of the system is the superposition of generalized renewal processes (SGRPs). The paper then derives the lower and upper bounds of the rate of SGRPs and proposes to use a weighted linear combination of the bounds to approximate the SGRP. Discussions are provided for possible extensions of the bounds for systems with other structures such as parallel systems. An algorithm for simulating the SGRP is then proposed.

Mixtures of Gaussian Process Experts with SMC$^2$,"Teemu H√§rk√∂nen, Sara Wade, Kody Law, Lassi Roininen","Gaussian processes are a key component of many flexible statistical and machine learning models. However, they exhibit cubic computational complexity and high memory constraints due to the need of inverting and storing a full covariance matrix. To circumvent this, mixtures of Gaussian process experts have been considered where data points are assigned to independent experts, reducing the complexity by allowing inference based on smaller, local covariance matrices. Moreover, mixtures of Gaussian process experts substantially enrich the model's flexibility, allowing for behaviors such as non-stationarity, heteroscedasticity, and discontinuities. In this work, we construct a novel inference approach based on nested sequential Monte Carlo samplers to simultaneously infer both the gating network and Gaussian process expert parameters. This greatly improves inference compared to importance sampling, particularly in settings when a stationary Gaussian process is inappropriate, while still being thoroughly parallelizable.",2022-08-26T18:20:14Z,2022-08-26T18:20:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12830v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12830v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.CO"

Wormald conjectured in 1999 that, for d-regular degree sequences D_n, the final graph of this process is similar to a uniform random d-regular graph.

Towards an Ontology-Driven Approach for Process-Aware Risk Propagation,"Gal Engelberg, Mattia Fumagalli, Adrian Kuboszek, Dan Klein, Pnina Soffer, Giancarlo Guizzardi","The rapid development of cyber-physical systems creates an increasing demand for a general approach to risk, especially considering how physical and digital components affect the processes of the system itself. In risk analytics and management, risk propagation is a central technique, which allows the calculation of the cascading effect of risk within a system and supports risk mitigation activities. However, one open challenge is to devise a process-aware risk propagation solution that can be used to assess the impact of risk at different levels of abstraction, accounting for actors, processes, physical-digital objects, and their interrelations. To address this challenge, we propose a process-aware risk propagation approach that builds on two main components: i. an ontology, which supports functionalities typical of Semantic Web technologies (SWT), and semantics-based intelligent systems, representing a system with processes and objects having different levels of abstraction, and ii. a method to calculate the propagation of risk within the given system. We implemented our approach in a proof-of-concept tool, which was validated and demonstrated in the cybersecurity domain.",2022-12-22T14:56:41Z,2022-12-22T14:56:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11763v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11763v1,"cs.IT, cs.SE, math.IT"
The Sticky L√©vy Process as a solution to a Time Change Equation,"Miriam Ram√≠rez, Ger√≥nimo Uribe Bravo","Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) were originally devised by It\^o to provide a pathwise construction of diffusion processes. A less explored approach to represent them is through Time Change Equations (TCEs) as put forth by Doeblin. TCEs are a generalization of Ordinary Differential Equations driven by random functions. We present a simple example where TCEs have some advantage over SDEs.   We represent sticky L\'evy processes as the unique solution to a TCE driven by a L\'evy process with no negative jumps. The solution is adapted to the time-changed filtration of the L\'evy process driving the equation. This is in contrast to the SDE describing sticky Brownian motion, which is known to have no adapted solutions as first proved by Chitashvili. A known consequence of such non-adaptability for SDEs is that certain natural approximations to the solution of the corresponding SDE do not converge in probability, even though they do converge weakly. Instead, we provide strong approximation schemes for the solution of our TCE (by adapting Euler's method for ODEs), whenever the driving L\'evy process is strongly approximated.",2022-12-30T22:00:58Z,2023-01-03T16:46:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00063v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00063v2,"math.PR, math.CA, 60G51, 60G17, 34F05"
Shot-down stable processes,"Krzysztof Bogdan, Kajetan Jastrz»©bski, Moritz Kassmann, Micha≈Ç Kijaczko, Pawe≈Ç Pop≈Çawski","The shot-down process is a strong Markov process which is annihilated, or shot down, when jumping over or to the complement of a given open subset of a vector space. Due to specific features of the shot-down time, such processes suggest new type of boundary conditions for nonlocal differential equations. In this work we construct the shot-down process for the fractional Laplacian in Euclidean space. For smooth bounded sets $D$, we study its transition density and characterize Dirichlet form. We show that the corresponding Green function is comparable to that of the fractional Laplacian with Dirichlet conditions on $D$. However, for nonconvex $D$, the transition density of the shot-down stable process is incomparable with the Dirichlet heat kernel of the fractional Laplacian for $D$.",2023-01-28T20:08:30Z,2024-12-04T22:02:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12290v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12290v2,"math.PR, math.AP, math.FA, 35R09, 31C25 (primary), 60J35, 60J75 (secondary)"
Lag selection and estimation of stable parameters for multiple   autoregressive processes through convex programming,"Somnath Chakraborty, Johannes Lederer, Rainer von Sachs","Motivated by a variety of applications, high-dimensional time series have become an active topic of research. In particular, several methods and finite-sample theories for individual stable autoregressive processes with known lag have become available very recently. We, instead, consider multiple stable autoregressive processes that share an unknown lag. We use information across the different processes to simultaneously select the lag and estimate the parameters. We prove that the estimated process is stable, and we establish rates for the forecasting error that can outmatch the known rate in our setting. Our insights on the lag selection and the stability are also of interest for the case of individual autoregressive processes.",2023-03-03T17:57:04Z,2023-03-03T17:57:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02114v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02114v1,"math.ST, cs.LG, stat.ML, stat.TH"
Estimating Parameters of Large CTMP from Single Trajectory with   Application to Stochastic Network Epidemics Models,"Seyyed A. Fatemi, June Zhang","Graph dynamical systems (GDS) model dynamic processes on a (static) graph. Stochastic GDS has been used for network-based epidemics models such as the contact process and the reversible contact process. In this paper, we consider stochastic GDS that are also continuous-time Markov processes (CTMP), whose transition rates are linear functions of some dynamics parameters $\theta$ of interest (i.e., healing, exogeneous, and endogeneous infection rates). Our goal is to estimate $\theta$ from a single, finite-time, continuously observed trajectory of the CTMP. Parameter estimation of CTMP is challenging when the state space is large; for GDS, the number of Markov states are \emph{exponential} in the number of nodes of the graph. We showed that holding classes (i.e., Markov states with the same holding time distribution) give efficient partitions of the state space of GDS. We derived an upperbound on the number of holding classes for the contact process, which is polynomial in the number of nodes. We utilized holding classes to solve a smaller system of linear equations to find $\theta$. Experimental results show that finding reasonable results can be achieved even for short trajectories, particularly for the contact process. In fact, trajectory length does not significantly affect estimation error.",2023-03-15T02:19:26Z,2023-03-15T02:19:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08323v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08323v1,"stat.AP, math.DS, math.PR"
GenPhys: From Physical Processes to Generative Models,"Ziming Liu, Di Luo, Yilun Xu, Tommi Jaakkola, Max Tegmark","Since diffusion models (DM) and the more recent Poisson flow generative models (PFGM) are inspired by physical processes, it is reasonable to ask: Can physical processes offer additional new generative models? We show that the answer is yes. We introduce a general family, Generative Models from Physical Processes (GenPhys), where we translate partial differential equations (PDEs) describing physical processes to generative models. We show that generative models can be constructed from s-generative PDEs (s for smooth). GenPhys subsume the two existing generative models (DM and PFGM) and even give rise to new families of generative models, e.g., ""Yukawa Generative Models"" inspired from weak interactions. On the other hand, some physical processes by default do not belong to the GenPhys family, e.g., the wave equation and the Schr\""{o}dinger equation, but could be made into the GenPhys family with some modifications.

Putting Natural in Natural Language Processing,Grzegorz Chrupa≈Ça,"Human language is firstly spoken and only secondarily written. Text, however, is a very convenient and efficient representation of language, and modern civilization has made it ubiquitous. Thus the field of NLP has overwhelmingly focused on processing written rather than spoken language. Work on spoken language, on the other hand, has been siloed off within the largely separate speech processing community which has been inordinately preoccupied with transcribing speech into text. Recent advances in deep learning have led to a fortuitous convergence in methods between speech processing and mainstream NLP. Arguably, the time is ripe for a unification of these two fields, and for starting to take spoken language seriously as the primary mode of human communication. Truly natural language processing could lead to better integration with the rest of language science and could lead to systems which are more data-efficient and more human-like, and which can communicate beyond the textual modality.",2023-05-08T09:29:31Z,2023-05-23T14:15:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04572v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04572v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI, eess.AS"
Linked Deep Gaussian Process Emulation for Model Networks,"Deyu Ming, Daniel Williamson","Modern scientific problems are often multi-disciplinary and require integration of computer models from different disciplines, each with distinct functional complexities, programming environments, and computation times. Linked Gaussian process (LGP) emulation tackles this challenge through a divide-and-conquer strategy that integrates Gaussian process emulators of the individual computer models in a network. However, the required stationarity of the component Gaussian process emulators within the LGP framework limits its applicability in many real-world applications. In this work, we conceptualize a network of computer models as a deep Gaussian process with partial exposure of its hidden layers. We develop a method for inference for these partially exposed deep networks that retains a key strength of the LGP framework, whereby each model can be emulated separately using a DGP and then linked together. We show in both synthetic and empirical examples that our linked deep Gaussian process emulators exhibit significantly better predictive performance than standard LGP emulators in terms of accuracy and uncertainty quantification. They also outperform single DGPs fitted to the network as a whole because they are able to integrate information from the partially exposed hidden layers. Our methods are implemented in an R package $\texttt{dgpsi}$ that is freely available on CRAN.",2023-06-02T00:24:42Z,2023-06-02T00:24:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01212v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01212v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.CO, stat.ME"
Numerical Methods with Coordinate Transforms for Efficient Brownian   Dynamics Simulations,"Dominic Phillips, Charles Matthews, Benedict Leimkuhler","Many stochastic processes in the physical and biological sciences can be modelled as Brownian dynamics with multiplicative noise. However, numerical integrators for these processes can lose accuracy or even fail to converge when the diffusion term is configuration-dependent. One remedy is to construct a transform to a constant-diffusion process and sample the transformed process instead. In this work, we explain how coordinate-based and time-rescaling-based transforms can be used either individually or in combination to map a general class of variable-diffusion Brownian motion processes into constant-diffusion ones. The transforms are invertible, thus allowing recovery of the original dynamics. We motivate our methodology using examples in one dimension before then considering multivariate diffusion processes. We illustrate the benefits of the transforms through numerical simulations, demonstrating how the right combination of integrator and transform can improve computational efficiency and the order of convergence to the invariant distribution. Notably, the transforms that we derive are applicable to a class of multibody, anisotropic Stokes-Einstein diffusion that has applications in biophysical modelling.",2023-07-06T10:56:20Z,2024-04-19T11:00:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02913v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02913v3,"math.NA, cs.NA, 65C30"
Density fluctuations for the multi-species stirring process,"Francesco Casini, Cristian Giardin√†, Frank Redig","We study the density fluctuations at equilibrium of the multi-species stirring process, a natural multi-type generalization of the symmetric (partial) exclusion process. In the diffusive scaling limit, the resulting process is a system of infinite-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes that are coupled in the noise terms. This shows that at the level of equilibrium fluctuations the species start to interact, even though at the level of the hydrodynamic limit each species diffuses separately. We consider also a generalization to a multi-species stirring process with a linear reaction term arising from species mutation. The general techniques used in the proof are based on the Dynkin martingale approach, combined with duality for the computation of the covariances.",2023-07-11T08:41:45Z,2023-09-18T15:58:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05111v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05111v2,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"

Ergodicity of inhomogeneous Markov processes under general criteria,"Zhenxin Liu, Di Lu","This paper is concerned with ergodic properties of inhomogeneous Markov processes. Since the transition probabilities depend on initial times, the existing methods to obtain invariant measures for homogeneous Markov processes are not applicable straightforwardly. We impose some appropriate conditions under which invariant measure families for inhomogeneous Markov processes can be studied. Specifically, the existence of invariant measure families is established by either a generalization of the classical Krylov-Bogolyubov method or a Lyapunov criterion. Moreover, the uniqueness and exponential ergodicity are demonstrated under a contraction assumption of the transition probabilities on a large set. Finally, three examples, including Markov chains, diffusion processes and storage processes, are analyzed to illustrate the practicality of our method.",2023-07-24T18:34:50Z,2025-01-23T10:10:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13064v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13064v2,"math.PR, math.DS, 60B10, 60J25, 47D07, 60J10"
Mixed orthogonality graphs for continuous-time stationary processes,"Vicky Fasen-Hartmann, Lea Schenk","In this paper, we introduce different concepts of Granger causality and contemporaneous correlation for multivariate stationary continuous-time processes to model different dependencies between the component processes.

We then define two mixed graphs based on different definitions of Granger causality and contemporaneous correlation, the (mixed) orthogonality graph and the local (mixed) orthogonality graph. In these graphs, the components of the process are represented by vertices, directed edges between the vertices visualise Granger causal influences and undirected edges visualise contemporaneous correlation between the component processes. Further, we introduce various notions of Markov properties in analogy to Eichler (2012), which relate paths in the graphs to different dependence structures of subprocesses, and we derive sufficient criteria for the (local) orthogonality graph to satisfy them. Finally, as an example, for the popular multivariate continuous-time AR (MCAR) processes, we explicitly characterise the edges in the (local) orthogonality graph by the model parameters.",2023-08-17T09:54:42Z,2024-08-12T14:03:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08890v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08890v2,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH, 62H22, 62M10 (Primary) 62M20 (Secondary), G.3"
Benchmarking Domain Adaptation for Chemical Processes on the Tennessee   Eastman Process,"Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma, Michela Mulas, Fred Ngol√® Mboula, Francesco Corona, Antoine Souloumiac","In system monitoring, automatic fault diagnosis seeks to infer the systems' state based on sensor readings, e.g., through machine learning models. In this context, it is of key importance that, based on historical data, these systems are able to generalize to incoming data. In parallel, many factors may induce changes in the data probability distribution, hindering the possibility of such models to generalize. In this sense, domain adaptation is an important framework for adapting models to different probability distributions. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark, based on the Tennessee Eastman Process of Downs and Vogel (1993), for benchmarking domain adaptation methods in the context of chemical processes. Besides describing the process, and its relevance for domain adaptation, we describe a series of data processing steps for reproducing our benchmark. We then test 11 domain adaptation strategies on this novel benchmark, showing that optimal transport-based techniques outperform other strategies.",2023-08-22T07:43:59Z,2024-07-29T09:22:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11247v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11247v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Seismic Data Strong Noise Attenuation Based on Diffusion Model and   Principal Component Analysis,"Junheng Peng, Yong Li, Zhangquan Liao, Xuben Wang, Xingyu Yang","Seismic data noise processing is an important part of seismic exploration data processing, and the effect of noise elimination is directly related to the follow-up processing of data. In response to this problem, many authors have proposed methods based on rank reduction, sparse transformation, domain transformation, and deep learning. However, such methods are often not ideal when faced with strong noise. Therefore, we propose to use diffusion model theory for noise removal. The Bayesian equation is used to reverse the noise addition process, and the noise reduction work is divided into multiple steps to effectively deal with high-noise situations. Furthermore, we propose to evaluate the noise level of blind Gaussian seismic data using principal component analysis to determine the number of steps for noise reduction processing of seismic data. We train the model on synthetic data and validate it on field data through transfer learning. Experiments show that our proposed method can identify most of the noise with less signal leakage.

However, as the gap in THz-operating devices narrows, the demand for terabit-per-second (Tbps)-achieving circuits is increasing. Translating the available hundreds of gigahertz (GHz) of bandwidth into a Tbps data rate requires processing thousands of information bits per clock cycle at state-of-the-art clock frequencies of digital baseband processing circuitry of a few GHz. This paper addresses these constraints and emphasizes the importance of parallelization in signal processing, particularly for channel code decoding. By leveraging structured sub-spaces of THz channels, we propose mapping bits to transmission resources using shorter code-words, extending parallelizability across all baseband processing blocks. THz channels exhibit quasi-deterministic frequency, time, and space structures that enable efficient parallel bit mapping at the source and provide pseudo-soft bit reliability information for efficient detection and decoding at the receiver.",2023-09-27T21:06:14Z,2024-04-17T00:23:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16027v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16027v2,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"

Recently, it was shown that duality with respect to a death-like process implies that the filtering distributions are finite mixtures, making exact filtering and smoothing feasible through recursive algorithms with polynomial complexity in the number of observations. Here we provide general results for the case of duality between the diffusion and a regular jump continuous-time Markov chain on a discrete state space, which typically leads to filtering distribution given by countable mixtures indexed by the dual process state space. We investigate the performance of several approximation strategies on two hidden Markov models driven by Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Wright-Fisher diffusions, which admit duals of birth-and-death type, and compare them with the available exact strategies based on death-type duals and with bootstrap particle filtering on the diffusion state space as a general benchmark.",2023-10-01T07:20:59Z,2023-11-28T11:46:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00599v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00599v2,"math.PR, stat.CO, stat.ME"

To depict the strength of our approach, we derive a number of fundamental properties of Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting, such as: the It\^o lemma, the moment-generating function, the characteristic function, the explicit form of the probability density function, moments of all orders, various forms of the Fokker-Planck equation, infinitesimal generator of the process and its adjoint operator.

From this general inequality, we derive an upper law of the iterated logarithm for sub-$\psi$ vector-valued processes, which is tight up to small constants.

Such knowledge can be leveraged for improving the quality of predictions for exceptional process executions or when the process changes due to a concept drift. In this paper, we present a Symbolic[Neuro] system that leverages background knowledge expressed in terms of a procedural process model to offset the under-sampling in the training data.

Migdal-type effect in the dark matter absorption process,"V. A. Dzuba, V. V. Flambaum, I. B.

In this process, atom may be ionized upon absorption of a scalar particle through the scalar-nucleon Yukawa-type interaction. The crucial difference from the inelastic dark matter scattering on atoms is that the total energy of the particle, including its rest mass $mc^2$-term, is transferred to the electron. As a result, the emitted electron kinetic energy is about six orders in magnitude bigger than that in the dark matter scattering process. This absorption process allows one to probe dark matter particles with a relatively small mass, in the range from 1 to 100 keV, that cannot be detected in the scattering process. It is also possible to detect hypothetical scalar particles emitted from the Sun. We calculate absorption cross sections of this process in Na, Si, Ar, Ge, I, Xe, and Tl target atoms and extract limits on the scalar-nucleon interaction constant from null results of XENONnT experiment.",2023-12-17T00:15:10Z,2024-06-09T08:51:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10566v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10566v2,"hep-ph, hep-ex, physics.atom-ph"
Duality for the multispecies stirring process with open boundaries,"Francesco Casini, Rouven Frassek, Cristian Giardin√†","We study the stirring process with $N-1$ species on a generic graph $G=(V,\mathcal{E})$ with reservoirs. The multispecies stirring process generalizes the symmetric exclusion process, which is recovered in the case $N=2$. We prove the existence of a dual process defined on an extended graph $\widetilde{G}=(\widetilde{V},\widetilde{\mathcal{E})}$ which includes additional extra-sites $\widetilde{V}\setminus V$ where dual particles get absorbed in the long-time limit. We thus obtain a characterization of the non-equilibrium steady state of the boundary-driven system in terms of the absorption probabilities of dual particles. The process is integrable for the case of the one-dimensional chain with two reservoirs at the boundaries and with maximally one particle per site. We compute the absorption probabilities by relying on the underlying ${gl}(N)$ symmetry and the matrix product ansatz. Thus one gets a closed-formula for (long-ranged) correlations and for the non-equilibrium stationary measure.

Given the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML systems, understanding the ""black-box"" nature of these technologies has become increasingly critical. Focusing specifically on the domain of process mining, this paper delves into the challenges of interpreting ML models trained with complex business process data. We differentiate between intrinsically interpretable models and those that require post-hoc explanation techniques, providing a comprehensive overview of the current methodologies and their applications across various application domains. Through a rigorous bibliographic analysis, this research offers a detailed synthesis of the state of explainability and interpretability in predictive process mining, identifying key trends, challenges, and future directions.

Conditioning non-linear and infinite-dimensional diffusion processes,"Elizabeth Louise Baker, Gefan Yang, Michael L. Severinsen, Christy Anna Hipsley, Stefan Sommer","Generative diffusion models and many stochastic models in science and engineering naturally live in infinite dimensions before discretisation. To incorporate observed data for statistical and learning tasks, one needs to condition on observations. While recent work has treated conditioning linear processes in infinite dimensions, conditioning non-linear processes in infinite dimensions has not been explored. This paper conditions function valued stochastic processes without prior discretisation. To do so, we use an infinite-dimensional version of Girsanov's theorem to condition a function-valued stochastic process, leading to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the conditioned process involving the score. We apply this technique to do time series analysis for shapes of organisms in evolutionary biology, where we discretise via the Fourier basis and then learn the coefficients of the score function with score matching methods.",2024-02-02T14:26:32Z,2024-11-10T10:14:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01434v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01434v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.CO"
Processing Load Allocation of On-Board Multi-User Detection for   Payload-Constrained Satellite Networks,"Sirui Miao, Neng Ye, Peisen Wang, Qiaolin Ouyang","The rapid advance of mega-constellation facilitates the booming of direct-to-satellite massive access, where multi-user detection is critical to alleviate the induced inter-user interference. While centralized implementation of on-board detection induces unaffordable complexity for a single satellite, this paper proposes to allocate the processing load among cooperative satellites for finest exploitation of distributed processing power. Observing the inherent disparities among users, we first excavate the closed-form trade-offs between achievable sum-rate and the processing load corresponding to the satellite-user matchings, which leads to a system sum-rate maximization problem under stringent payload constraints. To address the non-trivial integer matching, we develop a quadratic transformation to the original problem, and prove it an equivalent conversion. The problem is further simplified into a series of subproblems employing successive lower bound approximation which obtains polynomial-time complexity and converges within a few iterations. Numerical results show remarkably complexity reduction compared with centralized processing, as well as around 20\% sum-rate gain compared with other allocation methods.",2024-03-06T11:47:05Z,2024-03-06T11:47:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03635v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03635v1,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"
Simulating conditioned diffusions on manifolds,"Marc Corstanje, Frank van der Meulen, Moritz Schauer, Stefan Sommer","To date, most methods for simulating conditioned diffusions are limited to the Euclidean setting. The conditioned process can be constructed using a change of measure known as Doob's $h$-transform. The specific type of conditioning depends on a function $h$ which is typically unknown in closed form. To resolve this, we extend the notion of guided processes to a manifold $M$, where one replaces $h$ by a function based on the heat kernel on $M$. We consider the case of a Brownian motion with drift, constructed using the frame bundle of $M$, conditioned to hit a point $x_T$ at time $T$. We prove equivalence of the laws of the conditioned process and the guided process with a tractable Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequently, we show how one can obtain guided processes on any manifold $N$ that is diffeomorphic to $M$ without assuming knowledge of the heat kernel on $N$. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations of guided processes and Bayesian parameter estimation based on discrete-time observations. For this, we consider both the torus and the Poincar\'e disk.",2024-03-08T16:08:34Z,2025-02-21T09:04:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05409v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05409v3,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 62R30, 60J60, 60J25"
A SysML Profile for the Standardized Description of Processes during   System Development,"Lasse Beers, Hamied Nabizada, Maximilian Weigand, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay","A key aspect in creating models of production systems with the use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) lies in the description of system functions. These functions shouldbe described in a clear and standardized manner.The VDI/VDE 3682 standard for Formalised Process De-scription (FPD) provides a simple and easily understandable representation of processes. These processes can be conceptualized as functions within the system model, making the FPD particularly well-suited for the standardized representation ofthe required functions. Hence, this contribution focuses on thedevelopment of a Domain-Specific Modeling Language(DSML) that facilitates the integration of VDI/VDE 3682 into the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The presented approach not onlyextends classical SysML with domain-specific requirements but also facilitates model verification through constraints modeled in Object Constraint Language (OCL). Additionally, it enables automatic serialization of process descriptions into the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Velocity Template Language (VTL). This serialization enables the use of process modeling in applications outside of MBSE.

Towards a Theoretical Foundation of Process Science,"Peter Fettke, Wolfgang Reisig","Process science is a highly interdisciplinary field of research. Despite numerous proposals, process science lacks an adequate understanding of the core concepts of the field, including notions such as process, event, and system. A more systematic framework to cope with process science is mandatory. We suggest such a framework using an example. The framework itself addresses three aspects: architecture, statics, and dynamics. Corresponding formal concepts, based on established scientific theories, together provide an integrated framework for understanding processes in the world. We argue that our foundations have positive implications not only for theoretical research, but also for empirical research, e.g., because hypothesized relationships can be explicitly tested.

Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion,"Jiayi Li, Ruilin Luo, Jiaqi Sun, Jing Xiao, Yujiu Yang","Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has emerged as a promising solution to address the issue of incompleteness within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Traditional KGC research primarily centers on triple classification and link prediction. Nevertheless, we contend that these tasks do not align well with real-world scenarios and merely serve as surrogate benchmarks. In this paper, we investigate three crucial processes relevant to real-world construction scenarios: (a) the verification process, which arises from the necessity and limitations of human verifiers; (b) the mining process, which identifies the most promising candidates for verification; and (c) the training process, which harnesses verified data for subsequent utilization; in order to achieve a transition toward more realistic challenges. By integrating these three processes, we introduce the Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion (PKGC) task, which simulates the gradual completion of KGs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to expedite PKGC processing, we propose two acceleration modules: Optimized Top-$k$ algorithm and Semantic Validity Filter. These modules significantly enhance the efficiency of the mining procedure. Our experiments demonstrate that performance in link prediction does not accurately reflect performance in PKGC. A more in-depth analysis reveals the key factors influencing the results and provides potential directions for future research.",2024-04-15T16:16:59Z,2024-04-15T16:16:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09897v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09897v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG"
PCA for Point Processes,"Franck Picard, Vincent Rivoirard, Angelina Roche, Victor Panaretos","We introduce a novel statistical framework for the analysis of replicated point processes that allows for the study of point pattern variability at a population level. By treating point process realizations as random measures, we adopt a functional analysis perspective and propose a form of functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) for point processes. The originality of our method is to base our analysis on the cumulative mass functions of the random measures which gives us a direct and interpretable analysis. Key theoretical contributions include establishing a Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion for the random measures and a Mercer Theorem for covariance measures. We establish convergence in a strong sense, and introduce the concept of principal measures, which can be seen as latent processes governing the dynamics of the observed point patterns. We propose an easy-to-implement estimation strategy of eigenelements for which parametric rates are achieved.

Parameter estimation and long-range dependence of the fractional   binomial process,"Meena Sanjay Babulal, Sunil Kumar Gauttam, Aditya Maheshwari","In 1990, Jakeman (see \cite{jakeman1990statistics}) defined the binomial process as a special case of the classical birth-death process, where the probability of birth is proportional to the difference between a fixed number and the number of individuals present. Later, a fractional generalization of the binomial process was studied by Cahoy and Polito (2012) (see \cite{cahoy2012fractional}) and called it as fractional binomial process (FBP). In this paper, we study second-order properties of the FBP and the long-range behavior of the FBP and its noise process. We also estimate the parameters of the FBP using the method of moments procedure.

Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes,"Aaron A. King, Qianying Lin, Edward L.

When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.",2024-05-27T10:39:18Z,2025-01-16T12:54:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17032v2,"q-bio.QM, math.PR, q-bio.PE, stat.AP"
New density/likelihood representations for Gibbs models based on   generating functionals of point processes,Ottmar Cronie,"Deriving exact density functions for Gibbs point processes has been challenging due to their general intractability, stemming from the intractability of their normalising constants/partition functions. This paper offers a solution to this open problem by exploiting a recent alternative representation of point process densities. Here, for a finite point process, the density is expressed as the void probability multiplied by a higher-order Papangelou conditional intensity function. By leveraging recent results on dependent thinnings, exact expressions for generating functionals and void probabilities of locally stable point processes are derived. Consequently, exact expressions for density/likelihood functions, partition functions and posterior densities are also obtained. The paper finally extends the results to locally stable Gibbsian random fields on lattices by representing them as point processes.",2024-06-11T09:02:06Z,2024-06-11T09:02:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07075v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07075v1,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.ME, stat.TH"
Decentralized Semantic Traffic Control in AVs Using RL and DQN for   Dynamic Roadblocks,"Emanuel Figetakis, Yahuza Bello, Ahmed Refaey, Abdallah Shami","Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), furnished with sensors capable of capturing essential vehicle dynamics such as speed, acceleration, and precise location, possess the capacity to execute intelligent maneuvers, including lane changes, in anticipation of approaching roadblocks. Nevertheless, the sheer volume of sensory data and the processing necessary to derive informed decisions can often overwhelm the vehicles, rendering them unable to handle the task independently. Consequently, a common approach in traffic scenarios involves transmitting the data to servers for processing, a practice that introduces challenges, particularly in situations demanding real-time processing. In response to this challenge, we present a novel DL-based semantic traffic control system that entrusts semantic encoding responsibilities to the vehicles themselves. This system processes driving decisions obtained from a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, streamlining the decision-making process. Specifically, our framework envisions scenarios where abrupt roadblocks materialize due to factors such as road maintenance, accidents, or vehicle repairs, necessitating vehicles to make determinations concerning lane-keeping or lane-changing actions to navigate past these obstacles. To formulate this scenario mathematically, we employ a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and harness the Deep Q Learning (DQN) algorithm to unearth viable solutions.",2024-06-26T20:12:48Z,2024-06-26T20:12:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18741v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18741v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NI"

Age and Value of Information Optimization for Systems with Multi-Class   Updates,"Ahmed Arafa, Roy D. Yates","Received samples of a stochastic process are processed by a server for delivery as updates to a monitor. Each sample belongs to a class that specifies a distribution for its processing time and a function that describes how the value of the processed update decays with age at the monitor. The class of a sample is identified when the processed update is delivered. The server implements a form of M/G/1/1 blocking queue; samples arriving at a busy server are discarded and samples arriving at an idle server are subject to an admission policy that depends on the age and class of the prior delivered update. For the delivered updates, we characterize the average age of information (AoI) and average value of information (VoI). We derive the optimal stationary policy that minimizes the convex combination of the AoI and (negative) VoI. It is shown that the policy has a threshold structure, in which a new sample is allowed to arrive to the server only if the previous update's age and value difference surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the specifics of the value function and system statistics.",2024-08-22T17:55:07Z,2024-08-22T17:55:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12589v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12589v1,"cs.IT, cs.NI, eess.SP, math.IT"
Multi-Output Distributional Fairness via Post-Processing,"Gang Li, Qihang Lin, Ayush Ghosh, Tianbao Yang","The post-processing approaches are becoming prominent techniques to enhance machine learning models' fairness because of their intuitiveness, low computational cost, and excellent scalability. However, most existing post-processing methods are designed for task-specific fairness measures and are limited to single-output models. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing method for multi-output models, such as the ones used for multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning, to enhance a model's distributional parity, a task-agnostic fairness measure. Existing techniques to achieve distributional parity are based on the (inverse) cumulative density function of a model's output, which is limited to single-output models. Extending previous works, our method employs an optimal transport mapping to move a model's outputs across different groups towards their empirical Wasserstein barycenter. An approximation technique is applied to reduce the complexity of computing the exact barycenter and a kernel regression method is proposed for extending this process to out-of-sample data. Our empirical studies, which compare our method to current existing post-processing baselines on multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",2024-08-31T22:41:26Z,2024-08-31T22:41:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00553v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00553v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY, stat.ML"
DANSE: Data-driven Non-linear State Estimation of Model-free Process in   Unsupervised Learning Setup,"Anubhab Ghosh, Antoine Honor√©, Saikat Chatterjee","We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet.

Point process model of 1/f noise versus a sum of Lorentzians,"B. Kaulakys, V. Gontis, M. Alaburda","We present a simple point process model of $1/f^{\beta}$ noise, covering different values of the exponent $\beta$. The signal of the model consists of pulses or events. The interpulse, interevent, interarrival, recurrence or waiting times of the signal are described by the general Langevin equation with the multiplicative noise and stochastically diffuse in some interval resulting in the power-law distribution. Our model is free from the requirement of a wide distribution of relaxation times and from the power-law forms of the pulses. It contains only one relaxation rate and yields $1/f^ {\beta}$ spectra in a wide range of frequency. We obtain explicit expressions for the power spectra and present numerical illustrations of the model. Further we analyze the relation of the point process model of $1/f$ noise with the Bernamont-Surdin-McWhorter model, representing the signals as a sum of the uncorrelated components. We show that the point process model is complementary to the model based on the sum of signals with a wide-range distribution of the relaxation times. In contrast to the Gaussian distribution of the signal intensity of the sum of the uncorrelated components, the point process exhibits asymptotically a power-law distribution of the signal intensity. The developed multiplicative point process model of $1/f^{\beta}$ noise may be used for modeling and analysis of stochastic processes in different systems with the power-law distribution of the intensity of pulsing signals.",2005-04-01T14:16:25Z,2005-04-01T14:16:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0504025v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0504025v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, astro-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.CE, math.ST, nlin.AO, physics.data-an, q-bio.NC, stat.TH"
Laws and Likelihoods for Ornstein Uhlenbeck-Gamma and other BNS OU   Stochastic Volatilty models with extensions,Lancelot F. James,"In recent years there have been many proposals as flexible alternatives to Gaussian based continuous time stochastic volatility models. A great deal of these models employ positive L\'evy processes. Among these are the attractive non-Gaussian positive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) in a series of papers. One current problem of these approaches is the unavailability of a tractable likelihood based statistical analysis for the returns of financial assets. This paper, while focusing on the BNS models, develops general theory for the implementation of statistical inference for a host of models. Specifically we show how to reduce the infinite-dimensional process based models to finite, albeit high, dimensional ones. Inference can then be based on Monte Carlo methods. As highlights, specific to BNS we show that an OU process driven by an infinite activity Gamma process, that is an OU-$\Gamma$, exhibits unique features which allows one to exactly sample from relevant joint distributions. We show that this is a consequence of the OU structure and the unique calculus of Gamma and Dirichlet processes. Owing to another connection between Gamma/Dirichlet processes and the theory of Generalized Gamma Convolutions (GGC) we identify a large class of models, we call (FGGC), where one can perfectly sample marginal distributions relevant to option pricing and Monte Carlo likelihood analysis.

On the correlation measure of a family of commuting Hermitian operators   with applications to particle densities of the quasi-free representations of   the CAR and CCR,"Eugene Lytvynov, Lin Mei","Let $X$ be a locally compact, second countable Hausdorff topological space. We consider a family of commuting Hermitian operators $a(\Delta)$ indexed by all measurable, relatively compact sets $\Delta$ in $X$ (a quantum stochastic process over $X$). For such a family, we introduce the notion of a correlation measure. We prove that, if the family of operators possesses a correlation measure which satisfies some condition of growth, then there exists a point process over $X$ having the same correlation measure. Furthermore, the operators $a(\Delta)$ can be realized as multiplication operators in the $L^2$-space with respect to this point process. In the proof, we utilize the notion of $\star$-positive definiteness, proposed in [Y. G. Kondratiev and T.\ Kuna, {\it Infin. Dimens. Anal. Quantum Probab. Relat. Top.} {\bf 5} (2002), 201--233]. In particular, our result extends the criterion of existence of a point process from that paper to the case of the topological space $X$, which is a standard underlying space in the theory of point processes. As applications, we discuss particle densities of the quasi-free representations of the CAR and CCR, which lead to fermion, boson, fermion-like, and boson-like (e.g. para-fermions and para-bosons of order 2) point processes.   In particular, we prove that any fermion point process corresponding to a Hermitian kernel may be derived in this way.",2006-08-14T12:27:32Z,2006-08-14T12:27:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608334v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0608334v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 47B15, 60G55, 81S05, 81S25"
Dynamics of a tagged particle in the asymmetric exclusion process with   the step initial condition,"T. Imamura, T.

We study the time evolution property of a tagged particle in TASEP with the step-type initial condition. Calculated is the multi-time joint distribution function of its position. Using the relation of the dynamics of TASEP to the Schur process, we show that the function is represented as the Fredholm determinant. We also study the scaling limit. The universality of the largest eigenvalue in the random matrix theory is realized in the limit. When the hopping rates of all particles are the same, it is found that the joint distribution function converges to that of the Airy process after the time at which the particle begins to move. On the other hand, when there are several particles with small hopping rate in front of a tagged particle, the limiting process changes at a certain time from the Airy process to the process of the largest eigenvalue in the Hermitian multi-matrix model with external sources.",2007-02-02T11:18:12Z,2007-07-06T09:01:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0702009v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0702009v4,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.MP, math.PR, nlin.SI"
Drift reversal in asymmetric coevolutionary conflicts: Influence of   microscopic processes and population size,Jens Christian Claussen,"The coevolutionary dynamics in finite populations currently is investigated in a wide range of disciplines, as chemical catalysis, biological evolution, social and economic systems. The dynamics of those systems can be formulated within the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not a priori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are not infinitely large. Whereas the replicator equation approach describes the infinite population size limit by deterministic differential equations, in finite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new effects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection in finite populations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts between two populations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was demonstrated, depending on the underlying microscopic process of the evolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears widely in biological coevolution, be it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as female and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift is calculated for the frequency-dependent Moran process and for different pairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown that the drift reversal cannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of individuals. Further, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not lead to a drift towards the internal fixed point. Hence the nonlinear comparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with its usage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of the mechanism.",2007-12-27T12:08:59Z,2007-12-27T12:08:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4224v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.4224v1,"q-bio.PE, physics.soc-ph, q-bio.QM"
Unveiling the mystery of visual information processing in human brain,Emanuel Diamant,"It is generally accepted that human vision is an extremely powerful information processing system that facilitates our interaction with the surrounding world. However, despite extended and extensive research efforts, which encompass many exploration fields, the underlying fundamentals and operational principles of visual information processing in human brain remain unknown. We still are unable to figure out where and how along the path from eyes to the cortex the sensory input perceived by the retina is converted into a meaningful object representation, which can be consciously manipulated by the brain. Studying the vast literature considering the various aspects of brain information processing, I was surprised to learn that the respected scholarly discussion is totally indifferent to the basic keynote question: ""What is information?"" in general or ""What is visual information?"" in particular. In the old days, it was assumed that any scientific research approach has first to define its basic departure points. Why was it overlooked in brain information processing research remains a conundrum. In this paper, I am trying to find a remedy for this bizarre situation. I propose an uncommon definition of ""information"", which can be derived from Kolmogorov's Complexity Theory and Chaitin's notion of Algorithmic Information. Embracing this new definition leads to an inevitable revision of traditional dogmas that shape the state of the art of brain information processing research. I hope this revision would better serve the challenging goal of human visual information processing modeling.",2008-07-02T12:33:48Z,2008-07-02T12:33:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0337v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0337v1,"cs.AI, cs.IR, cs.IT, math.IT, q-bio.NC"
Anisotropic Young diagrams and infinite-dimensional diffusion processes   with the Jack parameter,Grigori Olshanski,"We construct a family of Markov processes with continuous sample trajectories on an infinite-dimensional space, the Thoma simplex. The family depends on three continuous parameters, one of which, the Jack parameter, is similar to the beta parameter in random matrix theory. The processes arise in a scaling limit transition from certain finite Markov chains, the so called up-down chains on the Young graph with the Jack edge multiplicities. Each of the limit Markov processes is ergodic and its stationary distribution is a symmetrizing measure. The infinitesimal generators of the processes are explicitly computed; viewed as selfadjoint operators in the L^2 spaces over the symmetrizing measures, the generators have purely discrete spectrum which is explicitly described.   For the special value 1 of the Jack parameter, the limit Markov processes coincide with those of the recent work by Borodin and the author (Prob. Theory Rel. Fields 144 (2009), 281--318; arXiv:0706.1034). In the limit as the Jack parameter goes to 0, our family of processes degenerates to the one-parameter family of diffusions on the Kingman simplex studied long ago by Ethier and Kurtz in connection with some models of population genetics.   The techniques of the paper are essentially algebraic. The main computations are performed in the algebra of shifted symmetric functions with the Jack parameter and rely on the concept of anisotropic Young diagrams due to Kerov.",2009-02-19T15:47:05Z,2009-10-13T14:50:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3395v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.3395v3,"math.PR, math.CO, 60J60, 60C05, 60J10, 05E05"
Diffusivity bounds for 1D Brownian polymers,"Pierre Tarr√®s, B√°lint T√≥th, Benedek Valk√≥","We study the asymptotic behavior of a self-interacting one-dimensional Brownian polymer first introduced by Durrett and Rogers [Probab. Theory Related Fields 92 (1992) 337--349]. The polymer describes a stochastic process with a drift which is a certain average of its local time. We show that a smeared out version of the local time function as viewed from the actual position of the process is a Markov process in a suitably chosen function space, and that this process has a Gaussian stationary measure. As a first consequence, this enables us to partially prove a conjecture about the law of large numbers for the end-to-end displacement of the polymer formulated in Durrett and Rogers [Probab. Theory Related Fields 92 (1992) 337--349]. Next we give upper and lower bounds for the variance of the process under the stationary measure, in terms of the qualitative infrared behavior of the interaction function. In particular, we show that in the locally self-repelling case (when the process is essentially pushed by the negative gradient of its own local time) the process is super-diffusive.",2009-11-12T18:28:56Z,2012-06-08T10:46:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2356v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.2356v2,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 60K35, 60K37, 60K40 (Primary) 60F15, 60G15, 60J25, 60J55 (Secondary)"
Bessel processes and hyperbolic Brownian motions stopped at different   random times,"Mirko D'Ovidio, Enzo Orsingher","Iterated Bessel processes R^\gamma(t), t>0, \gamma>0 and their counterparts on hyperbolic spaces, i.e. hyperbolic Brownian motions B^{hp}(t), t>0 are examined and their probability laws derived. The higher-order partial differential equations governing the distributions of I_R(t)=_1R^\gamma(_2R^\gamma(t)), t>0 and J_R(t) =_1R^\gamma(|_2R^\gamma(t)|^2), t>0 are obtained and discussed. Processes of the form R^\gamma(T_t), t>0, B^{hp}(T_t), t>0 where T_t=\inf{s: B(s)=t} are examined and numerous probability laws derived, including the Student law, the arcsin laws (also their asymmetric versions), the Lamperti distribution of the ratio of independent positively skewed stable random variables and others. For the process R^{\gamma}(T^\mu_t), t>0 (where T^\mu_t = \inf{s: B^\mu(s)=t} and B^\mu is a Brownian motion with drift \mu) the explicit probability law and the governing equation are obtained. For the hyperbolic Brownian motions on the Poincar\'e half-spaces H^+_2, H^+_3 we study B^{hp}(T_t), t>0 and the corresponding governing equation.

On the estimation of integrated covariance matrices of high dimensional   diffusion processes,"Xinghua Zheng, Yingying Li","We consider the estimation of integrated covariance (ICV) matrices of high dimensional diffusion processes based on high frequency observations. We start by studying the most commonly used estimator, the realized covariance (RCV) matrix. We show that in the high dimensional case when the dimension $p$ and the observation frequency $n$ grow in the same rate, the limiting spectral distribution (LSD) of RCV depends on the covolatility process not only through the targeting ICV, but also on how the covolatility process varies in time. We establish a Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur type theorem for weighted sample covariance matrices, based on which we obtain a Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur type theorem for RCV for a class $\mathcal{C}$ of diffusion processes. The results explicitly demonstrate how the time variability of the covolatility process affects the LSD of RCV. We further propose an alternative estimator, the time-variation adjusted realized covariance (TVARCV) matrix. We show that for processes in class $\mathcal {C}$, the TVARCV possesses the desirable property that its LSD depends solely on that of the targeting ICV through the Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur equation, and hence, in particular, the TVARCV can be used to recover the empirical spectral distribution of the ICV by using existing algorithms.",2010-05-11T15:29:29Z,2012-03-13T08:38:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1862v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1862v4,"stat.ME, math.PR, math.ST, q-fin.ST, stat.TH"
Levy process simulation by stochastic step functions,"Torquil Macdonald S√∏rensen, Fred Espen Benth","We study a Monte Carlo algorithm for simulation of probability distributions based on stochastic step functions, and compare to the traditional Metropolis/Hastings method. Unlike the latter, the step function algorithm can produce an uncorrelated Markov chain. We apply this method to the simulation of Levy processes, for which simulation of uncorrelated jumps are essential.   We perform numerical tests consisting of simulation from probability distributions, as well as simulation of Levy process paths. The Levy processes include a jump-diffusion with a Gaussian Levy measure, as well as jump-diffusion approximations of the infinite activity NIG and CGMY processes.   To increase efficiency of the step function method, and to decrease correlations in the Metropolis/Hastings method, we introduce adaptive hybrid algorithms which employ uncorrelated draws from an adaptive discrete distribution defined on a space of subdivisions of the Levy measure space.   The nonzero correlations in Metropolis/Hastings simulations result in heavy tails for the Levy process distribution at any fixed time. This problem is eliminated in the step function approach. In each case of the Gaussian, NIG and CGMY processes, we compare the distribution at t=1 with exact results and note the superiority of the step function approach.",2011-10-11T13:23:51Z,2011-10-11T13:23:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2367v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.2367v1,"math.PR, physics.comp-ph, 60G51 (Primary) 65C05, 60G17, 62M10, 60J22, 60J75 (Secondary), G.3"
Stationary processes with pure point diffraction,"Daniel Lenz, Robert V. Moody","We consider the construction and classification of some new mathematical objects, called ergodic spatial stationary processes, on locally compact Abelian groups, which provide a natural and very general setting for studying diffraction and the famous inverse problems associated with it. In particular we can construct complete families of solutions to the inverse problem from any given pure point measure that is chosen to be the diffraction. In this case these processes can be classified by the dual of the group of relators based on the set of Bragg peaks, and this gives a solution to the homometry problem for pure point diffraction.   An ergodic spatial stationary process consists of a measure theoretical dynamical system and a mapping linking it with the ambient space in which diffracting density is supposed to exist. After introducing these processes we study their general properties and link pure point diffraction to almost periodicity.   Given a pure point measure we show how to construct from it and a given set of phases a corresponding ergodic spatial stationary process. In fact we do this in two separate ways, each of which sheds its own light on the nature of the problem. The first construction can be seen as an elaboration of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem, lifted from the domain of dynamical systems to that of stationary processes. The second is a Gelfand construction obtained by defining a suitable Banach algebra out of the putative eigenfunctions of the desired dynamics.",2011-11-15T19:38:28Z,2011-11-15T19:38:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3617v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.3617v1,"math-ph, math.MP, 28D05, 47A35, 11K70"
"A queueing model with independent arrivals, and its fluid and diffusion   limits","Harsha Honnappa, Rahul Jain, Amy R. Ward","We introduce the {\Delta}(i)/GI/1 queue, a new queueing model. In this model, customers from a given population independently sample a time to arrive from some given distribution F. Thus, the arrival times are an ordered statistics, and the inter-arrival times are differences of consecutive ordered statistics. They are served by a single server which provides service according to a general distribution G, with independent service times. The exact model is analytically intractable. Thus, we develop fluid and diffusion limits for the various stochastic processes, and performance metrics. The fluid limit of the queue length is observed to be a reflected process, while the diffusion limit is observed to be a function of a Brownian motion and a Brownian bridge process, and is given by a 'netput' process and a directional derivative of the Skorokhod reflected fluid netput in the direction of a diffusion refinement of the netput process. We also observe what may be interpreted as a transient Little's law. Sample path analysis reveals various operating regimes where the diffusion limit switches between a free diffusion, a reflected diffusion process and the zero process, with possible discontinuities during regime switches. The weak convergence is established in the M1 topology, and it is also shown that this is not possible in the J1 topology.",2012-06-04T19:44:03Z,2014-12-07T05:32:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0720v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.0720v2,"math.PR, cs.SY, 60K25, 90B15 (Primary) 68M20, 90B22 (Secondary)"
Gaussian approximation of suprema of empirical processes,"Victor Chernozhukov, Denis Chetverikov, Kengo Kato","This paper develops a new direct approach to approximating suprema of general empirical processes by a sequence of suprema of Gaussian processes, without taking the route of approximating whole empirical processes in the sup-norm. We prove an abstract approximation theorem applicable to a wide variety of statistical problems, such as construction of uniform confidence bands for functions. Notably, the bound in the main approximation theorem is nonasymptotic and the theorem allows for functions that index the empirical process to be unbounded and have entropy divergent with the sample size. The proof of the approximation theorem builds on a new coupling inequality for maxima of sums of random vectors, the proof of which depends on an effective use of Stein's method for normal approximation, and some new empirical process techniques. We study applications of this approximation theorem to local and series empirical processes arising in nonparametric estimation via kernel and series methods, where the classes of functions change with the sample size and are non-Donsker. Importantly, our new technique is able to prove the Gaussian approximation for the supremum type statistics under weak regularity conditions, especially concerning the bandwidth and the number of series functions, in those examples.",2012-12-31T13:03:45Z,2014-08-17T07:00:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6885v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.6885v6,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
Assessment of stochastic and deterministic models of 6304 quasar   lightcurves from SDSS Stripe 82,"Rene Andrae, Dae-Won Kim, Coryn A. L. Bailer-Jones","The optical light curves of many quasars show variations of tenths of a magnitude or more on time scales of months to years. This variation often cannot be described well by a simple deterministic model. We perform a Bayesian comparison of over 20 deterministic and stochastic models on 6304 QSO light curves in SDSS Stripe 82. We include the damped random walk (or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck [OU] process), a particular type of stochastic model which recent studies have focused on. Further models we consider are single and double sinusoids, multiple OU processes, higher order continuous autoregressive processes, and composite models. We find that only 29 out of 6304 QSO lightcurves are described significantly better by a deterministic model than a stochastic one. The OU process is an adequate description of the vast majority of cases (6023). Indeed, the OU process is the best single model for 3462 light curves, with the composite OU process/sinusoid model being the best in 1706 cases. The latter model is the dominant one for brighter/bluer QSOs. Furthermore, a non-negligible fraction of QSO lightcurves show evidence that not only the mean is stochastic but the variance is stochastic, too. Our results confirm earlier work that QSO light curves can be described with a stochastic model, but place this on a firmer footing, and further show that the OU process is preferred over several other stochastic and deterministic models. Of course, there may well exist yet better (deterministic or stochastic) models which have not been considered here.",2013-04-10T07:30:46Z,2013-04-10T07:30:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2863v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2863v1,"astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, stat.AP"
Bayesian Structural Inference for Hidden Processes,"Christopher C. Strelioff, James P. Crutchfield","We introduce a Bayesian approach to discovering patterns in structurally complex processes. The proposed method of Bayesian Structural Inference (BSI) relies on a set of candidate unifilar HMM (uHMM) topologies for inference of process structure from a data series. We employ a recently developed exact enumeration of topological epsilon-machines. (A sequel then removes the topological restriction.) This subset of the uHMM topologies has the added benefit that inferred models are guaranteed to be epsilon-machines, irrespective of estimated transition probabilities. Properties of epsilon-machines and uHMMs allow for the derivation of analytic expressions for estimating transition probabilities, inferring start states, and comparing the posterior probability of candidate model topologies, despite process internal structure being only indirectly present in data. We demonstrate BSI's effectiveness in estimating a process's randomness, as reflected by the Shannon entropy rate, and its structure, as quantified by the statistical complexity. We also compare using the posterior distribution over candidate models and the single, maximum a posteriori model for point estimation and show that the former more accurately reflects uncertainty in estimated values. We apply BSI to in-class examples of finite- and infinite-order Markov processes, as well to an out-of-class, infinite-state hidden process.",2013-09-05T16:18:35Z,2013-12-09T05:21:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1392v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1392v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST, nlin.CD, physics.data-an, stat.TH"
Efficiency of cellular information processing,"Andre C. Barato, David Hartich, Udo Seifert","We show that a rate of conditional Shannon entropy reduction, characterizing the learning of an internal process about an external process, is bounded by the thermodynamic entropy production. This approach allows for the definition of an informational efficiency that can be used to study cellular information processing. We analyze three models of increasing complexity inspired by the E. coli sensory network, where the external process is an external ligand concentration jumping between two values. We start with a simple model for which ATP must be consumed so that a protein inside the cell can learn about the external concentration. With a second model for a single receptor we show that the rate at which the receptor learns about the external environment can be nonzero even without any dissipation inside the cell since chemical work done by the external process compensates for this learning rate. The third model is more complete, also containing adaptation. For this model we show inter alia that a bacterium in an environment that changes at a very slow time-scale is quite inefficient, dissipating much more than it learns. Using the concept of a coarse-grained learning rate, we show for the model with adaptation that while the activity learns about the external signal the option of changing the methylation level increases the concentration range for which the learning rate is substantial.",2014-05-28T13:56:09Z,2014-11-06T18:11:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7241v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7241v2,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.SC"
The Shark Fin Function - Asymptotic Behavior of the Filtered Derivative   for Point Processes in Case of Change Points,"Michael Messer, Gaby Schneider","A multiple filter test (MFT) for the analysis and detection of rate change points in point processes on the line has been proposed recently. The underlying statistical test investigates the null hypothesis of constant rate. For that purpose, multiple filtered derivative processes are observed simultaneously. Under the null hypothesis, each process $G$ asymptotically takes the form \begin{align*} G \sim L, \end{align*} while $L$ is a zero-mean Gaussian process with unit variance. This result is used to derive a rejection threshold for statistical hypothesis testing.   The purpose of this paper is to describe the behavior of $G$ under the alternative hypothesis of rate changes and potential simultaneous variance changes. We derive the approximation \begin{align*} G \sim \Delta \cdot\left(\Lambda + L\right), \end{align*} with deterministic functions $\Delta$ and $\Lambda$. The function $\Lambda$ accounts for the systematic deviation of $G$ in the neighborhood of a change point. When only the rate changes, $\Lambda$ is hat shaped. When also the variance changes, $\Lambda$ takes the form of a shark's fin. In addition, the parameter estimates required in practical application are not consistent in the neighborhood of a change point. Therefore, we derive the factor $\Delta$ termed here the distortion function. It accounts for the lack in consistency and describes the local parameter estimating process relative to the true scaling of the filtered derivative process.",2014-09-03T10:30:10Z,2016-05-17T12:34:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1025v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1025v3,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62M09, 62M10, 60G35, 60K05"
Variance reduction for irreversible Langevin samplers and diffusion on   graphs,"Luc Rey-Bellet, Konstantinos Spiliopoulos","In recent papers it has been demonstrated that sampling a Gibbs distribution from an appropriate time-irreversible Langevin process is, from several points of view, advantageous when compared to sampling from a time-reversible one. Adding an appropriate irreversible drift to the overdamped Langevin equation results in a larger large deviations rate function for the empirical measure of the process, a smaller variance for the long time average of observables of the process, as well as a larger spectral gap. In this work, we concentrate on irreversible Langevin samplers with a drift of increasing intensity. The asymptotic variance is monotonically decreasing with respect to the growth of the drift and we characterize its limiting behavior. For a Gibbs measure whose potential has one or more critical points, adding a large irreversible drift results in a decomposition of the process in a slow and fast component with fast motion along the level sets of the potential and slow motion in the orthogonal direction. This result helps understanding the variance reduction, which can be explained at the process level by the induced fast motion of the process along the level sets of the potential. The limit of the asymptotic variance as the magnitude of the irreversible perturbation grows is the asymptotic variance associated to the limiting slow motion. The latter is a diffusion process on a graph.",2014-10-01T15:08:54Z,2015-02-18T21:27:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0255v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0255v3,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 60F05, 60F10, 60J25, 60J60, 65C05, 82B80"

More specifically, we consider a class of nonlinear, partially observable stochastic systems, comprised by a (possibly nonstationary) hidden stochastic process (the state), observed through another conditionally Gaussian stochastic process (the observations). Under general assumptions, we show that, given an approximating process which, for each time step, is stochastically convergent to the state process, an approximate filtering operator can be defined, which converges to the true optimal nonlinear filter of the state in a strong and well defined sense. In particular, the convergence is compact in time and uniform in a completely characterized measurable set of probability measure almost unity, also providing a purely quantitative justification of Egoroff's Theorem for the problem at hand.

Impact of degree truncation on the spread of a contagious process on   networks,"Guy Harling, Jukka-Pekka Onnela","Understanding how person-to-person contagious processes spread through a population requires accurate information on connections between population members. However, such connectivity data, when collected via interview, is often incomplete due to partial recall, respondent fatigue or study design, e.g., fixed choice designs (FCD) truncate out-degree by limiting the number of contacts each respondent can report. Past research has shown how FCD truncation affects network properties, but its implications for predicted speed and size of spreading processes remain largely unexplored. To study the impact of degree truncation on spreading processes, we generated collections of synthetic networks containing specific properties (degree distribution, degree-assortativity, clustering), and also used empirical social network data from 75 villages in Karnataka, India. We simulated FCD using various truncation thresholds and ran a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) process on each network. We found that spreading processes propagated on truncated networks resulted in slower and smaller epidemics, with a sudden decrease in prediction accuracy at a level of truncation that varied by network type. Our results have implications beyond FCD to truncation due to any limited sampling from a larger network. We conclude that knowledge of network structure is important for understanding the accuracy of predictions of process spread on degree truncated networks.",2016-02-10T16:33:33Z,2016-02-10T16:33:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03434v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03434v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI, stat.OT"
Crystal nucleation as the ordering of multiple order parameters,"John Russo, Hajime Tanaka","Nucleation is an activated process in which the system has to overcome a free energy barrier in order for a first-order phase transition between the metastable and the stable phases to take place. In the liquid-to-solid transition the process occurs between phases of different symmetry, and it is thus inherently a multi-dimensional process, in which all symmetries are broken at the transition. In this Focus Article, we consider some recent studies which highlight the multi-dimensional nature of the nucleation process. Even for a single-component system, the formation of solid crystals from the metastable melt involves fluctuations of two (or more) order parameters, often associated with the decoupling of positional and orientational symmetry breaking. In other words, we need at least two order parameters to describe the free-energy of a system including its liquid and crystalline states. This decoupling occurs naturally for asymmetric particles or directional interactions, focusing here on the case of water, but we will show that it also affects spherically symmetric interacting particles, such as the hard-sphere system. We will show how the treatment of nucleation as a multi-dimensional process has shed new light on the process of polymorph selection, on the effect of external fields on the nucleation process, and on glass-forming ability.",2016-11-24T00:14:14Z,2016-11-24T00:14:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08041v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08041v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.stat-mech"

An image containing black and white pixels is first converted to voltage states and then mapped into the magnetization states of a nanomagnet array with magneto-tunneling junctions (MTJs).

Dipole interaction between the nanomagnets implements specific image processing tasks such as noise reduction and edge enhancement detection.

Reconfigurable Broadcast Networks and Asynchronous Shared-Memory Systems   are Equivalent (Long Version),"A. R. Balasubramanian, Chana Weil-Kennedy","We show the equivalence of two distributed computing models, namely reconfigurable broadcast networks (RBN) and asynchronous shared-memory systems (ASMS), that were introduced independently. Both RBN and ASMS are systems in which a collection of anonymous, finite-state processes run the same protocol. In RBN, the processes communicate by selective broadcast: a process can broadcast a message which is received by all of its neighbors, and the set of neighbors of a process can change arbitrarily over time. In ASMS, the processes communicate by shared memory: a process can either write to or read from a shared register. Our main result is that RBN and ASMS can simulate each other, i.e. they are equivalent with respect to parameterized reachability, where we are given two (possibly infinite) sets of configurations C and C' defined by upper and lower bounds on the number of processes in each state and we would like to decide if some configuration in C can reach some configuration in C'. Using this simulation equivalence, we transfer results of RBN to ASMS and vice versa. Finally, we show that RBN and ASMS can simulate a third distributed model called immediate observation (IO) nets. Moreover, for a slightly stronger notion of simulation (which is satisfied by all the simulations given in this paper), we show that IO nets cannot simulate RBN.",2021-08-17T08:52:36Z,2021-08-26T12:32:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07510v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07510v2,"cs.LO, cs.DC, cs.MA"
Full Characterization of Adaptively Strong Majority Voting in   Crowdsourcing,"Margarita Boyarskaya, Panos Ipeirotis","In crowdsourcing, quality control is commonly achieved by having workers examine items and vote on their correctness. To minimize the impact of unreliable worker responses, a $\delta$-margin voting process is utilized, where additional votes are solicited until a predetermined threshold $\delta$ for agreement between workers is exceeded. The process is widely adopted but only as a heuristic. Our research presents a modeling approach using absorbing Markov chains to analyze the characteristics of this voting process that matter in crowdsourced processes. We provide closed-form equations for the quality of resulting consensus vote, the expected number of votes required for consensus, the variance of vote requirements, and other distribution moments. Our findings demonstrate how the threshold $\delta$ can be adjusted to achieve quality equivalence across voting processes that employ workers with varying accuracy levels. We also provide efficiency-equalizing payment rates for voting processes with different expected response accuracy levels. Additionally, our model considers items with varying degrees of difficulty and uncertainty about the difficulty of each example. Our simulations, using real-world crowdsourced vote data, validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model in characterizing the consensus aggregation process. The results of our study can be effectively employed in practical crowdsourcing applications.",2021-11-11T18:58:09Z,2024-04-25T18:31:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06390v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06390v3,"stat.AP, cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.HC"
Solving Inverse Problems in Medical Imaging with Score-Based Generative   Models,"Yang Song, Liyue Shen, Lei Xing, Stefano Ermon","Reconstructing medical images from partial measurements is an important inverse problem in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes.",2021-11-15T05:41:12Z,2022-06-16T00:01:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08005v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08005v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ML"
The Power of Filling in Balanced Allocations,"Dimitrios Los, Thomas Sauerwald, John Sylvester","We introduce a new class of balanced allocation processes which are primarily characterized by ``filling'' underloaded bins. A prototypical example is the Packing process: At each round we only take one bin sample, if the load is below the average load, then we place as many balls until the average load is reached; otherwise, we place only one ball. We prove that for any process in this class the gap between the maximum and average load is $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ w.h.p. for any number of balls $m\geq 1$. For the Packing process, we also provide a matching lower bound. Additionally, we prove that the Packing process is sample-efficient in the sense that the expected number of balls allocated per sample is strictly greater than one. Finally, we also demonstrate that the upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ on the gap can be extended to the Memory process studied by Mitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah (2002).",2022-04-08T13:21:54Z,2023-08-28T15:19:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04057v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04057v3,"cs.DM, cs.DS, math.CO, math.PR, 68W20, 68W27, 68W40, 60C05, G.3; G.2.m; F.2.2"
On the Kolmogorov--Wiener--Masani spectrum of a multi-mode weakly   stationary quantum process,"K. R. Parthasarathy, Ritabrata Sengupta","We introduce the notion of a $k$-mode weakly stationary quantum process $\varrho$ based on the canonical Schr\""odinger pairs of position and momentum observables in copies of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$, indexed by an additive abelian group $D$ of countable cardinality. Such observables admit an autocovariance map $\widetilde{K}$ from $D$ into the space of real $2k \times 2k$ matrices. The map $\widetilde{K}$ on the discrete group $D$ admits a spectral representation as the Fourier transform of a $2k \times 2k$ complex Hermitain matrix-valued totally finite measure $\Phi$ on the compact character group $\widehat{D}$, called the Kolmogorov-Wiener-Masani (KWM) spectrum of the process $\varrho$. Necessary and sufficient conditions on a $2k \times 2k$ complex Hermitian matrix-valued measure $\Phi$ on $\widehat{D}$ to be the KWM spectrum of a process $\varrho$ are obtained. This enables the construction of examples. Our theorem reveals the dramatic influence of the uncertainty relations among the position and momentum observables on the KWM spectrum of the process $\varrho$. In particular, KWM spectrum cannot admit a gap of positive Haar measure in $\widehat{D}$.   The relationship between the number of photons in a particular mode at any site of the process and its KWM spectrum needs further investigation.",2016-05-20T10:40:18Z,2016-06-27T06:55:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06278v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06278v2,"quant-ph, math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 81S25, 60G25, 60G10"
Random walks in non homogeneous Poissonian environment,"Youri Davydov, Valentin Konakov","We consider the moving particle process in Rd which is defined in the following way. There are two independent sequences (Tk) and (dk) of random variables. The variables Tk are non negative and form an increasing sequence, while variables dk form an i.i.d sequence with common distribution concentrated on the unit sphere. The values dk are interpreted as the directions, and Tk as the moments of change of directions. A particle starts from zero and moves in the direction d1 up to the moment T1 . It then changes direction to d2 and moves on within the time interval T2 minus T1 , etc. The speed is constant at all sites. The position of the particle at time t is denoted by X(t). We suppose that the points (Tk) form a non homogeneous Poisson point process and we are interested in the global behavior of the process (X(t)), namely, we are looking for conditions under which the processes (Y(T,t), T is non negative), Y(T,t) is X(tT) normalized by B(T), t in (0, 1), weakly converges in C(0, 1) to some process Y when T tends to infinity.

Scalable L√©vy Process Priors for Spectral Kernel Learning,"Phillip A. Jang, Andrew E. Loeb, Matthew B. Davidow, Andrew Gordon Wilson","Gaussian processes are rich distributions over functions, with generalization properties determined by a kernel function. When used for long-range extrapolation, predictions are particularly sensitive to the choice of kernel parameters. It is therefore critical to account for kernel uncertainty in our predictive distributions. We propose a distribution over kernels formed by modelling a spectral mixture density with a L\'evy process. The resulting distribution has support for all stationary covariances--including the popular RBF, periodic, and Mat\'ern kernels--combined with inductive biases which enable automatic and data efficient learning, long-range extrapolation, and state of the art predictive performance. The proposed model also presents an approach to spectral regularization, as the L\'evy process introduces a sparsity-inducing prior over mixture components, allowing automatic selection over model order and pruning of extraneous components. We exploit the algebraic structure of the proposed process for $\mathcal{O}(n)$ training and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ predictions. We perform extrapolations having reasonable uncertainty estimates on several benchmarks, show that the proposed model can recover flexible ground truth covariances and that it is robust to errors in initialization.",2018-02-02T01:40:46Z,2018-02-02T01:40:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00530v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00530v1,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG"
On the asymptotic of exit problems for controlled Markov diffusion   processes with random jumps and vanishing diffusion terms,Getachew K. Befekadu,"In this paper, we study the asymptotic of exit problem for controlled Markov diffusion processes with random jumps and vanishing diffusion terms, where the random jumps are introduced in order to modify the evolution of the controlled diffusions by switching from one mode of dynamics to another. That is, depending on the state-position and state-transition information, the dynamics of the controlled diffusions randomly switches between the different drift and diffusion terms. Here, we specifically investigate the asymptotic exit problem concerning such controlled Markov diffusion processes in two steps: (i) First, for each controlled diffusion model, we look for an admissible Markov control process that minimizes the principal eigenvalue for the corresponding infinitesimal generator with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions -- where such an admissible control process also forces the controlled diffusion process to remain in a given bounded open domain for a longer duration. (ii) Then, using large deviations theory, we determine the exit place and the type of distribution at the exit time for the controlled Markov diffusion processes coupled with random jumps and vanishing diffusion terms. Moreover, the asymptotic results at the exit time also allow us to determine the limiting behavior of the Dirichlet problem for the corresponding system of elliptic partial differential equations containing a small vanishing parameter.",2018-02-06T20:25:46Z,2018-02-06T20:25:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02196v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02196v1,"math.DS, math.PR, 58J65, 35B20, 47D07, 49J20, 60F10, 60J75"
Fundamentals of spreading processes in single and multilayer complex   networks,"Guilherme Ferraz de Arruda, Francisco A.

These processes mainly include the propagation of diseases, rumors and information on top of a given population. In the last two decades, with the advent of modern network science, we have witnessed significant advances in this field of research. Here we review the main theoretical and numerical methods developed for the study of spreading processes on complex networked systems. Specifically, we formally define epidemic processes on single and multilayer networks and discuss in detail the main methods used to perform numerical simulations. Throughout the review, we classify spreading processes (disease and rumor models) into two classes according to the nature of time: (i) continuous-time and (ii) cellular automata approach, where the second one can be further divided into synchronous and asynchronous updating schemes.

The dispersion time of random walks on finite graphs,"Nicolas Rivera, Alexandre Stauffer, Thomas Sauerwald, John Sylvester","We study two random processes on an $n$-vertex graph inspired by the internal diffusion limited aggregation (IDLA) model. In both processes $n$ particles start from an arbitrary but fixed origin. Each particle performs a simple random walk until first encountering an unoccupied vertex, and at which point the vertex becomes occupied and the random walk terminates. In one of the processes, called \textit{Sequential-IDLA}, only one particle moves until settling and only then does the next particle start whereas in the second process, called \textit{Parallel-IDLA}, all unsettled particles move simultaneously. Our main goal is to analyze the so-called dispersion time of these processes, which is the maximum number of steps performed by any of the $n$ particles.   In order to compare the two processes, we develop a coupling which shows the dispersion time of the Parallel-IDLA stochastically dominates that of the Sequential-IDLA; however, the total number of steps performed by all particles has the same distribution in both processes. This coupling also gives us that dispersion time of Parallel-IDLA is bounded in expectation by dispersion time of the Sequential-IDLA up to a multiplicative $\log n$ factor. Moreover, we derive asymptotic upper and lower bound on the dispersion time for several graph classes, such as cliques, cycles, binary trees, $d$-dimensional grids, hypercubes and expanders. Most of our bounds are tight up to a multiplicative constant.",2018-08-28T11:03:24Z,2019-11-26T15:29:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09219v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09219v2,"cs.DM, math.CO, math.PR"
An infinite-dimensional helix invariant under spherical projections,Zakhar Kabluchko,"We classify all subsets $S$ of the projective Hilbert space with the following property: for every point $\pm s_0\in S$, the spherical projection of $S\backslash\{\pm s_0\}$ to the hyperplane orthogonal to $\pm s_0$ is isometric to $S\backslash\{\pm s_0\}$. In probabilistic terms, this means that we characterize all zero-mean Gaussian processes $Z=(Z(t))_{t\in T}$ with the property that for every $s_0\in T$ the conditional distribution of $(Z(t))_{t\in T}$ given that $Z(s_0)=0$ coincides with the distribution of $(\varphi(t; s_0) Z(t))_{t\in T}$ for some function $\varphi(t;s_0)$. A basic example of such process is the stationary zero-mean Gaussian process $(X(t))_{t\in\mathbb R}$ with covariance function $\mathbb E [X(s) X(t)] = 1/\cosh (t-s)$. We show that, in general, the process $Z$ can be decomposed into a union of mutually independent processes of two types: (i) processes of the form $(a(t) X(\psi(t)))_{t\in T}$, with $a: T\to \mathbb R$, $\psi(t): T\to \mathbb R$, and (ii) certain exceptional Gaussian processes defined on four-point index sets.

A convergent discretisation method for transition path theory for   diffusion processes,"Nada Cvetkoviƒá, Tim Conrad, Han Cheng Lie","Transition path theory (TPT) for diffusion processes is a framework for analysing the transitions of multiscale ergodic diffusion processes between disjoint metastable subsets of state space. Most methods for applying TPT involve the construction of a Markov state model on a discretisation of state space that approximates the underlying diffusion process. However, the assumption of Markovianity is difficult to verify in practice, and there are to date no known error bounds or convergence results for these methods. We propose a Monte Carlo method for approximating the forward committor, probability current, and streamlines from TPT for diffusion processes. Our method uses only sample trajectory data and partitions of state space based on Voronoi tessellations. It does not require the construction of a Markovian approximating process. We rigorously prove error bounds for the approximate TPT objects and use these bounds to show convergence to their exact counterparts in the limit of arbitrarily fine discretisation. We illustrate some features of our method by application to a process that solves the Smoluchowski equation on a triple-well potential.",2019-07-12T15:34:06Z,2020-04-02T11:32:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05799v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05799v3,"math.NA, cs.NA, 65C05 (Primary) 37M10, 62M20, 65N22, 65L70 (Secondary)"
Robust inference of memory structure for efficient quantum modelling of   stochastic processes,"Matthew Ho, Mile Gu, Thomas J. Elliott","A growing body of work has established the modelling of stochastic processes as a promising area of application for quantum techologies; it has been shown that quantum models are able to replicate the future statistics of a stochastic process whilst retaining less information about the past than any classical model must -- even for a purely classical process. Such memory-efficient models open a potential future route to study complex systems in greater detail than ever before, and suggest profound consequences for our notions of structure in their dynamics. Yet, to date methods for constructing these quantum models are based on having a prior knowledge of the optimal classical model. Here, we introduce a protocol for blind inference of the memory structure of quantum models -- tailored to take advantage of quantum features -- direct from time-series data, in the process highlighting the robustness of their structure to noise. This in turn provides a way to construct memory-efficient quantum models of stochastic processes whilst circumventing certain drawbacks that manifest solely as a result of classical information processing in classical inference protocols.",2019-11-07T06:08:37Z,2020-02-20T14:42:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02767v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02767v2,"quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.IT, math.IT"
Transport Gaussian Processes for Regression,Gonzalo Rios,"Gaussian process (GP) priors are non-parametric generative models with appealing modelling properties for Bayesian inference: they can model non-linear relationships through noisy observations, have closed-form expressions for training and inference, and are governed by interpretable hyperparameters. However, GP models rely on Gaussianity, an assumption that does not hold in several real-world scenarios, e.g., when observations are bounded or have extreme-value dependencies, a natural phenomenon in physics, finance and social sciences. Although beyond-Gaussian stochastic processes have caught the attention of the GP community, a principled definition and rigorous treatment is still lacking. In this regard, we propose a methodology to construct stochastic processes, which include GPs, warped GPs, Student-t processes and several others under a single unified approach. We also provide formulas and algorithms for training and inference of the proposed models in the regression problem. Our approach is inspired by layers-based models, where each proposed layer changes a specific property over the generated stochastic process. That, in turn, allows us to push-forward a standard Gaussian white noise prior towards other more expressive stochastic processes, for which marginals and copulas need not be Gaussian, while retaining the appealing properties of GPs.

Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data by Identifying the Annotation   Process,"Naji Shajarisales, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang","In binary classification, Learning from Positive and Unlabeled data (LePU) is semi-supervised learning but with labeled elements from only one class. Most of the research on LePU relies on some form of independence between the selection process of annotated examples and the features of the annotated class, known as the Selected Completely At Random (SCAR) assumption. Yet the annotation process is an important part of the data collection, and in many cases it naturally depends on certain features of the data (e.g., the intensity of an image and the size of the object to be detected in the image). Without any constraints on the model for the annotation process, classification results in the LePU problem will be highly non-unique. So proper, flexible constraints are needed. In this work we incorporate more flexible and realistic models for the annotation process than SCAR, and more importantly, offer a solution for the challenging LePU problem. On the theory side, we establish the identifiability of the properties of the annotation process and the classification function, in light of the considered constraints on the data-generating process. We also propose an inference algorithm to learn the parameters of the model, with successful experimental results on both simulated and real data.

We recover latent components of interest, which have undergone a linear mixing. We study asymptotic properties of a classical unmixing estimator, that is based on simultaneous diagonalization of the covariance matrix and an autocovariance matrix with lag $\tau$. Our main contribution is that our asymptotic results can be applied to a large class of processes. In related literature, the processes are typically assumed to have weak correlations. We extend this class and consider the unmixing estimator under stronger dependency structures. In particular, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the unmixing estimator under both, long- and short-range dependent complex-valued processes. Consequently, our theory covers unmixing estimators that converge slower than the usual $\sqrt{T}$ and unmixing estimators that produce non-Gaussian asymptotic distributions. The presented methodology is a powerful prepossessing tool and highly applicable in several fields of statistics. Complex-valued processes are frequently encountered in, for example, biomedical applications and signal processing.

Privacy-preserving feature selection: A survey and proposing a new set   of protocols,"Javad Rahimipour Anaraki, Saeed Samet","Feature selection is the process of sieving features, in which informative features are separated from the redundant and irrelevant ones. This process plays an important role in machine learning, data mining and bioinformatics. However, traditional feature selection methods are only capable of processing centralized datasets and are not able to satisfy today's distributed data processing needs. These needs require a new category of data processing algorithms called privacy-preserving feature selection, which protects users' data by not revealing any part of the data neither in the intermediate processing nor in the final results. This is vital for the datasets which contain individuals' data, such as medical datasets. Therefore, it is rational to either modify the existing algorithms or propose new ones to not only introduce the capability of being applied to distributed datasets, but also act responsibly in handling users' data by protecting their privacy. In this paper, we will review three privacy-preserving feature selection methods and provide suggestions to improve their performance when any gap is identified.

Delay Characterization of Mobile Edge Computing for 6G Time-Sensitive   Services,"Jianyu Cao, Wei Feng, Ning Ge, Jianhua Lu","Time-sensitive services (TSSs) have been widely envisioned for future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks. Due to its inherent low-latency advantage, mobile edge computing (MEC) will be an indispensable enabler for TSSs. The random characteristics of the delay experienced by users are key metrics reflecting the quality of service (QoS) of TSSs. Most existing studies on MEC have focused on the average delay. Only a few research efforts have been devoted to other random delay characteristics, such as the delay bound violation probability and the probability distribution of the delay, by decoupling the transmission and computation processes of MEC. However, if these two processes could not be decoupled, the coupling will bring new challenges to analyzing the random delay characteristics. In this paper, an MEC system with a limited computation buffer at the edge server is considered. In this system, the transmission process and computation process form a feedback loop and could not be decoupled. We formulate a discrete-time two-stage tandem queueing system. Then, by using the matrix-geometric method, we obtain the estimation methods for the random delay characteristics, including the probability distribution of the delay, the delay bound violation probability, the average delay and the delay standard deviation. The estimation methods are verified by simulations. The random delay characteristics are analyzed by numerical experiments, which unveil the coupling relationship between the transmission process and computation process for MEC. These results will largely facilitate elaborate allocation of communication and computation resources to improve the QoS of TSSs.",2020-09-17T03:25:02Z,2020-09-17T03:25:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12170v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12170v1,"eess.SP, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Large deviations for Markov processes with stochastic resetting :   analysis via the empirical density and flows or via excursions between resets,Cecile Monthus,"Markov processes with stochastic resetting towards the origin generically converge towards non-equilibrium steady-states. Long dynamical trajectories can be thus analyzed via the large deviations at Level 2.5 for the joint probability of the empirical density and the empirical flows, or via the large deviations of semi-Markov processes for the empirical density of excursions between consecutive resets. The large deviations properties of general time-additive observables involving the position and the increments of the dynamical trajectory are then analyzed in terms of the appropriate Markov tilted processes and of the corresponding conditioned processes obtained via the generalization of Doob's h-transform. This general formalism is described in detail for the three possible frameworks, namely discrete-time/discrete-space Markov chains, continuous-time/discrete-space Markov jump processes and continuous-time/continuous-space diffusion processes, and is illustrated with explicit results for the Sisyphus Random Walk and its variants, when the reset probabilities or reset rates are space-dependent.",2020-09-25T15:18:59Z,2021-02-03T15:05:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12287v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12287v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.dis-nn, math-ph, math.MP"
Time Matters: Time-Aware LSTMs for Predictive Business Process   Monitoring,"An Nguyen, Srijeet Chatterjee, Sven Weinzierl, Leo Schwinn, Martin Matzner, Bjoern Eskofier","Predictive business process monitoring (PBPM) aims to predict future process behavior during ongoing process executions based on event log data. Especially, techniques for the next activity and timestamp prediction can help to improve the performance of operational business processes. Recently, many PBPM solutions based on deep learning were proposed by researchers. Due to the sequential nature of event log data, a common choice is to apply recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. We argue, that the elapsed time between events is informative. However, current PBPM techniques mainly use 'vanilla' LSTM cells and hand-crafted time-related control flow features. To better model the time dependencies between events, we propose a new PBPM technique based on time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) cells.

Also, herewe research the main goals of procurement information system which must be achieved in every organization because procurement process takes place in every public organization. Based on the model of the business technology matrix their processes can be executed by other companies engaged in similar activities. This research paper describes the timing of the sub processes, also. The timing of sub processes needs to be reduced as much as possible to achieve the planned results at the exit of the sub processes so that the costs of running sub-processes are equal to or lower than they had been so far, but with a higher quality output. We discuss possible threats to the information systems organization, and how to protect electronic information in the process of restoration of electronic data base for the financial information system.

Trade-offs in Decentralized Multi-Antenna Architectures: The WAX   Decomposition,"Juan Vidal Alegr√≠a, Fredrik Rusek, Ove Edfors","Current research on multi-antenna architectures is trending towards increasing the amount of antennas in the base stations (BSs) so as to increase the spectral efficiency. As a result, the interconnection bandwidth and computational complexity required to process the data using centralized architectures is becoming prohibitively high. Decentralized architectures can reduce these requirements by pre-processing the data before it arrives at a central processing unit (CPU). However, performing decentralized processing introduces also cost in complexity/interconnection bandwidth at the antenna end which is in general being ignored. This paper aims at studying the interplay between level of decentralization and the associated complexity/interconnection bandwidth requirement at the antenna end. To do so, we propose a general framework for centralized/decentralized architectures that can explore said interplay by adjusting some system parameters, namely the number of connections to the CPU (level of decentralization), and the number of multiplications/outputs per antenna (complexity/interconnection bandwidth). We define a novel matrix decomposition, the WAX decomposition, that allows information-lossless processing within our proposed framework, and we use it to obtain the operational limits of the interplay under study. We also look into some of the limitations of the WAX decomposition.",2020-12-01T15:27:13Z,2021-05-29T17:44:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00572v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00572v3,"eess.SP, cs.IT, math.IT"
Towards Radio Designs with Non-Linear Processing for Next Generation   Mobile Systems,"Konstantinos Nikitopoulos, Marcin Filo, Chathura Jayawardena, Rahim Tafazolli","MIMO mobile systems, with a large number of antennas at the base-station side, enable the concurrent transmission of multiple, spatially separated information streams and, therefore, enable improved network throughput and connectivity both in uplink and downlink transmissions. Traditionally, to efficiently facilitate such MIMO transmissions, linear base-station processing is adopted, that translates the MIMO channel into several single-antenna channels. Still, while such approaches are relatively easy to implement, they can leave on the table a significant amount of unexploited MIMO capacity. Recently proposed non-linear base-station processing methods claim this unexplored capacity and promise a substantially increased network throughput. Still, to the best of the authors' knowledge, non-linear base-station processing methods not only have not yet been adopted by actual systems, but have not even been evaluated in a standard-compliant framework, involving of all the necessary algorithmic modules required by a practical system. This work, outlines our experience by trying to incorporate and evaluate the gains of non-linear base-station processing in a 3GPP standard environment. We discuss the several corresponding challenges and our adopted solutions, together with their corresponding limitations.

Deep Cellular Recurrent Network for Efficient Analysis of Time-Series   Data with Spatial Information,"Lasitha Vidyaratne, Mahbubul Alam, Alexander Glandon, Anna Shabalina, Christopher Tennant, Khan Iftekharuddin","Efficient processing of large-scale time series data is an intricate problem in machine learning. Conventional sensor signal processing pipelines with hand engineered feature extraction often involve huge computational cost with high dimensional data. Deep recurrent neural networks have shown promise in automated feature learning for improved time-series processing. However, generic deep recurrent models grow in scale and depth with increased complexity of the data. This is particularly challenging in presence of high dimensional data with temporal and spatial characteristics. Consequently, this work proposes a novel deep cellular recurrent neural network (DCRNN) architecture to efficiently process complex multi-dimensional time series data with spatial information. The cellular recurrent architecture in the proposed model allows for location-aware synchronous processing of time series data from spatially distributed sensor signal sources. Extensive trainable parameter sharing due to cellularity in the proposed architecture ensures efficiency in the use of recurrent processing units with high-dimensional inputs. This study also investigates the versatility of the proposed DCRNN model for classification of multi-class time series data from different application domains. Consequently, the proposed DCRNN architecture is evaluated using two time-series datasets: a multichannel scalp EEG dataset for seizure detection, and a machine fault detection dataset obtained in-house. The results suggest that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while utilizing substantially less trainable parameters when compared to comparable methods in the literature.",2021-01-12T20:08:18Z,2021-01-12T20:08:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05608v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05608v1,"cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.SP"

To the best of our knowledge, this is a new mathematical result. We state this result as Proposition 1. We state as Corollary 1 that the negative binomial distribution of the time-homogeneous BDI process discussed in Part I extends to the general time-nonhomogeneous case, provided that the ratio of the immigration rate to the birth rate is a constant. In section 1.2, we take up the heuristic approach discussed by Bartlett and Bailey (1964), and carry it out to completion by arriving at the solution obtained above,.   In Section 2, we present the results of our extensive simulation experiments of the time-nonhomogeneous BD process that was analyzed in Part III-A and confirm our analytic results. In Section 3, we undertake similar simulation experiments for the BDI process that is analyzed in Section 1.

A branching process with deletions and mergers that matches the   threshold for hypercube percolation,"Laura Eslava, Sarah Penington, Fiona Skerman","We define a graph process $\mathcal{G}(p,q)$ based on a discrete branching process with deletions and mergers, which is inspired by the 4-cycle structure of both the hypercube $Q_d$ and the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for large $d$. Individuals have Poisson offspring distribution with mean $1+p$ and certain deletions and mergers occur with probability $q$; these parameters correspond to the mean number of edges discovered from a given vertex in an exploration of a percolation cluster and to the probability that a non-backtracking path of length four closes a cycle, respectively.   We prove survival and extinction under certain conditions on $p$ and $q$ that heuristically match the known expansions of the critical probabilities for bond percolation on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and the hypercube $Q_d$. These expansions have been rigorously established by Hara and Slade in 1995, and van der Hofstad and Slade in 2006, respectively. We stress that our method does not constitute a branching process proof for the percolation threshold.   The analysis of the graph process survival is considerably more challenging than for branching processes in discrete time, due to the interdependence between the descendants of different individuals in the same generation. In fact, it is left open whether the survival probability of $\mathcal{G}(p,q)$ is monotone in $p$ or $q$; we discuss this and some other open problems regarding the new graph process.",2021-04-09T14:57:20Z,2021-04-09T14:57:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04407v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04407v1,"math.PR, math.CO, 60J85 (primary), 60C05, 60K35, 05C80 (secondary)"
Improvement of Noise-Robust Single-Channel Voice Activity Detection with   Spatial Pre-processing,"Max V√¶hrens, Andreas Jonas Fuglsig, Anders Post Jacobsen, Nicolai Almskou Rasmussen, Victor M√∏lbach Nissen, Joachim Roland Hejslet, Zheng-Hua Tan","Voice activity detection (VAD) remains a challenge in noisy environments. With access to multiple microphones, prior studies have attempted to improve the noise robustness of VAD by creating multi-channel VAD (MVAD) methods. However, MVAD is relatively new compared to single-channel VAD (SVAD), which has been thoroughly developed in the past. It might therefore be advantageous to improve SVAD methods with pre-processing to obtain superior VAD, which is under-explored. This paper improves SVAD through two pre-processing methods, a beamformer and a spatial target speaker detector. The spatial detector sets signal frames to zero when no potential speaker is present within a target direction. The detector may be implemented as a filter, meaning the input signal for the SVAD is filtered according to the detector's output; or it may be implemented as a spatial VAD to be combined with the SVAD output. The evaluation is made on a noisy reverberant speech database, with clean speech from the Aurora 2 database and with white and babble noise. The results show that SVAD algorithms are significantly improved by the presented pre-processing methods, especially the spatial detector, across all signal-to-noise ratios.

Adapting CRISP-DM for Idea Mining: A Data Mining Process for Generating   Ideas Using a Textual Dataset,W. Y. Ayele,"Data mining project managers can benefit from using standard data mining process models. The benefits of using standard process models for data mining, such as the de facto and the most popular, Cross-Industry-Standard-Process model for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) are reduced cost and time. Also, standard models facilitate knowledge transfer, reuse of best practices, and minimize knowledge requirements. On the other hand, to unlock the potential of ever-growing textual data such as publications, patents, social media data, and documents of various forms, digital innovation is increasingly needed. Furthermore, the introduction of cutting-edge machine learning tools and techniques enable the elicitation of ideas. The processing of unstructured textual data to generate new and useful ideas is referred to as idea mining. Existing literature about idea mining merely overlooks the utilization of standard data mining process models. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a reusable model to generate ideas, CRISP-DM, for Idea Mining (CRISP-IM). The design and development of the CRISP-IM are done following the design science approach. The CRISP-IM facilitates idea generation, through the use of Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM), unsupervised machine learning, and subsequent statistical analysis on a dataset of scholarly articles. The adapted CRISP-IM can be used to guide the process of identifying trends using scholarly literature datasets or temporally organized patent or any other textual dataset of any domain to elicit ideas.

Simulating the DFT Algorithm for Audio Processing,"Omkar Deshpande, Kharanshu Solanki, Sree Pujitha Suribhatla, Sanya Zaveri, Luv Ghodasara","Since the evolution of digital computers, the storage of data has always been in terms of discrete bits that can store values of either 1 or 0. Hence, all computer programs (such as MATLAB), convert any input continuous signal into a discrete dataset. Applying this to oscillating signals, such as audio, opens a domain for processing as well as editing. The Fourier transform, which is an integral over infinite limits, for the use of signal processing is discrete. The essential feature of the Fourier transform is to decompose any signal into a combination of multiple sinusoidal waves that are easy to deal with. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be represented as a matrix, with each data point acting as an orthogonal point, allowing one to perform complicated transformations on individual frequencies. Due to this formulation, all the concepts of linear algebra and linear transforms prove to be extremely useful here. In this paper, we first explain the theoretical basis of audio processing using linear algebra, and then focus on a simulation coded in MATLAB, to process and edit various audio samples. The code is open ended and easily expandable by just defining newer matrices which can transform over the original audio signal. Finally, this paper attempts to highlight and briefly explain the results that emerge from the simulation",2021-04-29T11:57:44Z,2021-04-29T11:57:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02820v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02820v1,"eess.SP, cs.SD, eess.AS"
Discrete-time Contraction-based Control of Nonlinear Systems with   Parametric Uncertainties using Neural Networks,"Lai Wei, Ryan McCloy, Jie Bao","In response to the continuously changing feedstock supply and market demand for products with different specifications, the processes need to be operated at time-varying operating conditions and targets (e.g., setpoints) to improve the process economy, in contrast to traditional process operations around predetermined equilibriums. In this paper, a contraction theory-based control approach using neural networks is developed for nonlinear chemical processes to achieve time-varying reference tracking. This approach leverages the universal approximation characteristics of neural networks with discrete-time contraction analysis and control. It involves training a neural network to learn a contraction metric and differential feedback gain, that is embedded in a contraction-based controller. A second, separate neural network is also incorporated into the control-loop to perform online learning of uncertain system model parameters. The resulting control scheme is capable of achieving efficient offset-free tracking of time-varying references, with a full range of model uncertainty, without the need for controller structure redesign as the reference changes. This is a robust approach that can deal with bounded parametric uncertainties in the process model, which are commonly encountered in industrial (chemical) processes. This approach also ensures the process stability during online simultaneous learning and control. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the above approach.",2021-05-12T05:07:34Z,2022-06-20T12:35:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05432v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05432v3,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY, math.OC"
Control Architecture of the Double-Cross-Correlation Processor for   Sampling-Rate-Offset Estimation in Acoustic Sensor Networks,"Aleksej Chinaev, Sven Wienand, Gerald Enzner","Distributed hardware of acoustic sensor networks bears inconsistency of local sampling frequencies, which is detrimental to signal processing. Fundamentally, sampling rate offset (SRO) nonlinearly relates the discrete-time signals acquired by different sensor nodes. As such, retrieval of SRO from the available signals requires nonlinear estimation, like double-cross-correlation processing (DXCP), and frequently results in biased estimation. SRO compensation by asynchronous sampling rate conversion (ASRC) on the signals then leaves an unacceptable residual. As a remedy to this problem, multi-stage procedures have been devised to diminish the SRO residual with multiple iterations of SRO estimation and ASRC over the entire signal. This paper converts the mechanism of offline multi-stage processing into a continuous feedback-control loop comprising a controlled ASRC unit followed by an online implementation of DXCP-based SRO estimation. To support the design of an optimum internal model control unit for this closed-loop system, the paper deploys an analytical dynamical model of the proposed online DXCP. The resulting control architecture then merely applies a single treatment of each signal frame, while efficiently diminishing SRO bias with time. Evaluations with both speech and Gaussian input demonstrate that the high accuracy of multi-stage processing is maintained at the low complexity of single-stage (open-loop) processing.",2021-05-28T11:13:35Z,2021-05-28T11:13:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13743v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13743v1,"eess.AS, cs.SY, eess.SP, eess.SY"
Large Deviation Asymptotics and Bayesian Posterior Consistency on   Stochastic Processes and Dynamical Systems,"Langxuan Su, Sayan Mukherjee","We consider generalized Bayesian inference on stochastic processes and dynamical systems with potentially long-range dependency. Given a sequence of observations, a class of parametrized model processes with a prior distribution, and a loss function, we specify the generalized posterior distribution. The problem of frequentist posterior consistency is concerned with whether as more and more samples are observed, the posterior distribution on parameters will asymptotically concentrate on the ""right"" parameters. We show that posterior consistency can be derived using a combination of classical large deviation techniques, such as Varadhan's lemma, conditional/quenched large deviations, annealed large deviations, and exponential approximations. We show that the posterior distribution will asymptotically concentrate on parameters that minimize the expected loss and a divergence term, and we identify the divergence term as the Donsker-Varadhan relative entropy rate from process-level large deviations. As an application, we prove new quenched and annealed large deviation asymptotics and new Bayesian posterior consistency results for a class of mixing stochastic processes. In the case of Markov processes, one can obtain explicit conditions for posterior consistency, whenever estimates for log-Sobolev constants are available, which makes our framework essentially a black box. We also recover state-of-the-art posterior consistency on classical dynamical systems with a simple proof. Our approach has the potential of proving posterior consistency for a wide range of Bayesian procedures in a unified way.",2021-06-13T01:47:22Z,2023-04-24T22:15:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06894v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06894v2,"math.ST, math.DS, math.PR, stat.TH, 60F10, 62G20"

Speeding Up Speech Synthesis In Diffusion Models By Reducing Data   Distribution Recovery Steps Via Content Transfer,Peter Ochieng,"Diffusion based vocoders have been criticised for being slow due to the many steps required during sampling. Moreover, the model's loss function that is popularly implemented is designed such that the target is the original input $x_0$ or error $\epsilon_0$. For early time steps of the reverse process, this results in large prediction errors, which can lead to speech distortions and increase the learning time. We propose a setup where the targets are the different outputs of forward process time steps with a goal to reduce the magnitude of prediction errors and reduce the training time. We use the different layers of a neural network (NN) to perform denoising by training them to learn to generate representations similar to the noised outputs in the forward process of the diffusion. The NN layers learn to progressively denoise the input in the reverse process until finally the final layer estimates the clean speech. To avoid 1:1 mapping between layers of the neural network and the forward process steps, we define a skip parameter $\tau>1$ such that an NN layer is trained to cumulatively remove the noise injected in the $\tau$ steps in the forward process. This significantly reduces the number of data distribution recovery steps and, consequently, the time to generate speech. We show through extensive evaluation that the proposed technique generates high-fidelity speech in competitive time that outperforms current state-of-the-art tools. The proposed technique is also able to generalize well to unseen speech.",2023-09-18T10:35:27Z,2024-11-23T02:05:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09652v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09652v3,"cs.SD, cs.CL, eess.AS"

Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Random Subspace and Subsampling   Ensembles of Dirichlet Process Mixtures,"Dongwook Kim, Juyeon Park, Hee Cheol Chung, Seonghyun Jeong","Probabilistic mixture models are recognized as effective tools for unsupervised outlier detection owing to their interpretability and global characteristics. Among these, Dirichlet process mixture models stand out as a strong alternative to conventional finite mixture models for both clustering and outlier detection tasks. Unlike finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixtures are infinite mixture models that automatically determine the number of mixture components based on the data. Despite their advantages, the adoption of Dirichlet process mixture models for unsupervised outlier detection has been limited by challenges related to computational inefficiency and sensitivity to outliers in the construction of outlier detectors. Additionally, Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures struggle to effectively model non-Gaussian data with discrete or binary features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel outlier detection method that utilizes ensembles of Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures. This unsupervised algorithm employs random subspace and subsampling ensembles to ensure efficient computation and improve the robustness of the outlier detector. The ensemble approach further improves the suitability of the proposed method for detecting outliers in non-Gaussian data.

Analysis of a detailed multi-stage model of stochastic gene expression   using queueing theory and model reduction,"Muhan Ma, Juraj Szavits-Nossan, Abhyudai Singh, Ramon Grima","We introduce a biologically detailed, stochastic model of gene expression describing the multiple rate-limiting steps of transcription, nuclear pre-mRNA processing, nuclear mRNA export, cytoplasmic mRNA degradation and translation of mRNA into protein. The processes in sub-cellular compartments are described by an arbitrary number of processing stages, thus accounting for a significantly finer molecular description of gene expression than conventional models such as the telegraph, two-stage and three-stage models of gene expression. We use two distinct tools, queueing theory and model reduction using the slow-scale linear-noise approximation, to derive exact or approximate analytic expressions for the moments or distributions of nuclear mRNA, cytoplasmic mRNA and protein fluctuations, as well as lower bounds for their Fano factors in steady-state conditions. We use these to study the phase diagram of the stochastic model; in particular we derive parametric conditions determining three types of transitions in the properties of mRNA fluctuations: from sub-Poissonian to super-Poissonian noise, from high noise in the nucleus to high noise in the cytoplasm, and from a monotonic increase to a monotonic decrease of the Fano factor with the number of processing stages. In contrast, protein fluctuations are always super-Poissonian and show weak dependence on the number of mRNA processing stages. Our results delineate the region of parameter space where conventional models give qualitatively incorrect results and provide insight into how the number of processing stages, e.g. the number of rate-limiting steps in initiation, splicing and mRNA degradation, shape stochastic gene expression by modulation of molecular memory.",2024-01-23T11:14:00Z,2024-01-23T11:14:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12661v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12661v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM, q-bio.SC"
CaRiNG: Learning Temporal Causal Representation under Non-Invertible   Generation Process,"Guangyi Chen, Yifan Shen, Zhenhao Chen, Xiangchen Song, Yuewen Sun, Weiran Yao, Xiao Liu, Kun Zhang","Identifying the underlying time-delayed latent causal processes in sequential data is vital for grasping temporal dynamics and making downstream reasoning. While some recent methods can robustly identify these latent causal variables, they rely on strict assumptions about the invertible generation process from latent variables to observed data. However, these assumptions are often hard to satisfy in real-world applications containing information loss. For instance, the visual perception process translates a 3D space into 2D images, or the phenomenon of persistence of vision incorporates historical data into current perceptions. To address this challenge, we establish an identifiability theory that allows for the recovery of independent latent components even when they come from a nonlinear and non-invertible mix. Using this theory as a foundation, we propose a principled approach, CaRiNG, to learn the CAusal RepresentatIon of Non-invertible Generative temporal data with identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we utilize temporal context to recover lost latent information and apply the conditions in our theory to guide the training process. Through experiments conducted on synthetic datasets, we validate that our CaRiNG method reliably identifies the causal process, even when the generation process is non-invertible. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach considerably improves temporal understanding and reasoning in practical applications.",2024-01-25T22:01:07Z,2024-05-30T13:09:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14535v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14535v2,"cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ME"
Tensor-based process control and monitoring for semiconductor   manufacturing with unstable disturbances,"Yanrong Li, Juan Du, Fugee Tsung, Wei Jiang","With the development and popularity of sensors installed in manufacturing systems, complex data are collected during manufacturing processes, which brings challenges for traditional process control methods. This paper proposes a novel process control and monitoring method for the complex structure of high-dimensional image-based overlay errors (modeled in tensor form), which are collected in semiconductor manufacturing processes. The proposed method aims to reduce overlay errors using limited control recipes. We first build a high-dimensional process model and propose different tensor-on-vector regression algorithms to estimate parameters in the model to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. Then, based on the estimate of tensor parameters, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) controller for tensor data is designed whose stability is theoretically guaranteed. Considering the fact that low-dimensional control recipes cannot compensate for all high-dimensional disturbances on the image, control residuals are monitored to prevent significant drifts of uncontrollable high-dimensional disturbances. Through extensive simulations and real case studies, the performances of parameter estimation algorithms and the EWMA controller in tensor space are evaluated. Compared with existing image-based feedback controllers, the superiority of our method is verified especially when disturbances are not stable.",2024-01-31T03:35:08Z,2024-01-31T03:35:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17573v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17573v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.IV, eess.SY"
Interactive and Intelligent Root Cause Analysis in Manufacturing with   Causal Bayesian Networks and Knowledge Graphs,"Christoph Wehner, Maximilian Kertel, Judith Wewerka","Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in the manufacturing of electric vehicles is the process of identifying fault causes. Traditionally, the RCA is conducted manually, relying on process expert knowledge. Meanwhile, sensor networks collect significant amounts of data in the manufacturing process. Using this data for RCA makes it more efficient. However, purely data-driven methods like Causal Bayesian Networks have problems scaling to large-scale, real-world manufacturing processes due to the vast amount of potential cause-effect relationships (CERs). Furthermore, purely data-driven methods have the potential to leave out already known CERs or to learn spurious CERs. The paper contributes by proposing an interactive and intelligent RCA tool that combines expert knowledge of an electric vehicle manufacturing process and a data-driven machine learning method. It uses reasoning over a large-scale Knowledge Graph of the manufacturing process while learning a Causal Bayesian Network. In addition, an Interactive User Interface enables a process expert to give feedback to the root cause graph by adding and removing information to the Knowledge Graph. The interactive and intelligent RCA tool reduces the learning time of the Causal Bayesian Network while decreasing the number of spurious CERs. Thus, the interactive and intelligent RCA tool closes the feedback loop between expert and machine learning method.",2024-01-20T21:25:57Z,2024-01-20T21:25:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00043v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00043v1,"cs.AI, cs.CE, cs.LG"
Explaining generative diffusion models via visual analysis for   interpretable decision-making process,"Ji-Hoon Park, Yeong-Joon Ju, Seong-Whan Lee","Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generation tasks. Nevertheless, explaining the diffusion process remains challenging due to it being a sequence of denoising noisy images that are difficult for experts to interpret. To address this issue, we propose the three research questions to interpret the diffusion process from the perspective of the visual concepts generated by the model and the region where the model attends in each time step. We devise tools for visualizing the diffusion process and answering the aforementioned research questions to render the diffusion process human-understandable. We show how the output is progressively generated in the diffusion process by explaining the level of denoising and highlighting relationships to foundational visual concepts at each time step through the results of experiments with various visual analyses using the tools. Throughout the training of the diffusion model, the model learns diverse visual concepts corresponding to each time-step, enabling the model to predict varying levels of visual concepts at different stages. We substantiate our tools using Area Under Cover (AUC) score, correlation quantification, and cross-attention mapping. Our findings provide insights into the diffusion process and pave the way for further research into explainable diffusion mechanisms.",2024-02-16T02:12:20Z,2024-02-16T02:12:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10404v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10404v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, 68T01"
Accelerating local laplacian filters on FPGAs,"Shashwat Khandelwal, Ziaul Choudhury, Shashwat Shrivastava, Suresh Purini","Images when processed using various enhancement techniques often lead to edge degradation and other unwanted artifacts such as halos. These artifacts pose a major problem for photographic applications where they can denude the quality of an image. There is a plethora of edge-aware techniques proposed in the field of image processing. However, these require the application of complex optimization or post-processing methods. Local Laplacian Filtering is an edge-aware image processing technique that involves the construction of simple Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids. This technique can be successfully applied for detail smoothing, detail enhancement, tone mapping and inverse tone mapping of an image while keeping it artifact-free. The problem though with this approach is that it is computationally expensive. Hence, parallelization schemes using multi-core CPUs and GPUs have been proposed. As is well known, they are not power-efficient, and a well-designed hardware architecture on an FPGA can do better on the performance per watt metric. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator, which exploits fully the available parallelism in the Local Laplacian Filtering algorithm, while minimizing the utilization of on-chip FPGA resources. On Virtex-7 FPGA, we obtain a 7.5x speed-up to process a 1 MB image when compared to an optimized baseline CPU implementation.

GLA-Grad: A Griffin-Lim Extended Waveform Generation Diffusion Model,"Haocheng Liu, Teysir Baoueb, Mathieu Fontaine, Jonathan Le Roux, Gael Richard","Diffusion models are receiving a growing interest for a variety of signal generation tasks such as speech or music synthesis. WaveGrad, for example, is a successful diffusion model that conditionally uses the mel spectrogram to guide a diffusion process for the generation of high-fidelity audio. However, such models face important challenges concerning the noise diffusion process for training and inference, and they have difficulty generating high-quality speech for speakers that were not seen during training. With the aim of minimizing the conditioning error and increasing the efficiency of the noise diffusion process, we propose in this paper a new scheme called GLA-Grad, which consists in introducing a phase recovery algorithm such as the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GLA) at each step of the regular diffusion process. Furthermore, it can be directly applied to an already-trained waveform generation model, without additional training or fine-tuning.

Mixing Times for the Facilitated Exclusion Process,"James Ayre, Paul Chleboun","The facilitated simple exclusion process (FEP) is a one-dimensional exclusion process with a dynamical constraint. We establish bounds on the mixing time of the FEP on the segment, with closed boundaries, and the circle. The FEP on these spaces exhibits transient states that, if the macroscopic density of particles is at least $1/2$, the process will eventually exit to reach an ergodic component. If the macroscopic density is less than $1/2$ the process will hit an absorbing state. We show that the symmetric FEP (SFEP) on the segment $\{1,\ldots,N\}$, with $k>N/2$ particles, has mixing time of order $N^{2}\log(N-k)$ and exhibits the pre-cutoff phenomenon. For the asymmetric FEP (AFEP) on the segment, we show that there exists initial conditions for which the hitting time of the ergodic component is exponentially slow in the number of holes $N-k$. In particular, when $N-k$ is large enough, the hitting time of the ergodic component determines the mixing time. For the SFEP on the circle of size $N$, and macroscopic particle density $\rho \in(1/2,1)$, we establish bounds on the mixing time of order $N^{2}\log N$ for the process restricted to its ergodic component. We also give an upper bound on the hitting time of the ergodic component of order $N^{2}\log N$ for a large class of initial conditions. The proofs rely on couplings with exclusion processes (both open and closed boundaries) via a novel lattice path (height function) construction of the FEP.",2024-02-29T09:49:13Z,2024-02-29T09:49:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18999v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18999v1,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, 60K35, 60J27, 82C22"
A complete logic for causal consistency,"Will Simmons, Aleks Kissinger","The $\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ construction takes a base category of ``raw materials'' and builds a category of higher order causal processes, that is a category whose types encode causal (a.k.a. signalling) constraints between collections of systems. Notable examples are categories of higher-order stochastic maps and higher-order quantum channels. Well-typedness in $\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ corresponds to a composition of processes being causally consistent, in the sense that any choice of local processes of the prescribed types yields an overall process respecting causality constraints. It follows that closed processes always occur with probability 1, ruling out e.g. causal paradoxes arising from time loops. It has previously been shown that $\mathrm{Caus}[\mathcal{C}]$ gives a model of MLL+MIX and BV logic, hence these logics give sufficient conditions for causal consistency, but they fail to provide a complete characterisation. In this follow-on work, we introduce graph types as a tool to examine causal structures over graphs in this model. We explore their properties, standard forms, and equivalent definitions; in particular, a process obeys all signalling constraints of the graph iff it is expressible as an affine combination of factorisations into local causal processes connected according to the edges of the graph. The properties of graph types are then used to prove completeness for causal consistency of a new causal logic that conservatively extends pomset logic. The crucial extra ingredient is a notion of distinguished atoms that correspond to first-order states, which only admit a flow of information in one direction. Using the fact that causal logic conservatively extends pomset logic, we finish by giving a physically-meaningful interpretation to a separating statement between pomset and BV.",2024-03-14T11:36:53Z,2024-03-14T11:36:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09297v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09297v1,"cs.LO, quant-ph, 03B70, 18M45, 81P16, F.4.1"

High-level Stream Processing: A Complementary Analysis of Fault Recovery,"Adriano Vogel, S√∂ren Henning, Esteban Perez-Wohlfeil, Otmar Ertl, Rick Rabiser","Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems. Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style. Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing. Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds. In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities. We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform. The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance. However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them. Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups. We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them.

The OU$^2$ process: Characterising dissipative confinement in noisy   traps,"Luca Cocconi, Henry Alston, Jacopo Romano, Thibault Bertrand","The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process describes the dynamics of Brownian particles in a confining harmonic potential, thereby constituting the paradigmatic model of overdamped, mean-reverting Langevin dynamics. Despite its widespread applicability, this model falls short when describing physical systems where the confining potential is itself subjected to stochastic fluctuations. However, such stochastic fluctuations generically emerge in numerous situations, including in the context of colloidal manipulation by optical tweezers, leading to inherently out-of-equilibrium trapped dynamics. To explore the consequences of stochasticity at this level, we introduce a natural extension of the OU process, in which the stiffness of the harmonic potential is itself subjected to OU-like fluctuations. We call this model the OU$^2$ process. We examine its statistical, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties through a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Importantly, we show that the probability density for the particle position presents power-law tails, in contrast to the Gaussian decay of the standard OU process. In turn, this causes the trapping behavior, extreme value statistics, first passage statistics, and entropy production of the OU$^2$ process to differ qualitatively from their standard OU counterpart. Due to the wide applicability of the standard OU process and of the proposed OU$^2$ generalisation, our study sheds light on the peculiar properties of stochastic dynamics in random potentials and lays the foundation for the refined analysis of the dynamics and thermodynamics of numerous experimental systems.",2024-05-15T15:54:25Z,2024-05-15T15:54:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09460v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09460v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"
Early-Exit meets Model-Distributed Inference at Edge Networks,"Marco Colocrese, Erdem Koyuncu, Hulya Seferoglu","Distributed inference techniques can be broadly classified into data-distributed and model-distributed schemes. In data-distributed inference (DDI), each worker carries the entire deep neural network (DNN) model but processes only a subset of the data. However, feeding the data to workers results in high communication costs, especially when the data is large. An emerging paradigm is model-distributed inference (MDI), where each worker carries only a subset of DNN layers. In MDI, a source device that has data processes a few layers of DNN and sends the output to a neighboring device, i.e., offloads the rest of the layers. This process ends when all layers are processed in a distributed manner. In this paper, we investigate the design and development of MDI with early-exit, which advocates that there is no need to process all the layers of a model for some data to reach the desired accuracy, i.e., we can exit the model without processing all the layers if target accuracy is reached. We design a framework MDI-Exit that adaptively determines early-exit and offloading policies as well as data admission at the source. Experimental results on a real-life testbed of NVIDIA Nano edge devices show that MDI-Exit processes more data when accuracy is fixed and results in higher accuracy for the fixed data rate.",2024-08-08T11:53:32Z,2024-08-08T11:53:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05247v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05247v1,"cs.DC, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NI"

Decomposition of surprisal: Unified computational model of ERP   components in language processing,"Jiaxuan Li, Richard Futrell","The functional interpretation of language-related ERP components has been a central debate in psycholinguistics for decades. We advance an information-theoretic model of human language processing in the brain in which incoming linguistic input is processed at first shallowly and later with more depth, with these two kinds of information processing corresponding to distinct electroencephalographic signatures. Formally, we show that the information content (surprisal) of a word in context can be decomposed into two quantities: (A) shallow surprisal, which signals shallow processing difficulty for a word, and corresponds with the N400 signal; and (B) deep surprisal, which reflects the discrepancy between shallow and deep representations, and corresponds to the P600 signal and other late positivities. Both of these quantities can be estimated straightforwardly using modern NLP models. We validate our theory by successfully simulating ERP patterns elicited by a variety of linguistic manipulations in previously-reported experimental data from six experiments, with successful novel qualitative and quantitative predictions. Our theory is compatible with traditional cognitive theories assuming a `good-enough' shallow representation stage, but with a precise information-theoretic formulation.

However, their quadratic growth in computational and memory demands presents significant bottlenecks. Analog-Mixed-Signal Process-in-Memory (AMS-PiM) architectures address these challenges by enabling efficient on-chip processing. Traditionally, AMS-PiM relies on Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), which is hardware-efficient but requires extensive retraining to adapt models to AMS-PiMs, making it increasingly impractical for transformer models. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) mitigates this training overhead but introduces significant hardware inefficiencies. PTQ relies on dequantization-quantization (DQ-Q) processes, floating-point units (FPUs), and high-ENOB (Effective Number of Bits) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Particularly, High-ENOB ADCs scale exponentially in area and energy ($2^{ENOB}$), reduce sensing margins, and increase susceptibility to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, further compounding PTQ's challenges in AMS-PiM systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAP, an AMS-PiM architecture that eliminates DQ-Q processes, introduces FPU- and division-free nonlinear processing, and employs a low-ENOB-ADC-based sparse Matrix Vector multiplication technique. Using the proposed techniques, RAP improves error resiliency, area/energy efficiency, and computational speed while preserving numerical stability.

The results suggest that the model should be applied for theoretically designing the texture and quality of whipped cream and butter products. The modeling complexity in phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter was overcome by using a well-established complex systems approach, coupled map lattice (CML). The proposed CML consists of a minimal set of procedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), whipping, coalescence, and flocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables, surface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined on a two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known and different phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whipping temperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processes are at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments.

Dirac-Equation Signal Processing: Physics Boosts Topological Machine   Learning,"Runyue Wang, Yu Tian, Pietro Li√≤, Ginestra Bianconi","Topological signals are variables or features associated with both nodes and edges of a network.

Most of the previous topological signal processing algorithms treat node and edge signals separately and work under the hypothesis that the true signal is smooth and/or well approximated by a harmonic eigenvector of the Hodge-Laplacian, which may be violated in practice. Here we propose Dirac-equation signal processing, a framework for efficiently reconstructing true signals on nodes and edges, also if they are not smooth or harmonic, by processing them jointly. The proposed physics-inspired algorithm is based on the spectral properties of the topological Dirac operator. It leverages the mathematical structure of the topological Dirac equation to boost the performance of the signal processing algorithm. We discuss how the relativistic dispersion relation obeyed by the topological Dirac equation can be used to assess the quality of the signal reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of the algorithm with respect to previous algorithms. Specifically, we show that Dirac-equation signal processing can also be used efficiently if the true signal is a non-trivial linear combination of more than one eigenstate of the Dirac equation, as it generally occurs for real signals.",2024-12-06T15:38:58Z,2024-12-06T15:38:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05132v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05132v1,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.LG, cs.SI, physics.soc-ph, quant-ph"

Machine Learning for Identifying Grain Boundaries in Scanning Electron   Microscopy (SEM) Images of Nanoparticle Superlattices,"Aanish Paruchuri, Carl Thrasher, A. J. Hart, Robert Macfarlane, Arthi Jayaraman","Nanoparticle superlattices consisting of ordered arrangements of nanoparticles exhibit unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties arising from nanoparticle characteristics as well as their collective behaviors. Understanding how processing conditions influence the nanoscale arrangement and microstructure is critical for engineering materials with desired macroscopic properties. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries, lattice defects, and pores significantly affect these properties but are challenging to quantify using traditional manual analyses as they are labor-intensive and prone to errors. In this work, we present a machine learning workflow for automating grain segmentation in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanoparticle superlattices. This workflow integrates signal processing techniques, such as Radon transforms, with unsupervised learning methods like agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify and segment grains without requiring manually annotated data. In the workflow we transform the raw pixel data into explainable numerical representation of superlattice orientations for clustering. Benchmarking results demonstrate the workflow's robustness against noisy images and edge cases, with a processing speed of four images per minute on standard computational hardware. This efficiency makes the workflow scalable to large datasets and makes it a valuable tool for integrating data-driven models into decision-making processes for material design and analysis. For example, one can use this workflow to quantify grain size distributions at varying processing conditions like temperature and pressure and using that knowledge adjust processing conditions to achieve desired superlattice orientations and grain sizes.",2025-01-07T22:51:10Z,2025-01-07T22:51:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04172v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04172v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.CV, eess.IV"
BRiTE: Bootstrapping Reinforced Thinking Process to Enhance Language   Model Reasoning,"Han Zhong, Yutong Yin, Shenao Zhang, Xiaojun Xu, Yuanxin Liu, Yifei Zuo, Zhihan Liu, Boyi Liu, Sirui Zheng, Hongyi Guo, Liwei Wang, Mingyi Hong, Zhaoran Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet generating reliable reasoning processes remains a significant challenge. We present a unified probabilistic framework that formalizes LLM reasoning through a novel graphical model incorporating latent thinking processes and evaluation signals. Within this framework, we introduce the Bootstrapping Reinforced Thinking Process (BRiTE) algorithm, which works in two steps. First, it generates high-quality rationales by approximating the optimal thinking process through reinforcement learning, using a novel reward shaping mechanism. Second, it enhances the base LLM by maximizing the joint probability of rationale generation with respect to the model's parameters. Theoretically, we demonstrate BRiTE's convergence at a rate of $1/T$ with $T$ representing the number of iterations. Empirical evaluations on math and coding benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance across different base models without requiring human-annotated thinking processes. In addition, BRiTE demonstrates superior performance compared to existing algorithms that bootstrap thinking processes use alternative methods such as rejection sampling, and can even match or exceed the results achieved through supervised fine-tuning with human-annotated data.",2025-01-31T02:39:07Z,2025-01-31T02:39:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18858v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18858v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL"
Algebraic Signal Processing Theory,"Markus P√ºschel, Jos√© M. F. Moura","This paper presents an algebraic theory of linear signal processing. At the core of algebraic signal processing is the concept of a linear signal model defined as a triple (A, M, phi), where familiar concepts like the filter space and the signal space are cast as an algebra A and a module M, respectively, and phi generalizes the concept of the z-transform to bijective linear mappings from a vector space of, e.g., signal samples, into the module M. A signal model provides the structure for a particular linear signal processing application, such as infinite and finite discrete time, or infinite or finite discrete space, or the various forms of multidimensional linear signal processing. As soon as a signal model is chosen, basic ingredients follow, including the associated notions of filtering, spectrum, and Fourier transform. The shift operator is a key concept in the algebraic theory: it is the generator of the algebra of filters A. Once the shift is chosen, a well-defined methodology leads to the associated signal model. Different shifts correspond to infinite and finite time models with associated infinite and finite z-transforms, and to infinite and finite space models with associated infinite and finite C-transforms (that we introduce). In particular, we show that the 16 discrete cosine and sine transforms are Fourier transforms for the finite space models. Other definitions of the shift naturally lead to new signal models and to new transforms as associated Fourier transforms in one and higher dimensions, separable and non-separable. We explain in algebraic terms shift-invariance (the algebra of filters A is commutative), the role of boundary conditions and signal extensions, the connections between linear transforms and linear finite Gauss-Markov fields, and several other concepts and connections.",2006-12-15T20:01:11Z,2019-11-14T15:24:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0612077v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0612077v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, E.4"
A branching diffusion model of selection: from the neutral Wright-Fisher   case to the one including mutations,Thierry Huillet,"We consider diffusion processes x_{t} on the unit interval. Doob-transformation techniques consist of a selection of x_{t}-paths procedure. The law of the transformed process is the one of a branching diffusion system of particles, each diffusing like a new process tilde{x}_{t}, superposing an additional drift to the one of x_{t}. Killing and/or branching of tilde{x}_{t}-particles occur at some space-dependent rate lambda. For this transformed process, so in the class of branching diffusions, the question arises as to whether the particle system is sub-critical, critical or super-critical. In the first two cases, extinction occurs with probability one. We apply this circle of ideas to diffusion processes arising in population genetics. In this setup, the process x_{t} is a Wright-Fisher (WF) diffusion, either neutral or with mutations. We study a particular Doob transform which is based on the exponential function in the usual fitness parameter sigma. We have in mind that this is an alternative way to introduce selection or fitness in both WF-like diffusions, leading to branching diffusion models ideas. For this Doob-transform model of fitness, the usual selection drift sigma x(1-x) should be superposed to the one of x_{t} to form tilde{x}_{t} which is the process that can branch, binarily. In the first neutral case, there is a trade-off between branching events giving birth to new particles and absorption at the boundaries, killing the particles. Under our assumptions, the branching diffusion process gets eventually globally extinct in finite time with exponential tails. In the second case with mutations, there is a trade-off between killing events removing some particles from the system and reflection at the boundaries where the particles survive. This branching diffusion process also gets eventually globally extinct but in very long finite time with power-law tails. Our approach relies on the spectral expansion of the transition probability kernels of both x_{t} and tilde{x}_{t}.",2011-07-13T09:49:52Z,2011-07-13T09:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2504v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2504v1,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.PR"
Quantifying Information Overload in Social Media and its Impact on   Social Contagions,"Manuel Gomez Rodriguez, Krishna Gummadi, Bernhard Schoelkopf","Information overload has become an ubiquitous problem in modern society. Social media users and microbloggers receive an endless flow of information, often at a rate far higher than their cognitive abilities to process the information. In this paper, we conduct a large scale quantitative study of information overload and evaluate its impact on information dissemination in the Twitter social media site. We model social media users as information processing systems that queue incoming information according to some policies, process information from the queue at some unknown rates and decide to forward some of the incoming information to other users. We show how timestamped data about tweets received and forwarded by users can be used to uncover key properties of their queueing policies and estimate their information processing rates and limits. Such an understanding of users' information processing behaviors allows us to infer whether and to what extent users suffer from information overload.   Our analysis provides empirical evidence of information processing limits for social media users and the prevalence of information overloading. The most active and popular social media users are often the ones that are overloaded. Moreover, we find that the rate at which users receive information impacts their processing behavior, including how they prioritize information from different sources, how much information they process, and how quickly they process information. Finally, the susceptibility of a social media user to social contagions depends crucially on the rate at which she receives information. An exposure to a piece of information, be it an idea, a convention or a product, is much less effective for users that receive information at higher rates, meaning they need more exposures to adopt a particular contagion.",2014-03-26T20:01:04Z,2014-03-26T20:01:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6838v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6838v1,"cs.SI, physics.soc-ph, H.2.8"
Accelerating Science: A Computing Research Agenda,"Vasant G. Honavar, Mark D. Hill, Katherine Yelick","The emergence of ""big data"" offers unprecedented opportunities for not only accelerating scientific advances but also enabling new modes of discovery. Scientific progress in many disciplines is increasingly enabled by our ability to examine natural phenomena through the computational lens, i.e., using algorithmic or information processing abstractions of the underlying processes; and our ability to acquire, share, integrate and analyze disparate types of data. However, there is a huge gap between our ability to acquire, store, and process data and our ability to make effective use of the data to advance discovery. Despite successful automation of routine aspects of data management and analytics, most elements of the scientific process currently require considerable human expertise and effort. Accelerating science to keep pace with the rate of data acquisition and data processing calls for the development of algorithmic or information processing abstractions, coupled with formal methods and tools for modeling and simulation of natural processes as well as major innovations in cognitive tools for scientists, i.e., computational tools that leverage and extend the reach of human intellect, and partner with humans on a broad range of tasks in scientific discovery (e.g., identifying, prioritizing formulating questions, designing, prioritizing and executing experiments designed to answer a chosen question, drawing inferences and evaluating the results, and formulating new questions, in a closed-loop fashion).

A CLT for second difference estimators with an application to volatility   and intensity,"Emil A. Stoltenberg, Per A. Mykland, Lan Zhang","In this paper we introduce a general method for estimating the quadratic covariation of one or more spot parameters processes associated with continuous time semimartingales. This estimator is applicable to a wide range of spot parameter processes, and may also be used to estimate the leverage effect of stochastic volatility models. The estimator we introduce is based on sums of squared increments of second differences of the observed process, and the intervals over which the differences are computed are rolling and overlapping. This latter feature lets us take full advantage of the data, and, by sufficiency considerations, ought to outperform estimators that are only based on one partition of the observational window. The main result of the paper is a central limit theorem for such triangular array rolling quadratic variations. We highlight the wide applicability of this theorem by showcasing how it might be applied to a novel leverage effect estimator. The principal motivation for the present study, however, is that the discrete times at which a continuous time semimartingale is observed might depend on features of the observable process other than its level, such as its (non-observable) spot-volatility process. As the main application of our estimator, we therefore show how it may be used to estimate the quadratic covariation between the spot-volatility process and the intensity process of the observation times, when both of these are taken to be semimartingales. The finite sample properties of this estimator are studied by way of a simulation experiment, and we also apply this estimator in an empirical analysis of the Apple stock. Our analysis of the Apple stock indicates a rather strong correlation between the spot volatility process of the log-prices process and the times at which this stock is traded (hence observed).",2019-03-23T20:00:13Z,2020-11-25T15:51:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09873v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09873v3,"math.ST, stat.ME, stat.TH"
Text Classification of the Precursory Accelerating Seismicity Corpus:   Inference on some Theoretical Trends in Earthquake Predictability Research   from 1988 to 2018,Arnaud Mignan,"Text analytics based on supervised machine learning classifiers has shown great promise in a multitude of domains, but has yet to be applied to Seismology. We test various standard models (Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests) on a seismological corpus of 100 articles related to the topic of precursory accelerating seismicity, spanning from 1988 to 2010. This corpus was labelled in Mignan (2011) with the precursor whether explained by critical processes (i.e., cascade triggering) or by other processes (such as signature of main fault loading). We investigate rather the classification process can be automatized to help analyze larger corpora in order to better understand trends in earthquake predictability research. We find that the Naive Bayes model performs best, in agreement with the machine learning literature for the case of small datasets, with cross-validation accuracies of 86% for binary classification. For a refined multiclass classification ('non-critical process' < 'agnostic' < 'critical process assumed' < 'critical process demonstrated'), we obtain up to 78% accuracy. Prediction on a dozen of articles published since 2011 shows however a weak generalization with a F1-score of 60%, only slightly better than a random classifier, which can be explained by a change of authorship and use of different terminologies. Yet, the model shows F1-scores greater than 80% for the two multiclass extremes ('non-critical process' versus 'critical process demonstrated') while it falls to random classifier results (around 25%) for papers labelled 'agnostic' or 'critical process assumed'. Those results are encouraging in view of the small size of the corpus and of the high degree of abstraction of the labelling.

VAE-LIME: Deep Generative Model Based Approach for Local Data-Driven   Model Interpretability Applied to the Ironmaking Industry,"Cedric Schockaert, Vadim Macher, Alexander Schmitz","Machine learning applied to generate data-driven models are lacking of transparency leading the process engineer to lose confidence in relying on the model predictions to optimize his industrial process. Bringing processes in the industry to a certain level of autonomy using data-driven models is particularly challenging as the first user of those models, is the expert in the process with often decades of experience. It is necessary to expose to the process engineer, not solely the model predictions, but also their interpretability. To that end, several approaches have been proposed in the literature. The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method has gained a lot of interest from the research community recently. The principle of this method is to train a linear model that is locally approximating the black-box model, by generating randomly artificial data points locally. Model-agnostic local interpretability solutions based on LIME have recently emerged to improve the original method. We present in this paper a novel approach, VAE-LIME, for local interpretability of data-driven models forecasting the temperature of the hot metal produced by a blast furnace. Such ironmaking process data is characterized by multivariate time series with high inter-correlation representing the underlying process in a blast furnace. Our contribution is to use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn the complex blast furnace process characteristics from the data. The VAE is aiming at generating optimal artificial samples to train a local interpretable model better representing the black-box model in the neighborhood of the input sample processed by the black-box model to make a prediction. In comparison with LIME, VAE-LIME is showing a significantly improved local fidelity of the local interpretable linear model with the black-box model resulting in robust model interpretability.",2020-07-15T07:07:07Z,2020-07-15T07:07:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10256v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10256v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"
Identification of chicken egg fertility using SVM classifier based on   first-order statistical feature extraction,"Shoffan Saifullah, Andiko Putro Suryotomo","This study aims to identify chicken eggs fertility using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier method. The classification basis used the first-order statistical (FOS) parameters as feature extraction in the identification process. This research was developed based on the process's identification process, which is still manual (conventional). Although currently there are many technologies in the identification process, they still need development. Thus, this research is one of the developments in the field of image processing technology. The sample data uses datasets from previous studies with a total of 100 egg images. The egg object in the image is a single object. From these data, the classification of each fertile and infertile egg is 50 image data. Chicken egg image data became input in image processing, with the initial process is segmentation. This initial segmentation aims to get the cropped image according to the object. The cropped image is repaired using image preprocessing with grayscaling and image enhancement methods. This method (image enhancement) used two combination methods: contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and histogram equalization (HE). The improved image becomes the input for feature extraction using the FOS method. The FOS uses five parameters, namely mean, entropy, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. The five parameters entered into the SVM classifier method to identify the fertility of chicken eggs. The results of these experiments, the method proposed in the identification process has a success percentage of 84.57%. Thus, the implementation of this method can be used as a reference for future research improvements. In addition, it may be possible to use a second-order feature extraction method to improve its accuracy and improve supervised learning for classification.",2022-01-10T04:29:49Z,2022-01-10T04:29:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04063v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.04063v1,"cs.CV, eess.IV, 94A08, I.5.1; I.4.m"
Open Markov Processes and Reaction Networks,Blake S. Pollard,"We define the concept of an `open' Markov process, a continuous-time Markov chain equipped with specified boundary states through which probability can flow in and out of the system. External couplings which fix the probabilities of boundary states induce non-equilibrium steady states characterized by non-zero probability currents flowing through the system. We show that these non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call `dissipation.' This is closely related to Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production. We bound the rate of change of the entropy of a driven non-equilibrium steady state relative to the underlying equilibrium state in terms of the flow of probability through the boundary of the process.   We then consider open Markov processes as morphisms in a symmetric monoidal category by splitting up their boundary states into certain sets of `inputs' and `outputs.' Composition corresponds to gluing the outputs of one such open Markov process onto the inputs of another so that the probability flowing out of the first process is equal to the probability flowing into the second. We construct a `black-box' functor characterizing the behavior of an open Markov process in terms of the space of possible steady state probabilities and probability currents along the boundary. The fact that this is a functor means that the behavior of a composite open Markov process can be computed by composing the behaviors of the open Markov processes from which it is composed. We prove a similar black-boxing theorem for reaction networks whose dynamics are given by the non-linear rate equation. Along the way we describe a more general category of open dynamical systems where composition corresponds to gluing together open dynamical systems.",2017-09-27T21:46:15Z,2017-09-29T19:35:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09743v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09743v2,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.CT, math.MP, 18C10, 18D10, 93A30, 80A32, 60J27, 82C05, D.2.2; G.2.2; G.3"
Mixing it up: A general framework for Markovian statistics,"Niklas Dexheimer, Claudia Strauch, Lukas Trottner","Up to now, the nonparametric analysis of multidimensional continuous-time Markov processes has focussed strongly on specific model choices, mostly related to symmetry of the semigroup. While this approach allows to study the performance of estimators for the characteristics of the process in the minimax sense, it restricts the applicability of results to a rather constrained set of stochastic processes and in particular hardly allows incorporating jump structures. As a consequence, for many models of applied and theoretical interest, no statement can be made about the robustness of typical statistical procedures beyond the beautiful, but limited framework available in the literature. To close this gap, we identify $\beta$-mixing of the process and heat kernel bounds on the transition density as a suitable combination to obtain $\sup$-norm and $L^2$ kernel invariant density estimation rates matching the case of reversible multidimenisonal diffusion processes and outperforming density estimation based on discrete i.i.d. or weakly dependent data. Moreover, we demonstrate how up to $\log$-terms, optimal $\sup$-norm adaptive invariant density estimation can be achieved within our general framework based on tight uniform moment bounds and deviation inequalities for empirical processes associated to additive functionals of Markov processes. The underlying assumptions are verifiable with classical tools from stability theory of continuous time Markov processes and PDE techniques, which opens the door to evaluate statistical performance for a vast amount of Markov models. We highlight this point by showing how multidimensional jump SDEs with L\'evy driven jump part under different coefficient assumptions can be seamlessly integrated into our framework, thus establishing novel adaptive $\sup$-norm estimation rates for this class of processes.",2020-10-31T16:47:19Z,2021-06-23T07:26:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00308v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00308v3,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH, 62M05, 62G20, 60G10, 60J25"
Data Protection Impact Assessment for the Corona App,"Kirsten Bock, Christian R. K√ºhne, Rainer M√ºhlhoff, Mƒõto R. Ost, J√∂rg Pohle, Rainer Rehak","Since SARS-CoV-2 started spreading in Europe in early 2020, there has been a strong call for technical solutions to combat or contain the pandemic, with contact tracing apps at the heart of the debates. The EU's General Daten Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires controllers to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) where their data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms (Art. 35 GDPR). A DPIA is a structured risk analysis that identifies and evaluates possible consequences of data processing relevant to fundamental rights and describes the measures envisaged to address these risks or expresses the inability to do so. Based on the Standard Data Protection Model (SDM), we present a scientific DPIA which thoroughly examines three published contact tracing app designs that are considered to be the most ""privacy-friendly"": PEPP-PT, DP-3T and a concept summarized by Chaos Computer Club member Linus Neumann, all of which process personal health data. The DPIA starts with an analysis of the processing context and some expected use cases. Then, the processing activities are described by defining a realistic processing purpose. This is followed by the legal assessment and threshold analysis. Finally, we analyse the weak points, the risks and determine appropriate protective measures. We show that even decentralized implementations involve numerous serious weaknesses and risks. Legally, consent is unfit as legal ground hence data must be processed based on a law. We also found that measures to realize the rights of data subjects and affected people are not sufficient. Last but not least, we show that anonymization must be understood as a continuous process, which aims at separating the personal reference and is based on a mix of legal, organizational and technical measures.

A new class of conditional Markov jump processes with regime switching   and path dependence: properties and maximum likelihood estimation,Budhi Surya,"This paper develops a new class of conditional Markov jump processes with regime switching and paths dependence. The key novel feature of the developed process lies on its ability to switch the transition rate as it moves from one state to another with switching probability depending on the current state and time of the process as well as its past trajectories. As such, the transition from current state to another depends on the holding time of the process in the state. Distributional properties of the process are given explicitly in terms of the speed regimes represented by a finite number of different transition matrices, the probabilities of selecting regime membership within each state, and past realization of the process. In particular, it has distributional equivalent stochastic representation with a general mixture of Markov jump processes introduced in Frydman and Surya (2020). Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the distribution parameters of the process are derived in closed form. The estimation is done iteratively using the EM algorithm. Akaike information criterion is used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the selected model. An explicit observed Fisher information matrix of the MLE is derived for the calculation of standard errors of the MLE. The information matrix takes on a simplified form of the general matrix formula of Louis (1982). Large sample properties of the MLE are presented. In particular, the covariance matrix for the MLE of transition rates is equal to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, and is less for the MLE of regime membership. The simulation study confirms these findings and shows that the parameter estimates are accurate, consistent, and have asymptotic normality as the sample size increases.",2021-07-14T22:30:53Z,2021-07-14T22:30:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07026v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07026v1,"stat.ME, cs.IT, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.IT, q-fin.ST, 60J27, 60J28, 62M09, 62-08"
What makes Ethereum blockchain transactions be processed fast or slow?   An empirical study,"Michael Pacheco, Gustavo A. Oliva, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Ahmed E. Hassan","The Ethereum platform allows developers to implement and deploy applications called Dapps onto the blockchain for public use through the use of smart contracts. To execute code within a smart contract, a paid transaction must be issued towards one of the functions that are exposed in the interface of a contract. However, such a transaction is only processed once one of the miners in the peer-to-peer network selects it, adds it to a block, and appends that block to the blockchain This creates a delay between transaction submission and code execution. It is crucial for Dapp developers to be able to precisely estimate when transactions will be processed, since this allows them to define and provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS) level (e.g., 95% of the transactions processed within 1 minute). However, the impact that different factors have on these times have not yet been studied. Processing time estimation services are used by Dapp developers to achieve predefined QoS. Yet, these services offer minimal insights into what factors impact processing times. Considering the vast amount of data that surrounds the Ethereum blockchain, changes in processing times are hard for Dapp developers to predict, making it difficult to maintain said QoS. In our study, we build random forest models to understand the factors that are associated with transaction processing times. We engineer several features that capture blockchain internal factors, as well as gas pricing behaviors of transaction issuers. By interpreting our models, we conclude that features surrounding gas pricing behaviors are very strongly associated with transaction processing times. Based on our empirical results, we provide Dapp developers with concrete insights that can help them provide and maintain high levels of QoS.",2022-06-17T17:30:00Z,2022-06-17T17:30:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08905v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08905v1,"cs.SE, cs.DC, cs.NI"
Fluctuations-Induced Quantum Radiation and Reaction from an Atom in a   Squeezed Quantum Field,"Matthew Bravo, Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu","In this third of a series on quantum radiation, we explore the feasibility of using the memories kept in a quantum field to decipher certain information about the early universe. As a model study, we let a massless quantum field be subjected to a parametric process for a finite time interval such that the mode frequency of the field transits from one constant value to another. This configuration mimics a statically-bounded universe, but not a continuously evolving one. The field squeezed by this process should contain information of the process itself. If an atom is coupled to the field after the parametric process, its response will depend on the squeezing, and any quantum radiation emitted by the atom will carry this information away so that an observer at a much later time may still identify it. Our analyses show that 1) a remote observer cannot measure the generated squeezing via the radiation energy flux from the atom because the net radiation energy flux is canceled. However, 2) there is a chance to identify squeezing by measuring the constant radiation energy density at late times. The only restriction is that this energy density is of the near-field nature. The second part of this paper focuses on 3) the dependence of squeezing on the functional form of the parametric process. Via several examples we demonstrate that the behavior of squeezing reflect essential properties of the parametric process. In fact, striking features may show up in complicated processes involving various scales.

Timely Multi-Process Estimation Over Erasure Channels With and Without   Feedback: Signal-Independent Policies,"Karim Banawan, Ahmed Arafa, Karim G. Seddik","We consider a multi-process remote estimation system observing $K$ independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. In this system, a shared sensor samples the $K$ processes in such a way that the long-term average sum mean square error (MSE) is minimized using signal-independent sampling policies, in which sampling instances are chosen independently from the processes' values. The sensor operates under a total sampling frequency constraint $f_{\max}$. The samples from all processes consume random processing delays in a shared queue and then are transmitted over an erasure channel with probability $\epsilon$. We study two variants of the problem: first, when the samples are scheduled according to a Maximum-Age-First (MAF) policy, and the receiver provides an erasure status feedback; and second, when samples are scheduled according to a Round-Robin (RR) policy, when there is no erasure status feedback from the receiver. Aided by optimal structural results, we show that the optimal sampling policy for both settings, under some conditions, is a \emph{threshold policy}. We characterize the optimal threshold and the corresponding optimal long-term average sum MSE as a function of $K$, $f_{\max}$, $\epsilon$, and the statistical properties of the observed processes. Our results show that, with an exponentially distributed service rate, the optimal threshold $\tau^*$ increases as the number of processes $K$ increases, for both settings. Additionally, we show that the optimal threshold is an \emph{increasing} function of $\epsilon$ in the case of \emph{available} erasure status feedback, while it exhibits the \emph{opposite behavior}, i.e., $\tau^*$ is a \emph{decreasing} function of $\epsilon$, in the case of \emph{absent} erasure status feedback.",2023-03-23T17:51:46Z,2023-10-30T19:44:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13485v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13485v2,"cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.IT"
SHAMPOO: A stochastic model for tracking dust particles under the   influence of non-local disk processes,"M. Oosterloo, I. Kamp, W. van Westrenen, C. Dominik","The abundances of CHNOS are crucial for the composition of planets. At the onset of planet formation, large amounts of these elements are stored in ices on dust grains in planet-forming disks. The evolution of this ice is affected by dynamical transport, collisional processes, and the formation and sublimation of ice. We aim to constrain the disk regions where these processes are fully coupled, and develop a flexible modelling approach that is able to predict the effects of these processes acting simultaneously on the CHNOS budgets of the dust in these regions. We compared timescales associated with these disk processes to constrain the disk regions where this approach is necessary, and developed the SHAMPOO code, which tracks the CHNOS abundances in the ice mantle of a single monomer dust particle, embedded in a larger aggregate and undergoing these processes simultaneously. The adsorption and photodesorption of monomer ices depend on the depth of the monomer in the aggregate. We investigated the effect of fragmentation velocity and aggregate filling factor on the amount of ice on monomers residing at r = 10 AU. The locations where disk processes are fully coupled depend on both grain size and ice species. Monomers embedded in aggregates with fragmentation velocities of 1 m/s are able to undergo adsorption and photodesorption more often compared to a fragmentation velocity of 5 m/s or 10 m/s. Aggregates with a filling factor of $10^{-3}$ are able to accumulate ice 22 times faster on average than aggregates with a filling factor of 1. As different grain sizes are coupled through collisions and the grain ice consists of multiple ice species, it is difficult to isolate the locations where disk processes are fully coupled, necessitating the development of the SHAMPOO code. The processing of ice may not be spatially limited to dust aggregate surfaces for either fragile or porous aggregates.",2023-05-01T15:00:12Z,2023-05-01T15:00:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00861v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00861v1,"astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR"
Trade-Offs in Decentralized Multi-Antenna Architectures: Sparse   Combining Modules for WAX Decomposition,"Juan Vidal Alegr√≠a, Fredrik Rusek","With the increase in the number of antennas at base stations (BSs), centralized multi-antenna architectures have encountered scalability problems from excessive interconnection bandwidth to the central processing unit (CPU), as well as increased processing complexity. Thus, research efforts have been directed towards finding decentralized receiver architectures where a part of the processing is performed at the antenna end (or close to it). A recent paper put forth an information-lossless trade-off between level of decentralization (inputs to CPU) and decentralized processing complexity (multiplications per antenna). This trade-off was obtained by studying a newly defined matrix decomposition--the WAX decomposition--which is directly related to the information-lossless processing that should to be applied in a general framework to exploit the trade-off. {The general framework consists of three stages: a set of decentralized filters, a linear combining module, and a processing matrix applied at the CPU; these three stages are linear transformations which can be identified with the three constituent matrices of the WAX decomposition. The previous work was unable to provide explicit constructions for linear combining modules which are valid for WAX decomposition, while it remarked the importance of these modules being sparse with 1s and 0s so they could be efficiently implemented using hardware accelerators.} In this work we present a number of constructions, as well as possible variations of them, for effectively defining linear combining modules which can be used in the WAX decomposition. Furthermore, we show how these structures facilitate decentralized calculation of the WAX decomposition for applying information-lossless processing in architectures with an arbitrary level of decentralization.",2023-09-08T12:40:41Z,2023-09-08T12:40:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04297v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04297v1,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"
"Stochastic and Boltzmann-like models for behavioral changes, and their   relation to game theory",Dirk Helbing,"In the last decade, stochastic models have shown to be very useful for quantitative modelling of social processes. Here, a configurational master equation for the description of behavioral changes by pair interactions of individuals is developed. Three kinds of social pair interactions are distinguished: Avoidance processes, compromising processes, and imitative processes. Computational results are presented for a special case of imitative processes: the competition of two equivalent strategies. They show a phase transition that describes the selforganization of a behavioral convention. This phase transition is further analyzed by examining the equations for the most probable behavioral distribution, which are Boltzmann-like equations. Special cases of Boltzmann-like equations do not obey the H-theorem and have oscillatory or even chaotic solutions. A suitable Taylor approximation leads to the socalled game dynamical equations (also known as selection-mutation equations in the theory of evolution).",1998-05-22T15:10:58Z,1998-05-22T15:10:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9805293v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9805293v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, chao-dyn, nlin.CD"
Non-exponential time-correlation function for random physical processes,T. R. S. Prasanna,The exponential correlation function is theoretically incorrect in the entire frequency range of interest for processes described in terms of linear response theory. The Lorentzian lineshape results from an inconsistent assumption of exponential correlation at timescales smaller than the relaxation time. A new correlation function is proposed that avoids the deficiencies of the exponential function. Comparison on dielectric relaxation in gases shows that the new correlation function can be used to fit data satisfactorily instead of the exponential function. The new correlation function is theoretically consistent for all processes described in terms of linear response theory. Its additional mathematical superiority implies that it can be used instead of the exponential function for all such processes.,2004-11-22T14:25:28Z,2005-02-28T13:07:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0411553v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0411553v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.chem-ph, physics.data-an"

As an example, autoregressive model fitting with a monotonic variance function is discussed in detail, including algorithmic considerations.

In econometrics, this can be interpreted as a nonlinear cointegration type relationship, but we believe that our results are of wider interest. The class of nonstationary processes allowed for $\{X_t\}$ is a subclass of the class of null recurrent Markov chains. This subclass contains random walk, unit root processes and nonlinear processes.

One of its primary functions is matter transport among different parts of the organism including tissue supplying with oxygen, carbon dioxide excretion, drug propagation etc. Forecasting of these processes under normal conditions and in the presence of different pathologies like atherosclerosis, loss of blood, anatomical abnormalities, pathological changing in chemical transformations and others is significant issue for many physiologists. In this connection should be pointed out that global processes are of special interest as they include feedbacks and interdependences among different regions of the organism.

Calculations of Sobol indices for the Gaussian process metamodel,"Amandine Marrel, Bertrand Iooss, Beatrice Laurent, Olivier Roustant","Global sensitivity analysis of complex numerical models can be performed by calculating variance-based importance measures of the input variables, such as the Sobol indices. However, these techniques, requiring a large number of model evaluations, are often unacceptable for time expensive computer codes. A well known and widely used decision consists in replacing the computer code by a metamodel, predicting the model responses with a negligible computation time and rending straightforward the estimation of Sobol indices. In this paper, we discuss about the Gaussian process model which gives analytical expressions of Sobol indices. Two approaches are studied to compute the Sobol indices: the first based on the predictor of the Gaussian process model and the second based on the global stochastic process model. Comparisons between the two estimates, made on analytical examples, show the superiority of the second approach in terms of convergence and robustness. Moreover, the second approach allows to integrate the modeling error of the Gaussian process model by directly giving some confidence intervals on the Sobol indices.

Starting from a phenomenological stationary Langevin description with multiplicative noise processes, we have investigated the Kramers' theory for activated rate processes in a nonequilibrium open system (one-dimensional in nature) driven by two external cross-correlated noise processes which are Gaussian, stationary and delta correlated. Based on the Fokker-Planck description in phase space, we then derive the escape rate from a metastable state in the moderate to large friction limit to study the effect of degree of correlation on the same. By employing numerical simulation in the presence of external cross-correlated additive and multiplicative noises we check the validity of our analytical formalism for constant dissipation, which shows a satisfactory agreement between both the approaches for the specific choice of noise processes.

For every positive frequency, this estimator is proved to satisfy a central limit theorem with a convergence rate depending on the roughness of the process and the moment of random durations between successive observations.

The improvement to the known models by taking into account different scheme of claims payment and the possibility of rejection of the request by the insurance company is made.

Invariance principles for linear processes with application to isotonic   regression,"J√©r√¥me Dedecker, Florence Merlev√®de, Magda Peligrad","In this paper, we prove maximal inequalities and study the functional central limit theorem for the partial sums of linear processes generated by dependent innovations. Due to the general weights, these processes can exhibit long-range dependence and the limiting distribution is a fractional Brownian motion. The proofs are based on new approximations by a linear process with martingale difference innovations. The results are then applied to study an estimator of the isotonic regression when the error process is a (possibly long-range dependent) time series.",2009-03-11T11:27:55Z,2011-03-18T13:42:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1951v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.1951v2,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH"
Simplicity of Completion Time Distributions for Common Complex   Biochemical Processes,"Golan Bel, Brian Munsky, Ilya Nemenman","Biochemical processes typically involve huge numbers of individual reversible steps, each with its own dynamical rate constants. For example, kinetic proofreading processes rely upon numerous sequential reactions in order to guarantee the precise construction of specific macromolecules. In this work, we study the transient properties of such systems and fully characterize their first passage (completion) time distributions. In particular, we provide explicit expressions for the mean and the variance of the completion time for a kinetic proofreading process and computational analyses for more complicated biochemical systems. We find that, for a wide range of parameters, as the system size grows, the completion time behavior simplifies: it becomes either deterministic or exponentially distributed, with a very narrow transition between the two regimes. In both regimes, the dynamical complexity of the full system is trivial compared to its apparent structural complexity. Similar simplicity is likely to arise in the dynamics of many complex multi-step biochemical processes. In particular, these findings suggest not only that one may not be able to understand individual elementary reactions from macroscopic observations, but also that such understanding may be unnecessary.",2009-04-09T19:15:50Z,2009-08-28T16:26:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1587v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.1587v2,"q-bio.MN, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.QM"
Levy flights in confining potentials,"Piotr Garbaczewski, Vladimir Stephanovich","We analyze confining mechanisms for L\'{e}vy flights. When they evolve in suitable external potentials their variance may exist and show signatures of a superdiffusive transport. Two classes of stochastic jump - type processes are considered: those driven by Langevin equation with L\'{e}vy noise and those, named by us topological L\'{e}vy processes (occurring in systems with topological complexity like folded polymers or complex networks and generically in inhomogeneous media), whose Langevin representation is unknown and possibly nonexistent. Our major finding is that both above classes of processes stay in affinity and may share common stationary (eventually asymptotic) probability density, even if their detailed dynamical behavior look different. That generalizes and offers new solutions to a reverse engineering (e.g. targeted stochasticity) problem due to I. Eliazar and J. Klafter [J. Stat. Phys. 111, 739, (2003)]: design a L\'{e}vy process whose target pdf equals a priori preselected one.

On the functional central limit theorem via martingale approximation,"Mikhail Gordin, Magda Peligrad","In this paper, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of a martingale approximation for the partial sums of a stationary process in terms of the maximum of consecutive errors. Such an approximation is useful for transferring the conditional functional central limit theorem from the martingale to the original process. The condition found is simple and well adapted to a variety of examples, leading to a better understanding of the structure of several stochastic processes and their asymptotic behaviors. The approximation brings together many disparate examples in probability theory. It is valid for classes of variables defined by familiar projection conditions such as the Maxwell--Woodroofe condition, various classes of mixing processes, including the large class of strongly mixing processes, and for additive functionals of Markov chains with normal or symmetric Markov operators.",2009-10-19T03:42:29Z,2011-02-10T07:21:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3448v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.3448v3,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"

All these diffusions are broadly used in mathematical finance for modelling asset prices, market indices, and interest rates. We show how the probability distributions of a squared Bessel bridge and a squared Bessel process with or without absorption at zero are reduced to randomized gamma distributions. Moreover, for absorbing stochastic processes, we develop a new bridge sampling technique based on conditioning on the first hitting time at zero. Such an approach allows us to simplify simulation schemes.

The observation consists in a finite sample path of the process. Using a random projection technique introduced and studied in Cuesta-Albertos et al. 2007 in the frame of goodness of fit test for functional data, we perform some decision rules. These rules really stand on the whole distribution of the process and not only on its marginal distribution at a fixed order.

Variations and Hurst index estimation for a Rosenblatt process using   longer filters,"Alexandra Chronopoulou, Ciprian Tudor, Frederi Viens","The Rosenblatt process is a self-similar non-Gaussian process which lives in second Wiener chaos, and occurs as the limit of correlated random sequences in so-called \textquotedblleft non-central limit theorems\textquotedblright. It shares the same covariance as fractional Brownian motion. We study the asymptotic distribution of the quadratic variations of the Rosenblatt process based on long filters, including filters based on high-order finite-difference and wavelet-based schemes. We find exact formulas for the limiting distributions, which we then use to devise strongly consistent estimators of the self-similarity parameter $H$.

Investigating modularity in the analysis of process algebra models of   biochemical systems,"Federica Ciocchetta, Maria Luisa Guerriero, Jane Hillston","Compositionality is a key feature of process algebras which is often cited as one of their advantages as a modelling technique. It is certainly true that in biochemical systems, as in many other systems, model construction is made easier in a formalism which allows the problem to be tackled compositionally. In this paper we consider the extent to which the compositional structure which is inherent in process algebra models of biochemical systems can be exploited during model solution. In essence this means using the compositional structure to guide decomposed solution and analysis.   Unfortunately the dynamic behaviour of biochemical systems exhibits strong interdependencies between the components of the model making decomposed solution a difficult task. Nevertheless we believe that if such decomposition based on process algebras could be established it would demonstrate substantial benefits for systems biology modelling.

We show that this problem is closely related to the problem of composite function estimation that has recently gotten much attention in statistical literature. Under suitable identifiability conditions, we propose a consistent estimate for the L\'{e}vy density of $L_t$ and derive the uniform as well as the pointwise convergence rates of the estimate proposed. Moreover, we prove that the rates obtained are optimal in a minimax sense over suitable classes of time-changed L\'{e}vy models.

Learning by random walks in the weight space of the Ising perceptron,"Haiping Huang, Haijun Zhou","Several variants of a stochastic local search process for constructing the synaptic weights of an Ising perceptron are studied. In this process, binary patterns are sequentially presented to the Ising perceptron and are then learned as the synaptic weight configuration is modified through a chain of single- or double-weight flips within the compatible weight configuration space of the earlier learned patterns. This process is able to reach a storage capacity of $\alpha \approx 0.63$ for pattern length N = 101 and $\alpha \approx 0.41$ for N = 1001. If in addition a relearning process is exploited, the learning performance is further improved to a storage capacity of $\alpha \approx 0.80$ for N = 101 and $\alpha \approx 0.42$ for N=1001. We found that, for a given learning task, the solutions constructed by the random walk learning process are separated by a typical Hamming distance, which decreases with the constraint density $\alpha$ of the learning task; at a fixed value of $\alpha$, the width of the Hamming distance distributions decreases with $N$.",2010-03-04T11:38:33Z,2010-05-30T03:44:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1020v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1020v2,"cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.LG, q-bio.NC"

An approach similar to the one presented in [1-3] for classical Markov chains is taken to bound the trace-distance from the steady state of a quantum processes. A strict spectral bound to the convergence rate can be given for time-discrete as well as for time-continuous quantum Markov processes. Furthermore the contractive behavior of the $\chi^2$-divergence under the action of a completely positive map is investigated and contrasted to the contraction of the trace norm.

Suppressed dispersion for a randomly kicked quantum particle in a Dirac   comb,Jeremy Thane Clark,"I study a model for a massive one-dimensional particle in a singular periodic potential that is receiving kicks from a gas. The model is described by a Lindblad equation in which the Hamiltonian is a Schr\""odinger operator with a periodic $\delta$-potential and the noise has a frictionless form arising in a Brownian limit. I prove that an emergent Markov process in a semi-classical limit governs the momentum distribution in the extended-zone scheme. The main result is a central limit theorem for a time integral of the momentum process, which is closely related to the particle's position. When normalized by $t^{5/4}$, the integral process converges to a time-changed Brownian motion whose rate depends on the momentum process. The scaling $t^{5/4}$ contrasts with $t^{3/2}$, which would be expected for the case of a smooth periodic potential or for a comparable classical process.

Next, the properties of the spontaneous process of collecting purposeful information are investigated. In effect, the properties of this process: the goal 'continuation of existence', reproduction and Darwinian mechanism are derived which suggest, that it is the natural life process. A 'natural identity criterion' appears in this process for an evolving object, that is connected to a 'small change tendency'. Likewise, 'hereditary information' is defined.

It is to emphasize that parameters of the reduced point include not only volume flow, speed and polytropic head, for which a requirement of similarity of flow at inlet is sufficient, but also polytropic exponent, polytropic efficiency, outlet pressure and outlet temperature.

"Ancestral branching, cut-and-paste algorithms and associated tree and   partition-valued processes",Harry Crane,"We introduce an algorithm for generating a random sequence of fragmentation trees, which we call the ancestral branching algorithm. This algorithm builds on the recursive partitioning structure of a tree and gives rise to an associated family of Markovian transition kernels whose finite-dimensional transition probabilities can be written in closed-form as the product over partition-valued Markov kernels. The associated tree-valued Markov process is infinitely exchangeable provided its associated partition-valued kernel is infinitely exchangeable. We also identify a transition procedure on partitions, called the cut-and-paste algorithm, which corresponds to a previously studied partition-valued Markov process on partitions with a bounded number of blocks. Specifically, we discuss the corresponding family of tree-valued Markov kernels generated by the combination of both the ancestral branching and cut-and-paste transition probabilities and show results for the equilibrium measure of this process, as well as its associated mass fragmentation-valued and weighted tree-valued processes.",2011-07-12T23:06:02Z,2011-11-01T19:52:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2433v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2433v2,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
O'Connell's process as a vicious Brownian motion,Makoto Katori,"Vicious Brownian motion is a diffusion scaling limit of Fisher's vicious walk model, which is a system of Brownian particles in one dimension such that if two of them meet they kill each other. We consider the vicious Brownian motion conditioned never to collide with each other, and call it the noncolliding Brownian motion. This conditional diffusion process is equivalent to the eigenvalue process of a Hermitian-matrix-valued Brownian motion studied by Dyson. Recently O'Connell introduced a generalization of the noncolliding Brownian motion by using the eigenfunctions (the Whittaker functions) of the quantum Toda lattice in order to analyze a directed polymer model in 1+1 dimensions. We consider a system of one-dimensional Brownian motions with a long-ranged killing term as a generalization of the vicious Brownian motion and construct the O'Connell process as a conditional process of the killing Brownian motions to survive forever.",2011-10-09T14:37:02Z,2011-12-10T00:28:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1845v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1845v2,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, math.MP, math.PR, nlin.SI"
Symmetric Rearrangements Around Infinity with Applications to Levy   Processes,"Alexander Drewitz, Perla Sousi, Rongfeng Sun","We prove a new rearrangement inequality for multiple integrals, which partly generalizes a result of Friedberg and Luttinger (1976) and can be interpreted as involving symmetric rearrangements of domains around infinity. As applications, we prove two comparison results for general Levy processes and their symmetric rearrangements. The first application concerns the survival probability of a point particle in a Poisson field of moving traps following independent Levy motions. We show that the survival probability can only increase if the point particle does not move, and the traps and the Levy motions are symmetrically rearranged. This essentially generalizes an isoperimetric inequality of Peres and Sousi (2011) for the Wiener sausage. In the second application, we show that the q-capacity of a Borel measurable set for a Levy process can only decrease if the set and the Levy process are symmetrically rearranged. This result generalizes an inequality obtained by Watanabe (1983) for symmetric Levy processes.",2011-10-25T17:52:38Z,2013-02-05T01:26:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5592v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.5592v2,"math.PR, math.FA, 26D15, 60J65, 60D05, 60G55, 60G50"
Going off grid: Computationally efficient inference for log-Gaussian Cox   processes,"Daniel Simpson, Janine Illian, Finn Lindgren, Sigrunn S√∏rbye, H√•vard Rue","This paper introduces a new method for performing computational inference on log-Gaussian Cox processes. The likelihood is approximated directly by making novel use of a continuously specified Gaussian random field. We show that for sufficiently smooth Gaussian random field prior distributions, the approximation can converge with arbitrarily high order, while an approximation based on a counting process on a partition of the domain only achieves first-order convergence. The given results improve on the general theory of convergence of the stochastic partial differential equation models, introduced by Lindgren et al. (2011). The new method is demonstrated on a standard point pattern data set and two interesting extensions to the classical log-Gaussian Cox process framework are discussed. The first extension considers variable sampling effort throughout the observation window and implements the method of Chakraborty et al. (2011). The second extension constructs a log-Gaussian Cox process on the world's oceans. The analysis is performed using integrated nested Laplace approximation for fast approximate inference.",2011-11-01T17:56:10Z,2015-10-30T18:46:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0641v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0641v3,"stat.CO, math.ST, stat.AP, stat.TH"
Two-time scale subordination in physical processes with long-term memory,"Aleksander Stanislavsky, Karina Weron","We use the two-time scale subordination in order to describe dynamical processes in continuous media with a long-term memory. Our consideration touches two physical examples in detail. First we study a temporal evolution of the species concentration for the trapping reaction in which a diffusing reactant is surrounded by a sea of randomly moving traps. The analysis is based on the random-variable formalism of anomalous diffusive processes. We find that the empirical trapping-reaction law, according to which the reactant concentration decreases in time as a product of an exponential and a stretched exponential function, can be explained by the two-time scale subordination of random processes. Another example is connected with a state equation for continuous media with memory. If the pressure and the density of a medium are subordinated in two different random processes, then the ordinary state equation becomes fractional with two time scales. This allows one to arrive at the state equation of Bagley-Torvik type.",2011-11-14T12:32:25Z,2011-11-14T12:32:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3192v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.3192v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.soft, physics.flu-dyn"
Convergence of Achlioptas processes via differential equations with   unique solutions,"Oliver Riordan, Lutz Warnke","In Achlioptas processes, starting from an empty graph, in each step two potential edges are chosen uniformly at random, and using some rule one of them is selected and added to the evolving graph. The evolution of the rescaled size of the largest component in such variations of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph process has recently received considerable attention, in particular for for Bollob\'as's `product rule'. In this paper we establish the following result for rules such as the product rule: the limit of the rescaled size of the `giant' component exists and is continuous provided that a certain system of differential equations has a unique solution. In fact, our result applies to a very large class of Achlioptas-like processes.   Our proof relies on a general idea which relates the evolution of stochastic processes to an associated system of differential equations. Provided that the latter has a unique solution, our approach shows that certain discrete quantities converge (after appropriate rescaling) to this solution.",2011-11-26T17:57:05Z,2013-06-27T11:50:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6179v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.6179v2,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.CO, 60C05, 05C80"
Erd√©lyi-Kober Fractional Diffusion,Gianni Pagnini,"The aim of this Short Note is to highlight that the {\it generalized grey Brownian motion} (ggBm) is an anomalous diffusion process driven by a fractional integral equation in the sense of Erd\'elyi-Kober, and for this reason here it is proposed to call such family of diffusive processes as {\it Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional diffusion}. The ggBm is a parametric class of stochastic processes that provides models for both fast and slow anomalous diffusion. This class is made up of self-similar processes with stationary increments and it depends on two real parameters: $0 < \alpha \le 2$ and $0 < \beta \le 1$. It includes the fractional Brownian motion when $0 < \alpha \le 2$ and $\beta=1$, the time-fractional diffusion stochastic processes when $0 < \alpha=\beta <1$, and the standard Brownian motion when $\alpha=\beta=1$.

Permutation Complexity via Duality between Values and Orderings,"Taichi Haruna, Kohei Nakajima","We study the permutation complexity of finite-state stationary stochastic processes based on a duality between values and orderings between values. First, we establish a duality between the set of all words of a fixed length and the set of all permutations of the same length. Second, on this basis, we give an elementary alternative proof of the equality between the permutation entropy rate and the entropy rate for a finite-state stationary stochastic processes first proved in [Amigo, J.M., Kennel, M.

Third, we show that further information on the relationship between the structure of values and the structure of orderings for finite-state stationary stochastic processes beyond the entropy rate can be obtained from the established duality. In particular, we prove that the permutation excess entropy is equal to the excess entropy, which is a measure of global correlation present in a stationary stochastic process, for finite-state stationary ergodic Markov processes.",2011-12-12T09:23:01Z,2011-12-12T09:23:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2475v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.2475v1,"nlin.CD, cs.IT, math.IT, physics.data-an"

Comparing network covers using mutual information,"Alcides Viamontes Esquivel, Martin Rosvall","In network science, researchers often use mutual information to understand the difference between network partitions produced by community detection methods. Here we extend the use of mutual information to covers, that is, the cases where a node can belong to more than one module. In our proposed solution, the underlying stochastic process used to compare partitions is extended to deal with covers, and the random variables of the new process are simply fed into the usual definition of mutual information. With partitions, our extended process behaves exactly as the conventional approach for partitions, and thus, the mutual information values obtained are the same. We also describe how to perform sampling and do error estimation for our extended process, as both are necessary steps for a practical application of this measure. The stochastic process that we define here is not only applicable to networks, but can also be used to compare more general set-to-set binary relations.",2012-02-02T13:13:58Z,2012-02-02T13:13:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0425v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.0425v1,"math-ph, cs.IT, math.IT, math.MP, physics.data-an"

We show that for any process in the MDA of the frequently used H\""usler-Reiss model or its spatial extension, the Brown-Resnick process, suitably defined conditional increments asymptotically follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This leads to computationally efficient estimates of the H\""usler-Reiss parameter matrix. Further, the results enable parametric inference for Brown-Resnick processes.

These QCD factorization theorem is an important tool in the description of hard processes in QCD. Whenever valid, it permits to represent the cross section or the scattering amplitude for such a process as a convolution in partonic momenta of a perturbatively calculable part (the coefficient function, CF) which involves the hard scale of the process with non-perturbative (soft) distributions of active partons inside the hadrons involved in a process. The reliability of the perturbatively determined hard part together with high precision experimental data on relevant observables gives a hope for the possibility to uncover fine details of interpartonic interactions and spatial distributions of partons inside hadrons.

In our model we do not take any microscopic mechanism of the dissolution process into account, but rather provide an estimate which is based on easy-to-follow calculations. Having obtained a description based on this calculation, we confirm the assumed behavior by providing experimental data of the dissolution process. Besides a deviation from our prediction caused by the production process of the candies below a diameter of 2 mm, we find good agreement with our model-based expectations.

Complex social contagion makes networks more vulnerable to disease   outbreaks,"Ellsworth Campbell, Marcel Salath√©","Social network analysis is now widely used to investigate the dynamics of infectious disease spread from person to person. Vaccination dramatically disrupts the disease transmission process on a contact network, and indeed, sufficiently high vaccination rates can disrupt the process to such an extent that disease transmission on the network is effectively halted. Here, we build on mounting evidence that health behaviors - such as vaccination, and refusal thereof - can spread through social networks through a process of complex contagion that requires social reinforcement. Using network simulations that model both the health behavior and the infectious disease spread, we find that under otherwise identical conditions, the process by which the health behavior spreads has a very strong effect on disease outbreak dynamics. This variability in dynamics results from differences in the topology within susceptible communities that arise during the health behavior spreading process, which in turn depends on the topology of the overall social network.

Nearest neighbor Markov dynamics on Macdonald processes,"Alexei Borodin, Leonid Petrov","Macdonald processes are certain probability measures on two-dimensional arrays of interlacing particles introduced by Borodin and Corwin (arXiv:1111.4408 [math.PR]). They are defined in terms of nonnegative specializations of the Macdonald symmetric functions and depend on two parameters (q,t), where 0<= q, t < 1. Our main result is a classification of continuous time, nearest neighbor Markov dynamics on the space of interlacing arrays that act nicely on Macdonald processes.   The classification unites known examples of such dynamics and also yields many new ones. When t = 0, one dynamics leads to a new integrable interacting particle system on the one-dimensional lattice, which is a q-deformation of the PushTASEP (= long-range TASEP). When q = t, the Macdonald processes become the Schur processes of Okounkov and Reshetikhin (arXiv:math/0107056 [math.CO]). In this degeneration, we discover new Robinson--Schensted-type correspondences between words and pairs of Young tableaux that govern some of our dynamics.",2013-05-23T17:57:26Z,2013-05-23T17:57:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5501v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5501v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.CO, math.MP, math.RT"
Dynamical interplay between awareness and epidemic spreading in   multiplex networks,"Clara Granell, Sergio Gomez, Alex Arenas","We present the analysis of the interrelation between two processes accounting for the spreading of an epidemics, and the information awareness to prevent its infection, on top of multiplex networks. This scenario is representative of an epidemic process spreading on a network of persistent real contacts, and a cyclic information awareness process diffusing in the network of virtual social contacts between the same individuals. The topology corresponds to a multiplex network where two diffusive processes are interacting affecting each other. The analysis using a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) reveals the phase diagram of the incidence of the epidemics and allows to capture the evolution of the epidemic threshold depending on the topological structure of the multiplex and the interrelation with the awareness process. Interestingly, the critical point for the onset of the epidemics has a critical value (meta-critical point) defined by the awareness dynamics and the topology of the virtual network, from which the onset increases and the epidemics incidence decreases.",2013-06-18T10:42:29Z,2013-09-19T19:03:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4136v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4136v2,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.SI"
Posterior Contraction Rates of the Phylogenetic Indian Buffet Processes,"Mengjie Chen, Chao Gao, Hongyu Zhao","By expressing prior distributions as general stochastic processes, nonparametric Bayesian methods provide a flexible way to incorporate prior knowledge and constrain the latent structure in statistical inference. The Indian buffet process (IBP) is such an example that can be used to define a prior distribution on infinite binary features, where the exchangeability among subjects is assumed. The phylogenetic Indian buffet process (pIBP), a derivative of IBP, enables the modeling of non-exchangeability among subjects through a stochastic process on a rooted tree, which is similar to that used in phylogenetics, to describe relationships among the subjects. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of IBP and pIBP under a binary factor model. We establish the posterior contraction rates for both IBP and pIBP and substantiate the theoretical results through simulation studies. This is the first work addressing the frequentist property of the posterior behaviors of IBP and pIBP. We also demonstrated its practical usefulness by applying pIBP prior to a real data example arising in the field of cancer genomics where the exchangeability among subjects is violated.",2013-07-31T05:56:20Z,2015-05-19T20:02:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8229v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.8229v2,"stat.ML, math.ST, q-bio.QM, stat.AP, stat.TH"
Cytoplasmic Streaming in Plant Cells Emerges Naturally by Microfilament   Self-Organization,"Francis G. Woodhouse, Raymond E. Goldstein","Many cells exhibit large-scale active circulation of their entire fluid contents, a process termed cytoplasmic streaming. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in plant cells, often presenting strikingly regimented flow patterns. The driving mechanism in such cells is known: myosin-coated organelles entrain cytoplasm as they process along actin filament bundles fixed at the periphery. Still unknown, however, is the developmental process which constructs the well-ordered actin configurations required for coherent cell-scale flow. Previous experimental works on streaming regeneration in cells of Characean algae, whose longitudinal flow is perhaps the most regimented of all, hint at an autonomous process of microfilament self-organization driving the formation of streaming patterns during morphogenesis. Working from first principles, we propose a robust model of streaming emergence that combines motor dynamics with both micro- and macroscopic hydrodynamics to explain how several independent processes, each ineffectual on its own, can reinforce to ultimately develop the patterns of streaming observed in the Characeae and other streaming species.",2013-08-29T10:26:55Z,2013-08-29T10:26:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6422v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6422v1,"cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.CB"
Initial conformation of kinesin's neck linker,"Yi-Zhao Geng, Qing Ji, Shu-Xia Liu, Shiwei Yan","How ATP binding initiates the docking process of kinesin's neck linker is a key question in understanding kinesin mechanism. It is believed that the formation of an extra turn structure by the first three amino acids of neck linker (LYS325, THR326, ILE327 in 2KIN) is crucial for initiating the docking process. But the initial conformation of neck linker (specially the three amino acids of the extra turn) and the neck linker docking initiation mechanism remain unclear. By using molecular dynamics method, we investigate the initial conformation of kinesin's neck linker in the docking process. We find that, in the initial state of NL docking process, NL still has interactions with {\beta}0 and forms a conformation similar to the ""cover-neck bundle"" structure proposed by Hwang et al. [Structure 2008, 16(1): 62-71]. From this initial structure, the docking of the ""cover-neck bundle"" structure can be achieved. The motor head provides a forward force on the initial cover-neck bundle structure through ATP-induced rotation. This force, together with the hydrophobic interaction of ILE327 with the hydrophobic pocket on the motor head, drives the formation of the extra turn and initiates the neck linker docking process.",2013-09-20T05:01:50Z,2013-09-20T05:01:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5173v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.5173v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft, q-bio.BM"
Controlling Contagion Processes in Time-Varying Networks,"Suyu Liu, Nicola Perra, Marton Karsai, Alessandro Vespignani","The vast majority of strategies aimed at controlling contagion processes on networks considers the connectivity pattern of the system as either quenched or annealed. However, in the real world many networks are highly dynamical and evolve in time concurrently to the contagion process. Here, we derive an analytical framework for the study of control strategies specifically devised for time-varying networks. We consider the removal/immunization of individual nodes according the their activity in the network and develop a block variable mean-field approach that allows the derivation of the equations describing the evolution of the contagion process concurrently to the network dynamic. We derive the critical immunization threshold and assess the effectiveness of the control strategies. Finally, we validate the theoretical picture by simulating numerically the information spreading process and control strategies in both synthetic networks and a large-scale, real-world mobile telephone call dataset",2013-09-26T19:50:15Z,2013-09-26T19:50:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7031v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7031v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI, q-bio.PE"

First- and second-order scattering moments are shown to characterize intermittency and self-similarity properties of multiscale processes. Scattering moments of Poisson processes, fractional Brownian motions, L\'{e}vy processes and multifractal random walks are shown to have characteristic decay.

Convergence of long-memory discrete $k$-th order Volterra processes,"Shuyang Bai, Murad S.

We specify conditions for $X(n)$ to be well-defined in $L^2(\Omega)$, and focus on central and non-central limit theorems. We show that normalized partial sums of centered $X(n)$ obey the central limit theorem if $a(\cdot)$ decays fast enough so that $X(n)$ has short memory. We prove a non-central limit theorem if, on the other hand, $a(\cdot)$ is asymptotically some slowly decaying homogeneous function so that $X(n)$ has long memory. In the non-central case the limit is a linear combination of Hermite-type processes of different orders.

Challenges in nucleosynthesis of trans-iron elements,T. Rauscher,"Nucleosynthesis beyond Fe poses additional challenges not encountered when studying astrophysical processes involving light nuclei. Astrophysical sites and conditions are not well known for some of the processes involved. On the nuclear physics side, different approaches are required, both in theory and experiment. The main differences and most important considerations are presented for a selection of nucleosynthesis processes and reactions, specifically the $s$-, $r$-, $\gamma$-, and $\nu p$-processes. Among the discussed issues are uncertainties in sites and production conditions, the difference between laboratory and stellar rates, reaction mechanisms, important transitions, thermal population of excited states, and uncertainty estimates for stellar rates. The utility and limitations of indirect experimental approaches are also addressed. The presentation should not be viewed as confining the discussed problems to the specific processes. The intention is to generally introduce the concepts and possible pitfalls along with some examples.

For the case of non-summable Levy measures we constructed the quasi-potential operators $B$ and investigated the long time behavior of $X_t$. In the present paper we consider Levy processes $X_t$ with summable Levy measures. In this case the form of the quasi-potential operators $B$ essentially differs from the form in the case of non-summable Levy measures.

The Extended Bloch Representation of Quantum Mechanics and the   Hidden-Measurement Solution to the Measurement Problem,"Diederik Aerts, Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi","A generalized Bloch sphere, in which the states of a quantum entity of arbitrary dimension are geometrically represented, is investigated and further extended, to also incorporate the measurements. This extended representation constitutes a general solution to the measurement problem, inasmuch it allows to derive the Born rule as an average over hidden-variables, describing not the state of the quantum entity, but its interaction with the measuring system. According to this modelization, a quantum measurement is to be understood, in general, as a tripartite process, formed by an initial deterministic decoherence-like process, a subsequent indeterministic collapse-like process, and a final deterministic purification-like process. We also show that quantum probabilities can be generally interpreted as the probabilities of a first-order non-classical theory, describing situations of maximal lack of knowledge regarding the process of actualization of potential interactions, during a measurement.",2014-04-09T10:50:31Z,2015-12-15T08:05:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2429v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2429v3,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"

We show that terminality and non-signalling coincide in any process theory, provided one makes causal structure explicit. In fact, making causal structure explicit is necessary to even make sense of non-signalling in process theories. We conclude that because of its much simpler mathematical form, terminality should be taken to be a more fundamental notion than non-signalling.",2014-05-14T20:52:39Z,2014-12-30T03:00:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3681v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3681v3,"quant-ph, cs.LO, math.CT"

To model such data suitably, we consider symmetric scalar and multivariate $\alpha$-stable linear processes generated by infinite variance innovation sequence. We use a Whittle likelihood type estimating function in the empirical likelihood ratio function and derive the asymptotic distribution of the empirical likelihood ratio statistic for $\alpha$-stable linear processes.

Such networks typically contain many molecular species and reactions and are hard to study analytically as well as by simulation. Particularly, we are interested in reaction networks with intermediate species such as the substrate-enzyme complex in the Michaelis-Menten mechanism. These species are virtually in all real-world networks, they are typically short-lived, degraded at a fast rate and hard to observe experimentally.   We provide conditions under which the Markov process of a multiscale reaction network with intermediate species is approximated in finite dimensional distribution by the Markov process of a simpler reduced reaction network without intermediate species. We do so by embedding the Markov processes into a one-parameter family of processes, where reaction rates and species abundances are scaled in the parameter.

As an example, we extend the exclusive queueing process that can be viewed as a one-dimensional exclusion process with varying length, by introducing Langmuir kinetics. This process can be interpreted as an effective model for a queue that interacts with other queues by allowing incoming and leaving of customers in the bulk.

However, the stationary distribution of the random walk process can only reflect the relative size of node degrees directly, how to infer the real connection is still a problem. In this paper, we will propose a method to reconstruct network by the random walk process, which can reconstruct the total number of links, degree sequence and links sequentially. In our method, only the stationary distribution is used, and no data of the evolution process is needed, such as the first passage time.

We consider different dissipative processes and investigate the real-time evolution from an ordered phase of the Heisenberg or XY-model towards a disordered phase at late times, disregarding unitary Hamiltonian dynamics. The corresponding Kossakowski-Lindblad equation is solved via an efficient cluster algorithm. We find that the symmetry of the dissipative process determines the time scales which govern the approach towards a new equilibrium phase at late times. Most notably, we find a slow equilibration if the dissipative process conserves any of the magnetization Fourier modes.

Following Leyton's ""Generative Theory of Shape"", we represent shapes as sequences of transformation groups composed through a wreath product.   This representation emphasizes the maximization of transfer --- the idea that the most compact and meaningful representation of a given shape is achieved by maximizing the re-use of existing building blocks or parts.   The proposed stochastic wreath process extends Leyton's theory by defining a probability distribution over geometric shapes in terms of noise processes that are aligned with the generative group structure of the shape. We propose an inference scheme for recovering the generative history of given images in terms of the wreath process using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and Approximate Bayesian Computation. In the context of sketching we demonstrate the feasibility and limitations of this approach on model-generated and real data.",2015-06-09T18:56:43Z,2015-06-09T18:56:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03041v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03041v1,"cs.AI, stat.ML, 20-XX"
Self-bias Dependence on Process Parameters in Asymmetric Cylindrical   Coaxial Capacitively Coupled Plasma,"J. Upadhyay, Do Im, S. Popoviƒá, A. -M. Valente-Feliciano, L. Phillips, L. Vu≈°koviƒá","An rf coaxial capacitively coupled Ar/Cl2 plasma is applied to processing the inner wall of superconducting radio frequency cavities. A dc self-bias potential is established across the inner electrode sheath due to the surface area difference between inner and outer electrodes of the coaxial plasma. The self-bias potential measurement is used as an indication of the plasma sheath voltage asymmetry. The understanding of the asymmetry in sheath voltage distribution in coaxial plasma is important for the modification of the inner surfaces of three dimensional objects. The plasma sheath voltages were tailored to process the outer wall by providing an additional dc current to the inner electrode with the help of an external dc power supply. The dc self-bias potential is measured for different diameter electrodes and its variation on process parameters such as gas pressure, rf power and percentage of chlorine in the Ar/Cl2 gas mixture is studied. The dc current needed to overcome the self-bias potential to make it zero is measured for the same process parameters.",2015-06-16T22:47:23Z,2015-06-16T22:47:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05167v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05167v1,"physics.acc-ph, cond-mat.supr-con, physics.plasm-ph"
Least squares estimator for non-ergodic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes   driven by Gaussian processes,"Mohamed El Machkouri, Khalifa Es-Sebaiy, Youssef Ouknine","The statistical analysis for equations driven by fractional Gaussian process (fGp) is relatively recent.

We provide sufficient conditions, based on the properties of $G$, ensuring the strong consistency and the asymptotic distribution of our estimator $\widetilde{\theta}_t$ of $\theta$ based on the observation $\{X_s,\ s\in[0,t]\}$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$. Our approach offers an elementary, unifying proof of \cite{BEO}, and it allows to extend the result of \cite{BEO} to the case when $G$ is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$.

Affine representations of fractional processes with applications in   mathematical finance,"Philipp Harms, David Stefanovits","Fractional processes have gained popularity in financial modeling due to the dependence structure of their increments and the roughness of their sample paths. The non-Markovianity of these processes gives, however, rise to conceptual and practical difficulties in computation and calibration. To address these issues, we show that a certain class of fractional processes can be represented as linear functionals of an infinite dimensional affine process. This can be derived from integral representations similar to those of Carmona, Coutin, Montseny, and Muravlev. We demonstrate by means of several examples that this allows one to construct tractable financial models with fractional features.",2015-10-14T12:26:15Z,2018-02-06T09:23:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04061v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04061v3,"q-fin.MF, math.PR, 60G22 (Primary), 60G15, 60J25, 91G30 (Secondary)"
On global fluctuations for non-colliding processes,Maurice Duits,"We study the global fluctuations for a class of determinantal point processes coming from large systems of non-colliding processes and non-intersecting paths. Our main assumption is that the point processes are constructed by biorthogonal families that satisfy finite term recurrence relations. The central observation of the paper is that the fluctuations of multi-time or multi-layer linear statistics can be efficiently expressed in terms of the associated recurrence matrices. As a consequence, we prove that different models which share the same asymptotic behavior of the recurrence matrices, also share the same asymptotic behavior for the global fluctuations. An important special case is when the recurrence matrices have limits along the diagonals, in which case we prove Central Limit Theorems for the linear statistics. We then show that these results prove Gaussian Free Field fluctuations for the random surfaces associated to these systems. To illustrate the results, several examples will be discussed, including non-colliding processes for which the invariant measures are the classical orthogonal polynomial ensembles and random lozenge tilings of a hexagon.",2015-10-28T10:14:53Z,2015-12-20T18:01:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08248v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08248v2,"math-ph, math.MP, math.PR"
Finitely Dependent Insertion Processes,Avi Levy,"A $q$-coloring of $\mathbb Z$ is a random process assigning one of $q$ colors to each integer in such a way that consecutive integers receive distinct colors. A process is $k$-dependent if any two sets of integers separated by a distance greater than $k$ receive independent colorings. Holroyd and Liggett constructed the first stationary $k$-dependent $q$-colorings by introducing an insertion algorithm on the complete graph $K_q$. We extend their construction from complete graphs to weighted directed graphs. We show that complete multipartite analogues of $K_3$ and $K_4$ are the only graphs whose insertion process is finitely dependent and whose insertion algorithm is consistent. In particular, there are no other such graphs among all unweighted graphs and among all loopless complete weighted directed graphs. Similar results hold if the consistency condition is weakened to eventual consistency. Finally we show that the directed de Bruijn graphs of shifts of finite type do not yield $k$-dependent insertion processes, assuming eventual consistency.",2015-10-30T08:18:00Z,2017-02-03T02:43:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08995v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08995v2,"math.PR, math.CO, 60G10, 05C15, 60C05"
(Quantum) Fractional Brownian Motion and Multifractal Processes under   the Loop of a Tensor Networks,Beno√Æt Descamps,"We derive fractional Brownian motion and stochastic processes with multifractal properties using a framework of network of Gaussian conditional probabilities. This leads to the derivation of new representations of fractional Brownian motion. These constructions are inspired from renormalization. The main result of this paper consists of constructing each increment of the process from two-dimensional gaussian noise inside the light-cone of each seperate increment. Not only does this allows us to derive fractional Brownian motion, we can introduce extensions with multifractal flavour. In another part of this paper, we discuss the use of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), introduced in the study critical systems in quantum spin lattices, as a method for sampling integrals with respect to such multifractal processes. After proper calibration, a MERA promises the generation of a sample of size $N$ of a multifractal process in the order of $O(N\log(N))$, an improvement over the known methods, such as the Cholesky decomposition and the circulant methods, which scale between $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$.",2016-02-02T13:53:18Z,2016-02-02T13:53:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00924v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00924v1,"quant-ph, physics.comp-ph, stat.AP"

In the case where the endpoints agree and the generator of the diffusion process is non-elliptic at that point, the deterministic Malliavin covariance matrix is always degenerate. We identify, after a suitable rescaling, another limiting Malliavin covariance matrix which is non-degenerate, and we show that, with the same scaling, the diffusion Malliavin covariance matrices are uniformly non-degenerate. We further show that the suitably rescaled fluctuations of the diffusion loop converge to a limiting diffusion loop, which is equal in law to the loop we obtain by taking the limiting process of the unconditioned rescaled diffusion processes and condition it to return to its starting point. The generator of the unconditioned limiting rescaled diffusion process can be described in terms of the original generator.",2016-06-01T19:52:22Z,2018-08-27T12:30:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00422v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00422v2,"math.PR, math.DG, 58J65 (Primary) 60H07, 35H10 (Secondary)"
Evolution of the Wasserstein distance between the marginals of two   Markov processes,"Aur√©lien Alfonsi, Jacopo Corbetta, Benjamin Jourdain","In this paper, we are interested in the time derivative of the Wasserstein distance between the marginals of two Markov processes. As recalled in the introduction, the Kantorovich duality leads to a natural candidate for this derivative. Up to the sign, it is the sum of the integrals with respect to each of the two marginals of the corresponding generator applied to the corresponding Kantorovich potential. For pure jump processes with bounded intensity of jumps, we prove that the evolution of the Wasserstein distance is actually given by this candidate. In dimension one, we show that this remains true for Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes.

On dualities for SSEP and ASEP with open boundary conditions,Jun Ohkubo,"Duality relations for simple exclusion processes with general open boundaries are discussed. It is shown that a combination of spin operators and bosonic operators enables us to have an unified discussion for the duality relations with the open boundaries. As for the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP), more general results than previous studies are obtained; it is clarified that not only the absorbing sites, but also additional sites, called copying sites, are needed for the boundaries in the dual process for the SSEP. The role of the copying sites is to conserve information about the particle states on the boundary sites. The similar discussions are applied to the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), in which the q-analogues are employed, and it is clarified that the ASEP with open boundaries has a complicated dual process on the boundaries.",2016-06-17T08:34:06Z,2016-06-17T08:34:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05447v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05447v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.MP"

We provide bounds on the distance between the point process of signal strengths and a Poisson process with the same mean measure, assuming correlated log-normal shadowing.

Financial Applications of Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization,"Joan Gonzalvez, Edmond Lezmi, Thierry Roncalli, Jiali Xu","In the last five years, the financial industry has been impacted by the emergence of digitalization and machine learning. In this article, we explore two methods that have undergone rapid development in recent years: Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization. Gaussian processes can be seen as a generalization of Gaussian random vectors and are associated with the development of kernel methods. Bayesian optimization is an approach for performing derivative-free global optimization in a small dimension, and uses Gaussian processes to locate the global maximum of a black-box function. The first part of the article reviews these two tools and shows how they are connected. In particular, we focus on the Gaussian process regression, which is the core of Bayesian machine learning, and the issue of hyperparameter selection. The second part is dedicated to two financial applications. We first consider the modeling of the term structure of interest rates. More precisely, we test the fitting method and compare the GP prediction and the random walk model.

By designing a subtle strategy to sample two free dimensions from d dimensions, the extended BSP-Tree process can inherit the essential self-consistency property from the original version. Based on the extended BSP-Tree process, an ensemble model, which is named the BSP-Forest, is further developed for regression tasks. Thanks to the retained self-consistency property, we can thus significantly reduce the geometric calculations in the inference stage. Compared to its counterpart, the Mondrian Forest, the BSP-Forest can achieve similar performance with fewer cuts due to its flexibility. The BSP-Forest also outperforms other (Bayesian) regression forests on a number of real-world data sets.",2019-03-22T03:48:48Z,2019-03-22T03:48:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09348v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09348v1,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.PR"
Quantum renewal processes,Bassano Vacchini,"We introduce a general construction of master equations with memory kernel whose solutions are given by completely positive trace preserving maps. These dynamics going beyond the Lindblad paradigm are obtained with reference to classical renewal processes, so that they are termed quantum renewal processes. They can be described by means of semigroup dynamics interrupted by jumps, separated by independently distributed time intervals, following suitable waiting time distributions. In this framework, one can further introduce modified processes, in which the first few events follow different distributions. A crucial role, marking an important difference with respect to the classical case, is played by operator ordering. Indeed, for the same choice of basic quantum transformations, different quantum dynamics arise. In particular, for the case of modified processes, it is natural to consider the time inverted operator ordering, in which the last few events are distributed differently.",2019-06-03T10:40:08Z,2019-06-03T10:40:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00693v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00693v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"
Generalized Expected Discounted Penalty Function at General Drawdown for   L√©vy Risk Processes,"Wenyuan Wang, Ping Chen, Shuanming Li","This paper considers an insurance surplus process modeled by a spectrally negative L\'{e}vy process. Instead of the time of ruin in the traditional setting, we apply the time of drawdown as the risk indicator in this paper. We study the joint distribution of the time of drawdown, the running maximum at drawdown, the last minimum before drawdown, the surplus before drawdown and the surplus at drawdown (may not be deficit in this case), which generalizes the known results on the classical expected discounted penalty function in Gerber and Shiu (1998). The results have semi-explicit expressions in terms of the $q$-scale functions and the L\'{e}vy measure associated with the L\'{e}vy process. As applications, the obtained result is applied to recover results in the literature and to obtain new results for the Gerber-Shiu function at ruin for risk processes embedded with a loss-carry-forward taxation system or a barrier dividend strategy. Moreover, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.",2019-06-03T15:56:49Z,2019-06-03T15:56:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01449v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01449v1,"q-fin.PR, math.PR, 60G51, 91B30, 97M30"
Using anomaly detection to support classification of fast running   (packaging) processes,"Tilman Klaeger, Andre Schult, Lukas Oehm","In this paper we propose a new method to assist in labeling data arriving from fast running processes using anomaly detection. A result is the possibility to manually classify data arriving at a high rates to train machine learning models. To circumvent the problem of not having a real ground truth we propose specific metrics for model selection and validation of the results.   The use case is taken from the food packaging industry, where processes are affected by regular but short breakdowns causing interruptions in the production process. Fast production rates make it hard for machine operators to identify the source and thus the cause of the breakdown. Self learning assistance systems can help them finding the root cause of the problem and assist the machine operator in applying lasting solutions. These learning systems need to be trained to identify reoccurring problems using data analytics. Training is not easy as the process is too fast to be manually monitored to add specific classifications on the single data points.",2019-06-06T08:24:12Z,2020-02-14T17:23:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02473v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02473v2,"cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.ML"
Structured Variational Inference in Continuous Cox Process Models,"Virginia Aglietti, Edwin V. Bonilla, Theodoros Damoulas, Sally Cripps","We propose a scalable framework for inference in an inhomogeneous Poisson process modeled by a continuous sigmoidal Cox process that assumes the corresponding intensity function is given by a Gaussian process (GP) prior transformed with a scaled logistic sigmoid function. We present a tractable representation of the likelihood through augmentation with a superposition of Poisson processes. This view enables a structured variational approximation capturing dependencies across variables in the model. Our framework avoids discretization of the domain, does not require accurate numerical integration over the input space and is not limited to GPs with squared exponential kernels. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real-world data showing that its benefits are particularly pronounced on multivariate input settings where it overcomes the limitations of mean-field methods and sampling schemes.

Transport Triggered Array Processor for Vision Applications,"Mehdi Safarpour, Ilkka Hautala, Miguel Bordallo Lopez, Olli Silven","Low-level sensory data processing in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices pursue energy efficiency by utilizing sleep modes or slowing the clocking to the minimum. To curb the share of stand-by power dissipation in those designs, near-threshold/sub-threshold operational points or ultra-low-leakage processes in fabrication are employed. Those limit the clocking rates significantly, reducing the computing throughputs of individual processing cores. In this contribution we explore compensating for the performance loss of operating in near-threshold region (Vdd =0.6V) through massive parallelization. Benefits of near-threshold operation and massive parallelism are optimum energy consumption per instruction operation and minimized memory roundtrips, respectively. The Processing Elements (PE) of the design are based on Transport Triggered Architecture.

Clustering piecewise stationary processes,"Azadeh Khaleghi, Daniil Ryabko","The problem of time-series clustering is considered in the case where each data-point is a sample generated by a piecewise stationary ergodic process. Stationary processes are perhaps the most general class of processes considered in non-parametric statistics and allow for arbitrary long-range dependence between variables. Piecewise stationary processes studied here for the first time in the context of clustering, relax the last remaining assumption in this model: stationarity. A natural formulation is proposed for this problem and a notion of consistency is introduced which requires the samples to be placed in the same cluster if and only if the piecewise stationary distributions that generate them have the same set of stationary distributions. Simple, computationally efficient algorithms are proposed and are shown to be consistent without any additional assumptions beyond piecewise stationarity.",2019-06-26T09:01:29Z,2019-06-26T09:01:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10921v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10921v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH"

To overcome the lack of radar labeled data, we rely in training only on the radar calibration data and introduce new radar augmentation techniques. We evaluate our method on the radar 4D detection task and demonstrate superior performance compared to the classical approaches while keeping real-time performance. Applying deep learning on radar data has several advantages such as eliminating the need for an expensive radar calibration process each time and enabling classification of the detected objects with almost zero-overhead.",2019-06-26T13:30:45Z,2019-06-26T13:30:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12187v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.12187v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP, stat.ML"

Mixing time and cutoff phenomenon for the interchange process on   dumbbell graphs and the labelled exclusion process on the complete graph,"Rich√°rd Patk√≥, G√°bor Pete","We find the total variation mixing time of the interchange process on the dumbbell graph (two complete graphs, $K_n$ and $K_m$, connected by a single edge), and show that this sequence of chains exhibits the cutoff phenomenon precisely when the smaller size $m$ goes to infinity. The mixing time undergoes a phase transition at $m\asymp \sqrt{n}$. We also state a conjecture on when exactly cutoff holds for the interchange process on general graphs.   Our proofs use coupling methods, and they also give the mixing time of the simple exclusion process of $k$ labelled particles in the complete graph $K_n$, for any $k\leq n$, with cutoff, as conjectured by Lacoin and Leblond (2011).

Infinitely Stochastic Micro Forecasting,"Mat√∫≈° Maciak, Ostap Okhrin, Michal Pe≈°ta","Forecasting costs is now a front burner in empirical economics. We propose an unconventional tool for stochastic prediction of future expenses based on the individual (micro) developments of recorded events. Consider a firm, enterprise, institution, or state, which possesses knowledge about particular historical events. For each event, there is a series of several related subevents: payments or losses spread over time, which all leads to an infinitely stochastic process at the end. Nevertheless, the issue is that some already occurred events do not have to be necessarily reported. The aim lies in forecasting future subevent flows coming from already reported, occurred but not reported, and yet not occurred events. Our methodology is illustrated on quantitative risk assessment, however, it can be applied to other areas such as startups, epidemics, war damages, advertising and commercials, digital payments, or drug prescription as manifested in the paper. As a theoretical contribution, inference for infinitely stochastic processes is developed. In particular, a non-homogeneous Poisson process with non-homogeneous Poisson processes as marks is used, which includes for instance the Cox process as a special case.",2019-08-28T10:54:18Z,2019-09-19T08:35:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10636v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10636v2,"econ.EM, stat.AP, 62F12, 62M20, 60G55, 62P05, 97M30"

This refutes a conjecture of M. Smorodinsky [11], which was first suggested by D. Rudolph [7]. We further show that any ergodic system is isomorphic to a process none of whose finitary factors are i.i.d. processes, and in particular, there is no general finitary Sinai's factor theorem for ergodic processes.

If an action can be separated into subactions, the reaction time of the systems can be improved through incremental processing of the user utterance and starting subactions while the utterance is still being uttered. In this work, we present a model-agnostic method to achieve high quality in processing incrementally produced partial utterances.

We then apply the general theorem to two different settings: the estimation of a density using Dirichlet process mixtures of Gaussian random variables with base measure depending on some empirical quantities and the estimation of the intensity of a counting process under the Aalen model. A simulation study for inhomogeneous Poisson processes also illustrates our results. In the former case we also derive some results on the estimation of the mixing density and on the deconvolution problem.

Approximations for the Moments of Nonstationary and State Dependent   Birth-Death Queues,"Stefan Engblom, Jamol Pender","In this paper we propose a new method for approximating the nonstationary moment dynamics of one dimensional Markovian birth-death processes. By expanding the transition probabilities of the Markov process in terms of Poisson-Charlier polynomials, we are able to estimate any moment of the Markov process even though the system of moment equations may not be closed. Using new weighted discrete Sobolev spaces, we derive explicit error bounds of the transition probabilities and new weak a priori estimates for approximating the moments of the Markov processs using a truncated form of the expansion. Using our error bounds and estimates, we are able to show that our approximations converge to the true stochastic process as we add more terms to the expansion and give explicit bounds on the truncation error. As a result, we are the first paper in the queueing literature to provide error bounds and estimates on the performance of a moment closure approximation. Lastly, we perform several numerical experiments for some important models in the queueing theory literature and show that our expansion techniques are accurate at estimating the moment dynamics of these Markov process with only a few terms of the expansion.",2014-06-24T08:07:40Z,2014-09-22T06:40:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6164v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6164v2,"math.NA, cs.NA, math.DS, math.PR"

Topographic Representation for Quantum Machine Learning,Bruce MacLennan,"This paper proposes a brain-inspired approach to quantum machine learning with the goal of circumventing many of the complications of other approaches. The fact that quantum processes are unitary presents both opportunities and challenges. A principal opportunity is that a large number of computations can be carried out in parallel in linear superposition, that is, quantum parallelism. The challenge is that the process is linear, and most approaches to machine learning depend significantly on nonlinear processes. Fortunately, the situation is not hopeless, for we know that nonlinear processes can be embedded in unitary processes, as is familiar from the circuit model of quantum computation. This paper explores an approach to the quantum implementation of machine learning involving nonlinear functions operating on information represented topographically (by computational maps), as common in neural cortex.",2018-10-13T01:54:08Z,2019-05-15T01:13:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06992v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06992v3,"cs.LG, quant-ph, stat.ML, 81P68, B.2; I.2"

In contrast, probabilistic kernel methods like Gaussian Processes offer uncertainty estimates in addition to good predictive performance but fall short in terms of scalability. While the scalability of Gaussian processes can be improved using sparse inducing point approximations, the selection of these inducing points remains challenging. We explore different techniques for selecting inducing points on discrete domains, including greedy selection, determinantal point processes, and simulated annealing.

As a result, source separation GP models have been restricted to the analysis of short audio frames. We introduce an efficient application of GPs to time-domain audio source separation, without compromising performance.

"A Greedy Approach to $\ell_{0,\infty}$ Based Convolutional Sparse Coding","Elad Plaut, Raja Giryes","Sparse coding techniques for image processing traditionally rely on a processing of small overlapping patches separately followed by averaging. This has the disadvantage that the reconstructed image no longer obeys the sparsity prior used in the processing. For this purpose convolutional sparse coding has been introduced, where a shift-invariant dictionary is used and the sparsity of the recovered image is maintained. Most such strategies target the $\ell_0$ ""norm"" or the $\ell_1$ norm of the whole image, which may create an imbalanced sparsity across various regions in the image. In order to face this challenge, the $\ell_{0,\infty}$ ""norm"" has been proposed as an alternative that ""operates locally while thinking globally"". The approaches taken for tackling the non-convexity of these optimization problems have been either using a convex relaxation or local pursuit algorithms. In this paper, we present an efficient greedy method for sparse coding and dictionary learning, which is specifically tailored to $\ell_{0,\infty}$, and is based on matching pursuit.

Algorithms are also developed for the cases when the post-change distribution is not known or when there are multiple streams of observations. The modeling is inspired by real datasets encountered in cyber-physical systems, biology, and medicine.

Audio-noise Power Spectral Density Estimation Using Long Short-term   Memory,"Xiaofei Li, Simon Leglaive, Laurent Girin, Radu Horaud","We propose a method using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to estimate the noise power spectral density (PSD) of single-channel audio signals represented in the short time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. An LSTM network common to all frequency bands is trained, which processes each frequency band individually by mapping the noisy STFT magnitude sequence to its corresponding noise PSD sequence. Unlike deep-learning-based speech enhancement methods that learn the full-band spectral structure of speech segments, the proposed method exploits the sub-band STFT magnitude evolution of noise with a long time dependency, in the spirit of the unsupervised noise estimators described in the literature. Speaker- and speech-independent experiments with different types of noise show that the proposed method outperforms the unsupervised estimators, and generalizes well to noise types that are not present in the training set.",2019-04-10T13:14:11Z,2019-04-10T13:14:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05166v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05166v1,"eess.SP, cs.SD, eess.AS"
Read classification using semi-supervised deep learning,"Tomislav ≈†ebrek, Jan Tomljanoviƒá, Josip Krapac, Mile ≈†ikiƒá","In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning method for detecting the specific types of reads that impede the de novo genome assembly process. Instead of dealing directly with sequenced reads, we analyze their coverage graphs converted to 1D-signals. We noticed that specific signal patterns occur in each relevant class of reads. Semi-supervised approach is chosen because manually labelling the data is a very slow and tedious process, so our goal was to facilitate the assembly process with as little labeled data as possible. We tested two models to learn patterns in the coverage graphs: M1+M2 and semi-GAN. We evaluated the performance of each model based on a manually labeled dataset that comprises various reads from multiple reference genomes with respect to the number of labeled examples that were used during the training process. In addition, we embedded our detection in the assembly process which improved the quality of assemblies.",2019-04-23T14:25:42Z,2019-04-23T14:25:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10353v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10353v1,"cs.LG, q-bio.GN, stat.ML"
Age of Information for Updates with Distortion,"Melih Bastopcu, Sennur Ulukus","We consider an information update system where an information receiver requests updates from an information provider in order to minimize its age of information. The updates are generated at the transmitter as a result of completing a set of tasks such as collecting data and performing computations. We refer to this as the update generation process. We model the $quality$ (i.e., $distortion$) of an update as an increasing (resp. decreasing) function of the processing time spent while generating the update at the transmitter. While processing longer at the transmitter results in a better quality (lower distortion) update, it causes the update to age. We determine the age-optimal policies for the update request times at the receiver and update processing times at the transmitter subject to a minimum required quality (maximum allowed distortion) constraint on the updates.",2019-04-23T17:50:10Z,2019-12-25T19:48:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10444v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10444v3,"cs.IT, cs.NI, eess.SP, math.IT"
Chunkflow: Distributed Hybrid Cloud Processing of Large 3D Images by   Convolutional Nets,"Jingpeng Wu, William M. Silversmith, Kisuk Lee, H. Sebastian Seung","It is now common to process volumetric biomedical images using 3D Convolutional Networks (ConvNets). This can be challenging for the teravoxel and even petavoxel images that are being acquired today by light or electron microscopy. Here we introduce chunkflow, a software framework for distributing ConvNet processing over local and cloud GPUs and CPUs. The image volume is divided into overlapping chunks, each chunk is processed by a ConvNet, and the results are blended together to yield the output image. The frontend submits ConvNet tasks to a cloud queue. The tasks are executed by local and cloud GPUs and CPUs. Thanks to the fault-tolerant architecture of Chunkflow, cost can be greatly reduced by utilizing cheap unstable cloud instances. Chunkflow currently supports PyTorch for GPUs and PZnet for CPUs. To illustrate its usage, a large 3D brain image from serial section electron microscopy was processed by a 3D ConvNet with a U-Net style architecture. Chunkflow provides some chunk operations for general use, and the operations can be composed flexibly in a command line interface.",2019-04-23T18:47:57Z,2019-05-02T13:48:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10489v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10489v3,"cs.DC, cs.CV, q-bio.NC"
Pulse strategy for suppressing spreading on networks,"Qiang Liu, Xiaoyu Zhou, Piet Van Mieghem","In networked spreading models, each node can infect its neighbors and cure spontaneously. The curing is assumed to occur uniformly over time. A pulse immunization/curing strategy is more efficient and broadly applied to suppressing spreading processes. We model the epidemic process by the basic Susceptible-Infected (SI) process with a pulse curing and incorporate the underlying contact network. The mean-field epidemic threshold of the pulse SI model is shown to be $\frac{1}{\lambda_1}\ln\frac{1}{1-p}$, where $\lambda_1$ and $p$ are the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the fraction of nodes covered by each curing, respectively. Compared to the extensively studied uniform curing process, we show that the pulse curing strategy saves about $36.8$\%, i.e. $p\approx 0.632$, of the number of curing operations invariant to the network structure. Our results may help related policy makers to estimate the cost of controlling spreading processes.",2019-04-24T15:53:00Z,2019-04-24T15:53:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10883v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10883v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.CR, cs.SI"

For this purpose, we prove an almost sure approximation of the empirical U-process by a Gaussian process. With the help of a generalized Bahadur representation, it follows that such a strong invariance principle also holds for the empirical U-quantile process and consequently for GL-statistics.

Entropy Rates of the Multidimensional Moran Processes and   Generalizations,Marc Harper,"The interrelationships of the fundamental biological processes natural selection, mutation, and stochastic drift are quantified by the entropy rate of Moran processes with mutation, measuring the long-run variation of a Markov process. The entropy rate is shown to behave intuitively with respect to evolutionary parameters such as monotonicity with respect to mutation probability (for the neutral landscape), relative fitness, and strength of selection. Strict upper bounds, depending only on the number of replicating types, for the entropy rate are given and the neutral fitness landscape attains the maximum in the large population limit. Various additional limits are computed including small mutation, weak and strong selection, and large population holding the other parameters constant, revealing the individual contributions and dependences of each evolutionary parameter on the long-run outcomes of the processes.",2014-01-13T05:15:51Z,2014-01-13T05:15:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2713v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.2713v1,"math.DS, cs.IT, math.IT, q-bio.PE"

We also show that a covariance kernel of a particular parametric form is necessary and sufficient for a solution to possess stationary increments and for a Gaussian process, in considerable generality, to have stationary increments and the Markov property. For a discretely sampled Gaussian process with such a parametric kernel, we derive closed-form expressions for unique maximum likelihood estimators of the parameter matrices that are unbiased, jointly sufficient, and easily computed regardless of the dimension.

We identify two linked problems related to estimating the phase of the alpha rhythm when the signal after a specific event is unknown (real-time case), or corrupted (offline analysis).

We abundantly illustrate our approach by analyzing Gaussian and non-Gaussian self-similar signals, as well as multi-fractal signals. Using Gaussian signals allow us to check that our approach is robust in the sense that all quantities behave as expected from analytical derivations.

The population with large values and the trajectorial behavior of $Z_n[a_n,\infty)$ is obtained from the ancestral paths associated to the large deviations of $Y$ together with its environment. The study of large deviations of autoregressive processes in random environment is of independent interest and achieved first in this paper. The proofs of trajectorial estimates for bifurcating autoregressive process involves then a law of large numbers for non-homogenous trees.   Two regimes appear in the stable case, depending on the fact that one of the autoregressive parameter is greater than one or not.

The first component is taken as the approximation and is much simpler than simulation of general Gaussian processes, while the latter two components are analyzed as the error. We derive technical conditions for the two error terms to vanish in the limit and for the scaled component on small jumps to converge to a Gaussian process so as to enhance the accuracy of the weak approximation. We provide an extensive collection of examples to highlight the wide practicality of the proposed approach.",2021-03-02T01:59:36Z,2021-03-02T01:59:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01414v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01414v1,"math.PR, cs.NA, math.NA, 60E07, 60G52, 60G51, 60F05, 65C05"
Using Meta-learning to Recommend Process Discovery Methods,"Sylvio Barbon Jr, Paolo Ceravolo, Ernesto Damiani, Gabriel Marques Tavares","Process discovery methods have obtained remarkable achievements in Process Mining, delivering comprehensible process models to enhance management capabilities. However, selecting the suitable method for a specific event log highly relies on human expertise, hindering its broad application. Solutions based on Meta-learning (MtL) have been promising for creating systems with reduced human assistance. This paper presents a MtL solution for recommending process discovery methods that maximize model quality according to complementary dimensions. Thanks to our MtL pipeline, it was possible to recommend a discovery method with 92% of accuracy using light-weight features that describe the event log. Our experimental analysis also provided significant insights on the importance of log features in generating recommendations, paving the way to a deeper understanding of the discovery algorithms.",2021-03-23T22:40:21Z,2021-03-23T22:40:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12874v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12874v1,"cs.LG, cs.IR, cs.SE"
Node metadata can produce predictability transitions in network   inference problems,"Oscar Fajardo-Fontiveros, Marta Sales-Pardo, Roger Guimera","Network inference is the process of learning the properties of complex networks from data. Besides using information about known links in the network, node attributes and other forms of network metadata can help to solve network inference problems. Indeed, several approaches have been proposed to introduce metadata into probabilistic network models and to use them to make better inferences. However, we know little about the effect of such metadata in the inference process. Here, we investigate this issue. We find that, rather than affecting inference gradually, adding metadata causes abrupt transitions in the inference process and in our ability to make accurate predictions, from a situation in which metadata does not play any role to a situation in which metadata completely dominates the inference process. When network data and metadata are partly correlated, metadata optimally contributes to the inference process at the transition between data-dominated and metadata-dominated regimes.",2021-03-26T12:08:07Z,2021-03-26T12:08:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14424v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14424v1,"physics.data-an, cs.LG, cs.SI, physics.soc-ph, stat.ML"
Oscillatory matrix model in Chern-Simons theory and Jacobi-theta   determinantal point process,"Yuta Takahashi, Makoto Katori","The partition function of the Chern-Simons theory on the three-sphere with the unitary group $U(N)$ provides a one-matrix model. The corresponding $N$-particle system can be mapped to the determinantal point process whose correlation kernel is expressed by using the Stieltjes-Wigert orthogonal polynomials. The matrix model and the point process are regarded as $q$-extensions of the random matrix model in the Gaussian unitary ensemble and its eigenvalue point process, respectively. We prove the convergence of the $N$-particle system to an infinite-dimensional determinantal point process in $N \to \infty$, in which the correlation kernel is expressed by Jacobi's theta functions. We show that the matrix model obtained by this limit realizes the oscillatory matrix model in Chern-Simons theory discussed by de Haro and Tierz.",2013-12-20T08:35:17Z,2014-08-16T13:21:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5848v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5848v2,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, math.MP, math.PR, nlin.SI"
Quasistatic dynamical systems,"Neil Dobbs, Mikko Stenlund","We introduce the notion of a quasistatic dynamical system, which generalizes that of an ordinary dynamical system. Quasistatic dynamical systems are inspired by the namesake processes in thermodynamics, which are idealized processes where the observed system transforms (infinitesimally) slowly due to external influence, tracing out a continuous path of thermodynamic equilibria over an (infinitely) long time span. Time-evolution of states under a quasistatic dynamical system is entirely deterministic, but choosing the initial state randomly renders the process a stochastic one. In the prototypical setting where the time-evolution is specified by strongly chaotic maps on the circle, we obtain a description of the statistical behaviour as a stochastic diffusion process, under surprisingly mild conditions on the initial distribution, by solving a well-posed martingale problem. We also consider various admissible ways of centering the process, with the curious conclusion that the ""obvious"" centering suggested by the initial distribution sometimes fails to yield the expected diffusion.",2015-04-08T11:51:01Z,2015-04-08T11:51:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01926v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01926v1,"math.DS, math-ph, math.MP, math.PR, 37C60, 60G44, 60H10"
Nonparametric Nearest Neighbor Random Process Clustering,"Michael Tschannen, Helmut B√∂lcskei","We consider the problem of clustering noisy finite-length observations of stationary ergodic random processes according to their nonparametric generative models without prior knowledge of the model statistics and the number of generative models. Two algorithms, both using the L1-distance between estimated power spectral densities (PSDs) as a measure of dissimilarity, are analyzed. The first algorithm, termed nearest neighbor process clustering (NNPC), to the best of our knowledge, is new and relies on partitioning the nearest neighbor graph of the observations via spectral clustering. The second algorithm, simply referred to as k-means (KM), consists of a single k-means iteration with farthest point initialization and was considered before in the literature, albeit with a different measure of dissimilarity and with asymptotic performance results only. We show that both NNPC and KM succeed with high probability under noise and even when the generative process PSDs overlap significantly, all provided that the observation length is sufficiently large. Our results quantify the tradeoff between the overlap of the generative process PSDs, the noise variance, and the observation length. Finally, we present numerical performance results for synthetic and real data.",2015-04-20T13:48:45Z,2015-04-20T13:48:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05059v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.05059v1,"stat.ML, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT"
Stability of Stochastic Approximations with `Controlled Markov' Noise   and Temporal Difference Learning,"Arunselvan Ramaswamy, Shalabh Bhatnagar","We are interested in understanding stability (almost sure boundedness) of stochastic approximation algorithms (SAs) driven by a `controlled Markov' process. Analyzing this class of algorithms is important, since many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be cast as SAs driven by a `controlled Markov' process. In this paper, we present easily verifiable sufficient conditions for stability and convergence of SAs driven by a `controlled Markov' process. Many RL applications involve continuous state spaces. While our analysis readily ensures stability for such continuous state applications, traditional analyses do not. As compared to literature, our analysis presents a two-fold generalization (a) the Markov process may evolve in a continuous state space and (b) the process need not be ergodic under any given stationary policy. Temporal difference learning (TD) is an important policy evaluation method in reinforcement learning. The theory developed herein, is used to analyze generalized $TD(0)$, an important variant of TD.

Asymptotic Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Point Processes Based on Scaled   Empirical K-Functions,Lothar Heinrich,We study sequences of scaled edge-corrected empirical (generalized) K-functions (modifying Ripley's K-function) each of them constructed from a single observation of a $d$-dimensional fourth-order stationary point process in a sampling window W_n which grows together with some scaling rate unboundedly as n --> infty. Under some natural assumptions it is shown that the normalized difference between scaled empirical and scaled theoretical K-function converges weakly to a mean zero Gaussian process with simple covariance function. This result suggests discrepancy measures between empirical and theoretical K-function with known limit distribution which allow to perform goodness-of-fit tests for checking a hypothesized point process based only on its intensity and (generalized) K-function. Similar test statistics are derived for testing the hypothesis that two independent point processes in W_n have the same distribution without explicit knowledge of their intensities and K-functions.,2017-06-04T13:44:55Z,2017-06-04T13:44:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01074v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01074v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, Primary: 62 G 10, 60 G 55, Secondary: 60 F 05, 60 F 17"
Mathematical Models of Gene Expression,Philippe Robert,"In this paper we analyze the equilibrium properties of a large class of stochastic processes describing the fundamental biological process within bacterial cells, {\em the production process of proteins}. Stochastic models classically used in this context to describe the time evolution of the numbers of mRNAs and proteins are presented and discussed. An extension of these models, which includes elongation phases of mRNAs and proteins, is introduced. A convergence result to equilibrium for the process associated to the number of proteins and mRNAs is proved and a representation of this equilibrium as a functional of a Poisson process in an extended state space is obtained. Explicit expressions for the first two moments of the number of mRNAs and proteins at equilibrium are derived, generalizing some classical formulas. Approximations used in the biological literature for the equilibrium distribution of the number of proteins are discussed and investigated in the light of these results.

A unified construction for series representations and finite   approximations of completely random measures,"Juho Lee, Xenia Miscouridou, Fran√ßois Caron","Infinite-activity completely random measures (CRMs) have become important building blocks of complex Bayesian nonparametric models. They have been successfully used in various applications such as clustering, density estimation, latent feature models, survival analysis or network science. Popular infinite-activity CRMs include the (generalized) gamma process and the (stable) beta process. However, except in some specific cases, exact simulation or scalable inference with these models is challenging and finite-dimensional approximations are often considered. In this work, we propose a general and unified framework to derive both series representations and finite-dimensional approximations of CRMs. Our framework can be seen as an extension of constructions based on size-biased sampling of Poisson point process [Perman1992]. It includes as special cases several known series representations as well as novel ones. In particular, we show that one can get novel series representations for the generalized gamma process and the stable beta process.

Fast and Accurate Amplitude Demodulation of Wideband Signals,Mantas Gabrielaitis,"Amplitude demodulation is a classical operation used in signal processing. For a long time, its effective applications in practice have been limited to narrowband signals. In this work, we generalize amplitude demodulation to wideband signals. We pose demodulation as a recovery problem of an oversampled corrupted signal and introduce special iterative schemes belonging to the family of alternating projection algorithms to solve it. Sensibly chosen structural assumptions on the demodulation outputs allow us to reveal the high inferential accuracy of the method over a rich set of relevant signals. This new approach surpasses current state-of-the-art demodulation techniques apt to wideband signals in computational efficiency by up to many orders of magnitude with no sacrifice in quality. Such performance opens the door for applications of the amplitude demodulation procedure in new contexts. In particular, the new method makes online and large-scale offline data processing feasible, including the calculation of modulator-carrier pairs in higher dimensions and poor sampling conditions, independent of the signal bandwidth. We illustrate the utility and specifics of applications of the new method in practice by using natural speech and synthetic signals.",2021-02-09T14:06:29Z,2021-06-07T17:07:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04832v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04832v2,"eess.SP, cs.SD, eess.AS"
"Divergent Predictive States: The Statistical Complexity Dimension of   Stationary, Ergodic Hidden Markov Processes","Alexandra M. Jurgens, James P. Crutchfield","Even simply-defined, finite-state generators produce stochastic processes that require tracking an uncountable infinity of probabilistic features for optimal prediction. For processes generated by hidden Markov chains the consequences are dramatic. Their predictive models are generically infinite-state. And, until recently, one could determine neither their intrinsic randomness nor structural complexity. The prequel, though, introduced methods to accurately calculate the Shannon entropy rate (randomness) and to constructively determine their minimal (though, infinite) set of predictive features. Leveraging this, we address the complementary challenge of determining how structured hidden Markov processes are by calculating their statistical complexity dimension -- the information dimension of the minimal set of predictive features. This tracks the divergence rate of the minimal memory resources required to optimally predict a broad class of truly complex processes.",2021-02-21T00:58:09Z,2021-03-15T20:23:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10487v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10487v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.IT, math.DS, math.IT, nlin.CD"

We prove that this process is equivalent with the time shift $t \to t+\sigma^2$ of the noncolliding BM starting from the configuration in which all $N$ particles are put at the origin. In order to demonstrate nontriviality of such equivalence for determinantal processes, we show that, even from its special consequence, determinantal expressions are derived for the ensemble averages of products of characteristic polynomials of random matrices in GUE.

This paper considers the irreversible k-threshold and majority conversion processes. In an irreversible k-threshold (resp., majority) conversion process, a vertex is permanently colored black in a certain time period if at least k (resp., at least half) of its neighbors were black in the previous time period. A k-conversion set (resp., dynamic monopoly) is a set of vertices which, if initially colored black, will result in all vertices eventually being colored black under a k-threshold (resp., majority) conversion process.

Open Markov processes: A compositional perspective on non-equilibrium   steady states in biology,Blake S. Pollard,"In recent work, Baez, Fong and the author introduced a framework for describing Markov processes equipped with a detailed balanced equilibrium as open systems of a certain type. These `open Markov processes' serve as the building blocks for more complicated processes. In this paper, we describe the potential application of this framework in the modeling of biological systems as open systems maintained away from equilibrium. We show that non-equilibrium steady states emerge in open systems of this type, even when the rates of the underlying process are such that a detailed balanced equilibrium is permitted. It is shown that these non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call `dissipation.' In some circumstances, the dissipation is approximately equal to the rate of change of relative entropy plus a correction term. On the other hand, Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production generally fails for non-equilibrium steady states. We use a simple model of membrane transport to illustrate these concepts.",2016-01-05T01:22:11Z,2016-01-05T01:22:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00711v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00711v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft, math.CT"

This enables to catch some empirical facts on the behavior of financial markets: when the bridge process is away from zero, investors can be relatively sure that the default will not happen immediately. However, when the information process is close to zero, market agents should be aware of the risk of an imminent default. In this sense the bridge process leaks information concerning the default before it occurs.

We consider the multidimensional Poisson process or the multivariate renewal process. This class of processes can be used as a description of the distributed detection system. The multivariate renewal process can be seen as the sequence of random vectors, where parts of its coordinates are holding times, others are the size of jumps and the index of stream, at which the new event appears. It is assumed that at each stream two kinds of changes are possible: in the holding time or in the size of jumps distribution. The various specific mutual relations between the change points are possible. The aim of the research is to derive the detectors which realize the optimal value of the specified criterion. The change point moment estimates have been obtained in some cases. The difficulties have appeared for the dependent streams with unspecified order of change points. The presented results suggest further research on the construction of detectors in the general model.",2020-02-02T12:43:24Z,2020-02-02T12:43:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00384v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00384v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, Primary: 93E10, 62L15, Secondary: 93E03, 60G40"
Semiparametric Bayesian Forecasting of Spatial Earthquake Occurrences,"Aleksandar A. Kolev, Gordon J. Ross","Self-exciting Hawkes processes are used to model events which cluster in time and space, and have been widely studied in seismology under the name of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. In the ETAS framework, the occurrence of the mainshock earthquakes in a geographical region is assumed to follow an inhomogeneous spatial point process, and aftershock events are then modelled via a separate triggering kernel. Most previous studies of the ETAS model have relied on point estimates of the model parameters due to the complexity of the likelihood function, and the difficulty in estimating an appropriate mainshock distribution. In order to take estimation uncertainty into account, we instead propose a fully Bayesian formulation of the ETAS model which uses a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture prior to capture the spatial mainshock process. Direct inference for the resulting model is problematic due to the strong correlation of the parameters for the mainshock and triggering processes, so we instead use an auxiliary latent variable routine to perform efficient inference.",2020-02-05T10:11:26Z,2020-02-05T10:11:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01706v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01706v1,"stat.CO, stat.AP, stat.ML"

Afterwards, we will apply our results to several examples of bivariate orthogonal polynomials, namely product orthogonal polynomials, orthogonal polynomials on a parabolic domain and orthogonal polynomials on the triangle.

Gaussian process imputation of multiple financial series,"Taco de Wolff, Alejandro Cuevas, Felipe Tobar","In Financial Signal Processing, multiple time series such as financial indicators, stock prices and exchange rates are strongly coupled due to their dependence on the latent state of the market and therefore they are required to be jointly analysed. We focus on learning the relationships among financial time series by modelling them through a multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) with expressive covariance functions. Learning these market dependencies among financial series is crucial for the imputation and prediction of financial observations. The proposed model is validated experimentally on two real-world financial datasets for which their correlations across channels are analysed.

A Put-Call Transformation of the Exchange Option Problem under   Stochastic Volatility and Jump Diffusion Dynamics,"Len Patrick Dominic M. Garces, Gerald H. L. Cheang","We price European and American exchange options where the underlying asset prices are modelled using a Merton (1976) jump-diffusion with a common Heston (1993) stochastic volatility process. Pricing is performed under an equivalent martingale measure obtained by setting the second asset yield process as the numeraire asset, as suggested by Bjerskund and Stensland (1993). Such a choice for the numeraire reduces the exchange option pricing problem, a two-dimensional problem, to pricing a call option written on the ratio of the yield processes of the two assets, a one-dimensional problem. The joint transition density function of the asset yield ratio process and the instantaneous variance process is then determined from the corresponding Kolmogorov backward equation via integral transforms. We then determine integral representations for the European exchange option price and the early exercise premium and state a linked system of integral equations that characterizes the American exchange option price and the associated early exercise boundary. Properties of the early exercise boundary near maturity are also discussed.",2020-02-24T12:21:26Z,2020-02-24T12:21:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10194v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10194v1,"q-fin.MF, q-fin.PR, 91G30"
Learning Multivariate Hawkes Processes at Scale,"Maximilian Nickel, Matthew Le","Multivariate Hawkes Processes (MHPs) are an important class of temporal point processes that have enabled key advances in understanding and predicting social information systems. However, due to their complex modeling of temporal dependencies, MHPs have proven to be notoriously difficult to scale, what has limited their applications to relatively small domains. In this work, we propose a novel model and computational approach to overcome this important limitation. By exploiting a characteristic sparsity pattern in real-world diffusion processes, we show that our approach allows to compute the exact likelihood and gradients of an MHP -- independently of the ambient dimensions of the underlying network. We show on synthetic and real-world datasets that our model does not only achieve state-of-the-art predictive results, but also improves runtime performance by multiple orders of magnitude compared to standard methods on sparse event sequences. In combination with easily interpretable latent variables and influence structures, this allows us to analyze diffusion processes at previously unattainable scale.",2020-02-28T01:18:01Z,2020-02-28T01:18:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12501v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12501v1,"cs.LG, cs.SI, stat.ML"
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): Another Perspective for Unsupervised   Wireless Localization,"You Li, Xin Hu, Yuan Zhuang, Zhouzheng Gao, Peng Zhang, Naser El-Sheimy","Location is key to spatialize internet-of-things (IoT) data. However, it is challenging to use low-cost IoT devices for robust unsupervised localization (i.e., localization without training data that have known location labels). Thus, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based unsupervised wireless-localization method. The main contributions are as follows. (1) This paper proposes an approach to model a continuous wireless-localization process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and process it within a DRL framework. (2) To alleviate the challenge of obtaining rewards when using unlabeled data (e.g., daily-life crowdsourced data), this paper presents a reward-setting mechanism, which extracts robust landmark data from unlabeled wireless received signal strengths (RSS). (3) To ease requirements for model re-training when using DRL for localization, this paper uses RSS measurements together with agent location to construct DRL inputs. The proposed method was tested by using field testing data from multiple Bluetooth 5 smart ear tags in a pasture. Meanwhile, the experimental verification process reflected the advantages and challenges for using DRL in wireless localization.",2020-04-09T16:03:56Z,2020-04-09T16:03:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04618v1,"cs.LG, eess.SP, stat.ML"
Size and shape of tracked Brownian bridges,"Abdulrahman Alsolami, James Burridge, Michal Gnacik","We investigate the typical sizes and shapes of sets of points obtained by irregularly tracking two-dimensional Brownian bridges. The tracking process consists of observing the path location at the arrival times of a non-homogeneous Poisson process on a finite time interval. The time varying intensity of this observation process is the tracking strategy. By analysing the gyration tensor of tracked points we prove two theorems which relate the tracking strategy to the average gyration radius, and to the asphericity -- a measure of how non-spherical the point set is. The act of tracking may be interpreted either as a process of observation, or as process of depositing time decaying ""evidence"" such as scent, environmental disturbance, or disease particles. We present examples of different strategies, and explore by simulation the effects of varying the total number of tracking points.",2020-04-11T13:05:03Z,2020-04-11T13:05:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05394v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05394v1,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.data-an, 76F55, 60K35, 60J65, 60J70"
Neural Speech Separation Using Spatially Distributed Microphones,"Dongmei Wang, Zhuo Chen, Takuya Yoshioka","This paper proposes a neural network based speech separation method using spatially distributed microphones. Unlike with traditional microphone array settings, neither the number of microphones nor their spatial arrangement is known in advance, which hinders the use of conventional multi-channel speech separation neural networks based on fixed size input. To overcome this, a novel network architecture is proposed that interleaves inter-channel processing layers and temporal processing layers. The inter-channel processing layers apply a self-attention mechanism along the channel dimension to exploit the information obtained with a varying number of microphones. The temporal processing layers are based on a bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) model and applied to each channel independently. The proposed network leverages information across time and space by stacking these two kinds of layers alternately. Our network estimates time-frequency (TF) masks for each speaker, which are then used to generate enhanced speech signals either with TF masking or beamforming. Speech recognition experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline multi-channel speech separation systems.",2020-04-28T17:16:31Z,2020-04-28T17:16:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13670v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13670v1,"eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.SD"

The estimators are computed as localized M-estimators of any contrast satisfying appropriate contraction conditions. We prove the uniform consistency and pointwise asymptotic normality of such kernel based estimators. We apply our result to usual contrasts such as least-square, least absolute value, or quasi-maximum likelihood contrasts.

Correlated Mixed Membership Modeling of Somatic Mutations,"Rahul Mehta, Muge Karaman","Recent studies of cancer somatic mutation profiles seek to identify mutations for targeted therapy in personalized medicine. Analysis of profiles, however, is not trivial, as each profile is heterogeneous and there are multiple confounding factors that influence the cause-and-effect relationships between cancer genes such as cancer (sub)type, biological processes, total number of mutations, and non-linear mutation interactions. Moreover, cancer is biologically redundant, i.e., distinct mutations can result in the alteration of similar biological processes, so it is important to identify all possible combinatorial sets of mutations for effective patient treatment. To model this phenomena, we propose the correlated zero-inflated negative binomial process to infer the inherent structure of somatic mutation profiles through latent representations. This stochastic process takes into account different, yet correlated, co-occurring mutations using profile-specific negative binomial dispersion parameters that are mixed with a correlated beta-Bernoulli process and a probability parameter to model profile heterogeneity. These model parameters are inferred by iterative optimization via amortized and stochastic variational inference using the Pan Cancer dataset from The Cancer Genomic Archive (TCGA). By examining the the latent space, we identify biologically relevant correlations between somatic mutations.",2020-05-21T21:52:35Z,2020-05-21T21:52:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10919v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10919v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, q-bio.GN"

We consider a scenario in which an agent requests recommendations from multiple parties to build trust toward another agent. At the collection level, we propose to allow agents to self-assess the accuracy of their recommendations and autonomously decide on whether they would participate in the recommendation process or not. At the processing level, we propose a recommendations aggregation technique that is resilient to collusion attacks, followed by a credibility update mechanism for the participating agents. The originality of our work stems from its consideration of dishonest opinions at both the collection and processing levels, which allows for better and more persistent protection against dishonest recommenders.

Human brain activity for machine attention,"Lukas Muttenthaler, Nora Hollenstein, Maria Barrett","Cognitively inspired NLP leverages human-derived data to teach machines about language processing mechanisms. Recently, neural networks have been augmented with behavioral data to solve a range of NLP tasks spanning syntax and semantics. We are the first to exploit neuroscientific data, namely electroencephalography (EEG), to inform a neural attention model about language processing of the human brain. The challenge in working with EEG data is that features are exceptionally rich and need extensive pre-processing to isolate signals specific to text processing. We devise a method for finding such EEG features to supervise machine attention through combining theoretically motivated cropping with random forest tree splits. After this dimensionality reduction, the pre-processed EEG features are capable of distinguishing two reading tasks retrieved from a publicly available EEG corpus. We apply these features to regularise attention on relation classification and show that EEG is more informative than strong baselines. This improvement depends on both the cognitive load of the task and the EEG frequency domain. Hence, informing neural attention models with EEG signals is beneficial but requires further investigation to understand which dimensions are the most useful across NLP tasks.",2020-06-09T08:39:07Z,2020-10-02T22:06:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05113v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05113v2,"cs.CL, cs.LG, q-bio.NC"

In practice, simulating such rough processes thus often results in high computational cost. To remedy this, we study approximations of stochastic Volterra equations using an $N$-dimensional diffusion process defined as solution to a system of ordinary stochastic differential equation. If the coefficients of the stochastic Volterra equation are Lipschitz continuous, we show that these approximations converge strongly with superpolynomial rate in $N$.

The Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion is independent of observed data and depends only on the covariance kernel and the size of the interval on which the Gaussian process is defined. The scheme of this paper does not require translation invariance of the covariance kernel.

In this research, we use a variation of the Alternating Direction Implicit method to solve a partial differential equation that models part of the wound healing process. Wound images are used as the dataset that we analyze. To segment the image's wound, we implement deep learning-based models. We show that the combination of a variant of the Alternating Direction Implicit method and Deep Learning provides a reasonably accurate model for the process of wound healing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine both numerical PDE and deep learning techniques in an automated system to capture the long-term behavior of wound healing.",2021-11-27T21:58:39Z,2022-09-13T18:50:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15632v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15632v2,"physics.med-ph, eess.IV, math.AP"
Fair Data Representation for Machine Learning at the Pareto Frontier,"Shizhou Xu, Thomas Strohmer","As machine learning powered decision-making becomes increasingly important in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness in the underlying data processing. We propose a pre-processing algorithm for fair data representation via which supervised learning results in estimations of the Pareto frontier between prediction error and statistical disparity. Particularly, the present work applies the optimal affine transport to approach the post-processing Wasserstein-2 barycenter characterization of the optimal fair $L^2$-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. Furthermore, we show that the Wasserstein-2 geodesics from the conditional (on sensitive information) distributions of the learning outcome to their barycenter characterizes the Pareto frontier between $L^2$-loss and the average pairwise Wasserstein-2 distance among sensitive groups on the learning outcome. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with arbitrary conditional expectation estimation supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the fair representation protects the sensitive information by limiting the inference capability of the remaining data with respect to the sensitive data; (3) the optimal affine maps are computationally efficient even for high-dimensional data.",2022-01-02T05:05:26Z,2023-11-24T15:06:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00292v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00292v4,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.PR"

Stationary GE-Process and its Application in Analyzing Gold Price Data,Debasis Kundu,"In this paper we introduce a new discrete time and continuous state space stationary process $\{X_n; n = 1, 2, \ldots \}$, such that $X_n$ follows a two-parameter generalized exponential (GE) distribution. Joint distribution functions, characterization and some dependency properties of this new process have been investigated. The GE-process has three unknown parameters, two shape parameters and one scale parameter, and due to this reason it is more flexible than the existing exponential process. In presence of the scale parameter, if the two shape parameters are equal, then the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters can be obtained by solving one non-linear equation and if the two shape parameters are arbitrary, then the maximum likelihood estimators can be obtained by solving a two dimensional optimization problem. Two {\color{black} synthetic} data sets, and one real gold-price data set have been analyzed to see the performance of the proposed model in practice.

Cross-Modal ASR Post-Processing System for Error Correction and   Utterance Rejection,"Jing Du, Shiliang Pu, Qinbo Dong, Chao Jin, Xin Qi, Dian Gu, Ru Wu, Hongwei Zhou","Although modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can achieve high performance, they may produce errors that weaken readers' experience and do harm to downstream tasks. To improve the accuracy and reliability of ASR hypotheses, we propose a cross-modal post-processing system for speech recognizers, which 1) fuses acoustic features and textual features from different modalities, 2) joints a confidence estimator and an error corrector in multi-task learning fashion and 3) unifies error correction and utterance rejection modules. Compared with single-modal or single-task models, our proposed system is proved to be more effective and efficient. Experiment result shows that our post-processing system leads to more than 10% relative reduction of character error rate (CER) for both single-speaker and multi-speaker speech on our industrial ASR system, with about 1.7ms latency for each token, which ensures that extra latency introduced by post-processing is acceptable in streaming speech recognition.",2022-01-10T12:29:55Z,2022-01-10T12:29:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03313v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03313v1,"eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD"
A sojourn-based approach to semi-Markov Reinforcement Learning,"Giacomo Ascione, Salvatore Cuomo","In this paper we introduce a new approach to discrete-time semi-Markov decision processes based on the sojourn time process. Different characterizations of discrete-time semi-Markov processes are exploited and decision processes are constructed by their means. With this new approach, the agent is allowed to consider different actions depending also on the sojourn time of the process in the current state. A numerical method based on $Q$-learning algorithms for finite horizon reinforcement learning and stochastic recursive relations is investigated. Finally, we consider two toy examples: one in which the reward depends on the sojourn-time, according to the gambler's fallacy; the other in which the environment is semi-Markov even if the reward function does not depend on the sojourn time. These are used to carry on some numerical evaluations on the previously presented $Q$-learning algorithm and on a different naive method based on deep reinforcement learning.",2022-01-18T08:55:47Z,2022-04-20T14:26:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06827v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06827v2,"math.PR, cs.NA, math.NA"
A Knowledge-driven Business Process Analysis Canvas,Michele Missikoff,"Business process (BP) analysis represents a first key phase of information system development. It consists in the gathering of domain knowledge and its organization to be later used in the software development, and beyond (e.g., for Business Process Reengineering). The quality of the developed information system largely depends on how the BP analysis has been carried out and the quality of the produced requirement specification documents. Despite the fact that the issue is on the table for decades, business process analysis is still a critical phase of information systems development. One promising strategy is an early and more important involvement of business experts in the BP analysis. This paper presents a methodology that aims at an early involvement of business experts while providing a formal grounding that guarantees the quality of the produced specifications. To this end, we propose the Business Process Analysis Canvas, a knowledge framework organized in eight knowledge sections aimed at supporting the business expert in carrying out the analysis, eventually yielding a BP analysis Ontology.",2022-01-18T10:34:00Z,2022-01-18T10:34:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06860v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06860v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI, H.4.1; D.2.2; D.2.3; D.2.6; D.2.9"

Our results help assess the accuracy of perturbative methods in calculating the irreversible work for cases where an exact solution does not exist.

Gabor-like filters have been observed in the early layers of CNN classifiers and even throughout low-level image processing networks. In this work, we take this observation to the extreme and explicitly constrain the filters of a natural-image denoising CNN to be learned 2D real Gabor filters. Surprisingly, we find that the proposed network (GDLNet) can achieve near state-of-the-art denoising performance amongst popular fully convolutional neural networks, with only a fraction of the learned parameters. We further verify that this parameterization maintains the noise-level generalization (training vs. inference mismatch) characteristics of the base network, and investigate the contribution of individual Gabor filter parameters to the performance of the denoiser. We present positive findings for the interpretation of dictionary learning networks as performing accelerated sparse-coding via the importance of untied learned scale parameters between network layers.

Circumventing the Curse of Dimensionality in Prediction: Causal   Rate-Distortion for Infinite-Order Markov Processes,"Sarah Marzen, James P. Crutchfield","Predictive rate-distortion analysis suffers from the curse of dimensionality: clustering arbitrarily long pasts to retain information about arbitrarily long futures requires resources that typically grow exponentially with length. The challenge is compounded for infinite-order Markov processes, since conditioning on finite sequences cannot capture all of their past dependencies. Spectral arguments show that algorithms which cluster finite-length sequences fail dramatically when the underlying process has long-range temporal correlations and can fail even for processes generated by finite-memory hidden Markov models. We circumvent the curse of dimensionality in rate-distortion analysis of infinite-order processes by casting predictive rate-distortion objective functions in terms of the forward- and reverse-time causal states of computational mechanics. Examples demonstrate that the resulting causal rate-distortion theory substantially improves current predictive rate-distortion analyses.",2014-12-09T05:23:27Z,2014-12-09T05:23:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2859v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2859v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.LG, nlin.CD, q-bio.NC, stat.ML"

End-to-End Optimization of High Throughput DNA Sequencing,"Eliza O'Reilly, Francois Baccelli, Gustavo de Veciana, Haris Vikalo","At the core of high throughput DNA sequencing platforms lies a bio-physical surface process that results in a random geometry of clusters of homogenous short DNA fragments typically hundreds of base pairs long - bridge amplification. The statistical properties of this random process and length of the fragments are critical as they affect the information that can be subsequently extracted, i.e., density of successfully inferred DNA fragment reads. The ensemble of overlapping DNA fragment reads are then used to computationally reconstruct the much longer target genome sequence, e.g, ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of base pairs. The success of the reconstruction in turn depends on having a sufficiently large ensemble of DNA fragments that are sufficiently long. In this paper using stochastic geometry we model and optimize the end-to-end process linking and partially controlling the statistics of the physical processes to the success of the computational step. This provides, for the first time, a framework capturing salient features of such sequencing platforms that can be used to study cost, performance or sensitivity of the sequencing process.",2015-08-04T13:50:52Z,2015-08-04T13:50:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02930v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02930v1,"q-bio.GN, math.PR, 92D20, 60D05, 60K25"

In varying-coefficient models with Gaussian process priors, a Gaussian process generates the functional relationship between the task variables and the parameters of this conditional. Varying-coefficient models subsume hierarchical Bayesian multitask models, but also generalizations in which the conditional varies continuously, for instance, in time or space. However, Bayesian inference in varying-coefficient models is generally intractable. We show that inference for varying-coefficient models with isotropic Gaussian process priors resolves to standard inference for a Gaussian process that can be solved efficiently. MAP inference in this model resolves to multitask learning using task and instance kernels, and inference for hierarchical Bayesian multitask models can be carried out efficiently using graph-Laplacian kernels.

We consider a special case of the one dimensional misanthrope process whose probability distribution is completely equivalent to the ordinary simple exclusion process under the periodic boundary condition. By imposing open boundaries, high- and low-density domains can coexist in the system, which we investigate by Monte Carlo simulations. We examine finite-size corrections of density profiles and correlation functions, when the jump rule for particles is symmetric. Moreover, we study properties of delocalized and localized shocks in the case of the totally asymmetric jump rule.

Process convergence for the complexity of Radix Selection on Markov   sources,"Kevin Leckey, Ralph Neininger, Henning Sulzbach","A fundamental algorithm for selecting ranks from a finite subset of an ordered set is Radix Selection. This algorithm requires the data to be given as strings of symbols over an ordered alphabet, e.g., binary expansions of real numbers. Its complexity is measured by the number of symbols that have to be read. In this paper the model of independent data identically generated from a Markov chain is considered. The complexity is studied as a stochastic process indexed by the set of infinite strings over the given alphabet. The orders of mean and variance of the complexity and, after normalization, a limit theorem with a centered Gaussian process as limit are derived. This implies an analysis for two standard models for the ranks: uniformly chosen ranks, also called grand averages, and the worst case rank complexities which are of interest in computer science. For uniform data and the asymmetric Bernoulli model (i.e. memoryless sources), we also find weak convergence for the normalized process of complexities when indexed by the ranks while for more general Markov sources these processes are not tight under the standard normalizations.",2016-05-08T19:27:10Z,2017-10-02T19:42:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02352v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02352v2,"math.PR, cs.DS, 60F17, 60G15, 68P10, 60C05, 68Q25"

Gain and loss in open quantum systems,"Hichem Eleuch, Ingrid Rotter","Photosynthesis is the basic process used by plants to convert light energy in reaction centers into chemical energy. The high efficiency of this process is not yet understood today. Using the formalism for the description of open quantum systems by means of a non-Hermitian Hamilton operator, we consider initially the interplay of gain (acceptor) and loss (donor). Near singular points it causes fluctuations of the cross section which appear without any excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the system. This process occurs therefore very quickly and with high efficiency. We then consider the excitation of resonance states of the system by means of these fluctuations. This second step of the whole process takes place much slower than the first one, because it involves the excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the system. The two-step process as a whole is highly efficient and the decay is bi-exponential. We provide, if possible, the results of analytical studies, otherwise characteristic numerical results.

Topology-dependent density optima for efficient simultaneous network   exploration,"Daniel B. Wilson, Ruth E. Baker, Francis G. Woodhouse","A random search process in a networked environment is governed by the time it takes to visit every node, termed the cover time. Often, a networked process does not proceed in isolation but competes with many instances of itself within the same environment. A key unanswered question is how to optimise this process: how many concurrent searchers can a topology support before the benefits of parallelism are outweighed by competition for space? Here, we introduce the searcher-averaged parallel cover time (APCT) to quantify these economies of scale. We show that the APCT of the networked symmetric exclusion process is optimised at a searcher density that is well predicted by the spectral gap. Furthermore, we find that non-equilibrium processes, realised through the addition of bias, can support significantly increased density optima.

Dynamic pricing in retail with diffusion process demand,Asbj√∏rn Nilsen Riseth,"When randomness in demand affects the sales of a product, retailers use dynamic pricing strategies to maximize their profits. In this article, we formulate the pricing problem as a continuous-time stochastic optimal control problem and find the optimal policy by solving the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. We propose a new approach to modelling the randomness in the dynamics of sales based on diffusion processes. The model assumes a continuum approximation to the stock levels of the retailer which should scale much better to large-inventory problems than the existing Poisson process models in the revenue management literature. The diffusion process approach also enables modelling of the demand volatility, whereas Poisson process models do not.   We present closed-form solutions to the HJB equation when there is no randomness in the system. It turns out that the deterministic pricing policy is near-optimal for systems with demand uncertainty. Numerical errors in calculating the optimal pricing policy may, in fact, result in a lower profit on average than with the heuristic pricing policy.",2017-09-28T08:48:58Z,2018-05-30T16:11:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09852v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09852v2,"math.OC, math.DS, 49J20, 93E20"
A Bio-inspired Redundant Sensing Architecture,"Anh Tuan Nguyen, Jian Xu, Zhi Yang","Sensing is the process of deriving signals from the environment that allows artificial systems to interact with the physical world. The Shannon theorem specifies the maximum rate at which information can be acquired. However, this upper bound is hard to achieve in many man-made systems. The biological visual systems, on the other hand, have highly efficient signal representation and processing mechanisms that allow precise sensing. In this work, we argue that redundancy is one of the critical characteristics for such superior performance. We show architectural advantages by utilizing redundant sensing, including correction of mismatch error and significant precision enhancement. For a proof-of-concept demonstration, we have designed a heuristic-based analog-to-digital converter - a zero-dimensional quantizer. Through Monte Carlo simulation with the error probabilistic distribution as a priori, the performance approaching the Shannon limit is feasible. In actual measurements without knowing the error distribution, we observe at least 2-bit extra precision.

Moreover, most envisioned biophysical applications are at room temperature, which further limits detection due to significant thermal noise. Here, we theoretically demonstrate reliable transduction of forces into electronic currents via locally suspended graphene nanoribbons subject to ultra-low flexural deflection. The decay of electronic couplings with distance magnifies the effect of the deflection, giving rise to measurable electronic current changes even in aqueous solution. Due to thermal fluctuations, the characteristic charge carrier transmission peak follows a generalized Voigt profile, behavior which is reflected in the optimized sensor. The intrinsic sensitivity is less than 7 fN/$\sqrt{\mathbf{Hz}}$, allowing for the detection of ultra-weak and fast processes at room temperature. Graphene deflectometry thus presents new opportunities in the sensing and detection of molecular-scale processes, from ion dynamics to DNA sequencing and protein folding, in their native environment.",2018-04-08T14:56:49Z,2018-04-08T14:56:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02701v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02701v1,"cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.stat-mech"
Active Mini-Batch Sampling using Repulsive Point Processes,"Cheng Zhang, Cengiz √ñztireli, Stephan Mandt, Giampiero Salvi","The convergence speed of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be improved by actively selecting mini-batches. We explore sampling schemes where similar data points are less likely to be selected in the same mini-batch. In particular, we prove that such repulsive sampling schemes lowers the variance of the gradient estimator. This generalizes recent work on using Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) for mini-batch diversification (Zhang et al., 2017) to the broader class of repulsive point processes. We first show that the phenomenon of variance reduction by diversified sampling generalizes in particular to non-stationary point processes. We then show that other point processes may be computationally much more efficient than DPPs. In particular, we propose and investigate Poisson Disk sampling---frequently encountered in the computer graphics community---for this task. We show empirically that our approach improves over standard SGD both in terms of convergence speed as well as final model performance.",2018-04-08T22:48:20Z,2018-06-20T15:12:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02772v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02772v2,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG"
A fuzzy process of individuation,Juliano C. S. Neves,"It is shown that an aspect of the process of individuation may be thought of as a fuzzy set. The process of individuation has been interpreted as a two-valued problem in the history of philosophy. In this work, I intend to show that such a process in its psychosocial aspect is better understood in terms of a fuzzy set, characterized by a continuum membership function. According to this perspective, species and their members present different degrees of individuation. Such degrees are measured from the membership function of the psychosocial process of individuation. Thus, a social analysis is suggested by using this approach in human societies.",2018-04-12T15:25:15Z,2019-08-09T17:15:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04568v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04568v2,"physics.soc-ph, math.HO, stat.AP"
On Convergence of Moments for Approximating Processes and Applications   to Surrogate Models,Ansgar Steland,"We study critera for a pair $ (\{ X_n \} $, $ \{ Y_n \}) $ of approximating processes which guarantee closeness of moments by generalizing known results for the special case that $ Y_n = Y $ for all $n$ and $ X_n $ converges to $Y$ in probability. This problem especially arises when working with surrogate models, e.g. to enrich observed data by simulated data, where the surrogates $Y_n$'s are constructed to justify that they approximate the $ X_n $'s.   The results of this paper deal with sequences of random variables. Since this framework does not cover many applications where surrogate models such as deep neural networks are used to approximate more general stochastic processes, we extend the results to the more general framework of random fields of stochastic processes. This framework especially covers image data and sequences of images. We show that uniform integrability is sufficient, and this holds even for the case of processes provided they satisfy a weak stationarity condition.",2018-04-28T15:36:56Z,2018-04-28T15:36:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10821v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10821v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.TH, 68T01, 62M40, 62M45, 68T05"
Universal behavior of the corners of Orbital Beta Processes,Cesar Cuenca,"There is a unique unitarily-invariant ensemble of $N\times N$ Hermitian matrices with a fixed set of real eigenvalues $a_1 > \dots > a_N$. The joint eigenvalue distribution of the $(N - 1)$ top-left principal submatrices of a random matrix from this ensemble is called the orbital unitary process. There are analogous matrix ensembles of symmetric and quaternionic Hermitian matrices that lead to the orbital orthogonal and symplectic processes, respectively. By extrapolation, on the dimension of the base field, of the explicit density formulas, we define the orbital beta processes. We prove the universal behavior of the virtual eigenvalues of the smallest $m$ principal submatrices, when $m$ is independent of $N$ and in such a way that the rescaled empirical measures converge weakly. The limiting object is the Gaussian beta corners process. As a byproduct of our approach, we prove a theorem on the asymptotics of multivariate Bessel functions.",2018-07-16T22:19:55Z,2019-07-29T15:56:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06134v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06134v2,"math.PR, math-ph, math.CA, math.MP, 60B20 (Primary), 33E30 (Secondary)"

Concentration of scalar ergodic diffusions and some statistical   implications,"Cathrine Aeckerle-Willems, Claudia Strauch","We derive uniform concentration inequalities for continuous-time analogues of empirical processes and related stochastic integrals of scalar ergodic diffusion processes. Thereby, we lay the foundation typically required for the study of sup-norm properties of estimation procedures for a large class of diffusion processes. In the classical i.i.d. context, a key device for the statistical sup-norm analysis is provided by Talagrand-type concentration inequalities. Aiming for a parallel substitute in the diffusion framework, we present a systematic, self-contained approach to such uniform concentration inequalities via martingale approximation and moment bounds obtained by the generic chaining method. The developed machinery is of independent probabilistic interest and can serve as a starting point for investigations of other processes such as more general Markov processes, in particular multivariate or discretely observed diffusions. As a first concrete statistical application, we analyse the sup-norm error of estimating the invariant density of an ergodic diffusion via the natural local time estimator and the classical nonparametric kernel density estimator, respectively.",2018-07-30T13:07:30Z,2019-07-12T14:55:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11331v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11331v2,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.TH, 62M05, 60J60, 60J55, 62G07"
Efficient Bayesian Inference of Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox Processes,"Christian Donner, Manfred Opper","We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for estimating the intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process, where the intensity function is modelled using a Gaussian process (GP) prior via a sigmoid link function. Augmenting the model using a latent marked Poisson process and P\'olya--Gamma random variables we obtain a representation of the likelihood which is conjugate to the GP prior. We estimate the posterior using a variational free--form mean field optimisation together with the framework of sparse GPs. Furthermore, as alternative approximation we suggest a sparse Laplace's method for the posterior, for which an efficient expectation--maximisation algorithm is derived to find the posterior's mode. Both algorithms compare well against exact inference obtained by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and standard variational Gauss approach solving the same model, while being one order of magnitude faster. Furthermore, the performance and speed of our method is competitive with that of another recently proposed Poisson process model based on a quadratic link function, while not being limited to GPs with squared exponential kernels and rectangular domains.",2018-08-02T14:32:58Z,2019-05-03T07:12:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00831v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00831v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG, 60G55"
Probing multipulse laser ablation by means of self-mixing interferometry,"Simone Donadello, Ali G√∂khan Demir, Barbara Previtali","In this work, self-mixing interferometry (SMI) is implemented inline to a laser microdrilling system to monitor the machining process by probing the ablation-induced plume. An analytical model based on the Sedov-Taylor blast wave equation is developed for the expansion of the process plume under multiple-pulse laser percussion drilling conditions. Signals were acquired during laser microdrilling of blind holes on stainless steel, copper alloy, pure titanium, and titanium nitride ceramic coating. The maximum optical path difference was measured from the signals to estimate the refractive index changes. An amplitude coefficient was derived by fitting the analytical model to the measured optical path differences. The morphology of the drilled holes was investigated in terms of maximum hole depth and dross height. The results indicate that the SMI signal rises when the ablation process is dominated by vaporization, changing the refractive index of the processing zone significantly. Such ablation conditions correspond to limited formation of dross. The results imply that SMI can be used as a nonintrusive tool in laser micromachining applications for monitoring the process quality in an indirect way.",2018-08-04T14:43:46Z,2018-11-30T11:19:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02015v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02015v2,"physics.app-ph, physics.ins-det, physics.optics, physics.plasm-ph"
Optimal control of Markov-modulated multiclass many-server queues,"Ari Arapostathis, Anirban Das, Guodong Pang, Yi Zheng","We study multiclass many-server queues for which the arrival, service and abandonment rates are all modulated by a common finite-state Markov process. We assume that the system operates in the ""averaged"" Halfin-Whitt regime, which means that it is critically loaded in the average sense, although not necessarily in each state of the Markov process. We show that under any static priority policy, the Markov-modulated diffusion-scaled queueing process is geometrically ergodic. This is accomplished by employing a solution to an associated Poisson equation in order to construct a suitable Lyapunov function. We establish a functional central limit theorem for the diffusion-scaled queueing process and show that the limiting process is a controlled diffusion with piecewise linear drift and constant covariance matrix.

A General Framework of Multi-Armed Bandit Processes by Arm Switch   Restrictions,"Wenqing Bao, Xiaoqiang Cai, Xianyi Wu","This paper proposes a general framework of multi-armed bandit (MAB) processes by introducing a type of restrictions on the switches among arms evolving in continuous time.   The Gittins index process is constructed for any single arm subject to the restrictions on switches and then the optimality of the corresponding Gittins index rule is established. The Gittins indices defined in this paper are consistent with the ones for MAB processes in continuous time, integer time, semi-Markovian setting as well as general discrete time setting, so that the new theory covers the classical models as special cases and also applies to many other situations that have not yet been touched in the literature. While the proof of the optimality of Gittins index policies benefits from ideas in the existing theory of MAB processes in continuous time, new techniques are introduced which drastically simplify the proof.",2018-08-20T05:47:41Z,2018-08-22T05:25:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06314v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06314v2,"math.PR, cs.LG, math.OC, stat.ML, 90C39, 93E20, 93E35, 49L20"

This computational tool is based on analytic formulas obtained from deriving and solving the hydrodynamic limit of the process. It allows an immediate quantification of the particle density, flux, and phase diagram, as a function of a few key parameters associated with the system, which would be difficult to achieve via conventional stochastic simulations.

Observations typically arrive in data streams and practitioners wish to continuously monitor their experiments, sequentially testing hypotheses while maintaining Type I error probabilities under optional stopping and continuation. These goals are frequently complicated in practice by non-stationary time dynamics. We provide practical solutions through sequential tests of multinomial hypotheses, hypotheses about many inhomogeneous Bernoulli processes and hypotheses about many time-inhomogeneous Poisson counting processes. For estimation, we further provide confidence sequences for multinomial probability vectors, all contrasts among probabilities of inhomogeneous Bernoulli processes and all contrasts among intensities of time-inhomogeneous Poisson counting processes.

We focus on the interpolation of sensors' measurements from a small number of measurements uploaded by a fraction of sensors using Gaussian process regression with data-aided sensing. Thanks to active sensor selection, it is shown that Gaussian process regression with data-aided sensing can provide a good estimate of a complete data set compared to that with random selection. With multichannel ALOHA, data-aided sensing is generalized for distributed selective uploading when sensors can have feedback of predictions of their measurements so that each sensor can decide whether or not it uploads by comparing its measurement with the predicted one.

In this paper we introduce discrete-lattice signal processing (DLSP), an SP framework for data, or signals, indexed by such lattices. We use the meet (or join) to define a shift operation and derive associated notions of filtering, Fourier basis and transform, and frequency response. We show that the spectrum of a lattice signal inherits the lattice structure of the signal domain and derive a sampling theorem. Finally, we show two prototypical applications: spectral analysis of formal concept lattices in social science and sampling and Wiener filtering of multiset lattices in combinatorial auctions.

In this paper, we formulate an evaluation framework to quantify the level of compliance of business processes across different levels of abstraction (such as task,trace and process level) and across multiple dimensions of each task (such as temporal, monetary, role-, data-, and quality-related) to provide managers more useful information about their operations and to help them improve their decision making processes.

A Renormalization Group Approach to Connect Discrete- and   Continuous-Time Descriptions of Gaussian Processes,"Federica Ferretti, Victor Chard√®s, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra M Walczak, Irene Giardina","Discretization of continuous stochastic processes is needed to numerically simulate them or to infer models from experimental time series. However, depending on the nature of the process, the same discretization scheme, if not accurate enough, may perform very differently for the two tasks. Exact discretizations, which work equally well at any scale, are characterized by the property of invariance under coarse-graining. Motivated by this observation, we build an explicit Renormalization Group approach for Gaussian time series generated by auto-regressive models. We show that the RG fixed points correspond to discretizations of linear SDEs, and only come in the form of first order Markov processes or non-Markovian ones. This fact provides an alternative explanation of why standard delay-vector embedding procedures fail in reconstructing partially observed noise-driven systems. We also suggest a possible effective Markovian discretization for the inference of partially observed underdamped equilibrium processes based on the exploitation of the Einstein relation.",2021-01-16T17:11:02Z,2021-12-07T16:41:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06482v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06482v4,"stat.ML, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.LG"

Further, we obtain a large deviations principle for the active particle in terms of the large deviations rate function of the empirical process corresponding to the state process. Again we show that the rate function and free energy function are (pointwise) optimal for reversible state processes.

Higher-order percolation processes on multiplex hypergraphs,"Hanlin Sun, Ginestra Bianconi","Higher order interactions are increasingly recognised as a fundamental aspect of complex systems ranging from the brain to social contact networks. Hypergraph as well as simplicial complexes capture the higher-order interactions of complex systems and allow to investigate the relation between their higher-order structure and their function. Here we establish a general framework for assessing hypergraph robustness and we characterize the critical properties of simple and higher-order percolation processes. This general framework builds on the formulation of the random multiplex hypergraph ensemble where each layer is characterized by hyperedges of given cardinality. We reveal the relation between higher-order percolation processes in random multiplex hypergraphs, interdependent percolation of multiplex networks and K-core percolation. The structural correlations of the random multiplex hypergraphs are shown to have a significant effect on their percolation properties. The wide range of critical behaviors observed for higher-order percolation processes on multiplex hypergraphs elucidates the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of discontinuous transition and uncovers interesting critical properties which can be applied to the study of epidemic spreading and contagion processes on higher-order networks.",2021-04-12T13:25:03Z,2021-04-12T13:25:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05457v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05457v1,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.SI"
Economic MPC of Markov Decision Processes: Dissipativity in Undiscounted   Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control,"S√©bastien Gros, Mario Zanon","Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) dissipativity theory is central to discussing the stability of policies resulting from minimizing economic stage costs. In its current form, the dissipativity theory for economic MPC applies to problems based on deterministic dynamics or to very specific classes of stochastic problems, and does not readily extend to generic Markov Decision Processes. In this paper, we clarify the core reason for this difficulty, and propose a generalization of the economic MPC dissipativity theory that circumvents it. This generalization focuses on undiscounted infinite-horizon problems and is based on nonlinear stage cost functionals, allowing one to discuss the Lyapunov asymptotic stability of policies for Markov Decision Processes in terms of the probability measures underlying their stochastic dynamics. This theory is illustrated for the stochastic Linear Quadratic Regulator with Gaussian process noise, for which a storage functional can be provided explicitly. For the sake of brevity, we limit our discussion to undiscounted Markov Decision Processes.",2021-04-22T11:36:08Z,2022-07-22T15:58:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10997v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10997v3,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.OC"

We expect that, by using the kit and the software, the users could experiment in a short period the various steps in developing a DMI such as physical structure, electronics, programming, mapping, and sound design. Our approach to popularizing the DMI development process is twofold: reducing the cognitive load for beginners by encapsulating technical details and lowering the costs of the kit by using simple components and open-source software.

Point Cloud Audio Processing,"Krishna Subramani, Paris Smaragdis","Most audio processing pipelines involve transformations that act on fixed-dimensional input representations of audio. For example, when using the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) the DFT size specifies a fixed dimension for the input representation. As a consequence, most audio machine learning models are designed to process fixed-size vector inputs which often prohibits the repurposing of learned models on audio with different sampling rates or alternative representations. We note, however, that the intrinsic spectral information in the audio signal is invariant to the choice of the input representation or the sampling rate. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel way of processing audio signals by treating them as a collection of points in feature space, and we use point cloud machine learning models that give us invariance to the choice of representation parameters, such as DFT size or the sampling rate. Additionally, we observe that these methods result in smaller models, and allow us to significantly subsample the input representation with minimal effects to a trained model performance.",2021-05-06T07:04:59Z,2021-07-29T06:32:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02469v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02469v2,"eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD"

To train our network with non-differentiable black-box effects layers, we use a fast, parallel stochastic gradient approximation scheme within a standard auto differentiation graph, yielding efficient end-to-end backpropagation. We demonstrate the power of our approach with three separate automatic audio production applications: tube amplifier emulation, automatic removal of breaths and pops from voice recordings, and automatic music mastering. We validate our results with a subjective listening test, showing our approach not only can enable new automatic audio effects tasks, but can yield results comparable to a specialized, state-of-the-art commercial solution for music mastering.",2021-05-11T02:20:22Z,2021-05-11T02:20:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04752v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04752v1,"eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD, eess.SP"
Convergence of the height process of supercritical Galton-Watson forests   with an application to the configuration model in the critical window,Serte Donderwinkel,"We show joint convergence of the Lukasiewicz path and height process for slightly supercritical Galton-Watson forests. This shows that the height processes for supercritical continuous state branching processes as constructed by Lambert (2002) are the limit under rescaling of their discrete counterparts. Unlike for (sub-)critical Galton-Watson forests, the height process does not encode the entire metric structure of a supercritical Galton-Watson forest. We demonstrate that this result is nonetheless useful, by applying it to the configuration model with an i.i.d. power-law degree sequence in the critical window, of which we obtain the metric space scaling limit in the product Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology, which is of independent interest.",2021-05-25T17:45:16Z,2021-11-12T13:26:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12109v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12109v2,"math.PR, math.CO, 60C05"

Convergent processing of the world may be one factor that contributes to social connections between individuals. We used neuroimaging and network analysis to investigate whether the most central individuals in their communities (as measured by in-degree centrality, a notion of popularity) process the world in a particularly normative way. We found that more central individuals had exceptionally similar neural responses to their peers and especially to each other in brain regions that are associated with high-level interpretations and social cognition (e.g., in the default-mode network), whereas less-central individuals exhibited more idiosyncratic responses. Self-reported enjoyment of and interest in stimuli followed a similar pattern, but accounting for these data did not change our main results.

A recent addition to this family, Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNP), have shown remarkable improvement in performance over prior art, but we find that they sometimes struggle to generalize when applied to time series data. In particular, they are not robust to distribution shifts and fail to extrapolate observed patterns into the future. By incorporating a Gaussian Process into the model, we are able to remedy this and at the same time improve performance within distribution.

A comparative study of model approximation methods applied to economic   MPC,"Zhiyinan Huang, Qinyao Liu, Jinfeng Liu, Biao Huang","Economic model predictive control (EMPC) has attracted significant attention in recent years and is recognized as a promising advanced process control method for the next generation smart manufacturing. It can lead to improving economic performance but at the same time increases the computational complexity significantly. Model approximation has been a standard approach for reducing computational complexity in process control. In this work, we perform a study on three types of representative model approximation methods applied to EMPC, including model reduction based on available first-principle models (e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition), system identification based on input-output data (e.g., subspace identification) that results in an explicitly expressed mathematical model, and neural networks based on input-output data. A representative algorithm from each model approximation method is considered. Two processes that are very different in dynamic nature and complexity were selected as benchmark processes for computational complexity and economic performance comparison, namely an alkylation process and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The strengths and drawbacks of each method are summarized according to the simulation results, with future research direction regarding control oriented model approximation proposed at the end.",2021-06-21T17:02:22Z,2021-06-21T17:02:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11258v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11258v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.OC"
Growth rate of a stochastic growth process driven by an exponential   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Dan Pirjol,"We study the stochastic growth process in discrete time $x_{i+1} = (1 + \mu_i) x_i$ with growth rate $\mu_i = \rho e^{Z_i - \frac12 var(Z_i)}$ proportional to the exponential of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process $dZ_t = - \gamma Z_t dt + \sigma dW_t$ sampled on a grid of uniformly spaced times $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^n$ with time step $\tau$. Using large deviation theory methods we compute the asymptotic growth rate (Lyapunov exponent) $\lambda = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \log \mathbb{E}[x_n]$. We show that this limit exists, under appropriate scaling of the O-U parameters, and can be expressed as the solution of a variational problem. The asymptotic growth rate is related to the thermodynamical pressure of a one-dimensional lattice gas with attractive exponential potentials. For $Z_t$ a stationary O-U process the lattice gas coincides with a system considered previously by Kac and Helfand. We derive upper and lower bounds on $\lambda$. In the large mean-reversion limit $\gamma n \tau \gg 1$ the two bounds converge and the growth rate is given by a lattice version of the van der Waals equation of state. The predictions are tested against numerical simulations of the stochastic growth model.",2021-06-22T15:43:02Z,2021-06-22T15:43:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11874v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11874v1,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP"

We find a rich phenomenology of quantum dephasing processes which can be interpreted in classical terms. In particular, if the underlying dephasing process is Markovian, we find sufficient conditions under which classicality at every order can be found: this can be reached by choosing the dephasing and measurement basis to be fully compatible or fully incompatible, that is, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). For non-Markovian processes, classicality can only be proven in the fully compatible case, thus revealing a key difference between Markovian and non-Markovian pure dephasing processes.",2022-11-03T17:27:59Z,2022-11-25T08:56:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02014v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02014v2,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"
Perturbative Understanding of Non-Perturbative Processes and   Quantumization versus Classicalization,"Gia Dvali, Lukas Eisemann","In some instances of study of quantum evolution of classical backgrounds it is considered inevitable to resort to non-perturbative methods at the price of treating the system semiclassically. We show that a fully quantum perturbative treatment, in which the background is resolved as a multi-particle state, recovers the semiclassical non-perturbative results and allows going beyond. We reproduce particle-creation by a classical field in a theory of two scalars as well as in scalar QED in terms of scattering processes of high multiplicity. The multi-particle treatment also gives a transparent picture of why a single-process transition from a classical to a quantum state, which we call quantumization, is exponentially suppressed, whereas the opposite process, classicalization, can take place swiftly if the microstate degeneracy of the classical state is high. An example is provided by the $N$-graviton portrait of a black hole: a black hole can form efficiently via a $2\to N$ classicalization process in the collision of high-energy particles but its quantumization via a decay $N \to 2$ is exponentially suppressed.",2022-11-04T17:38:18Z,2022-11-04T17:38:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02618v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02618v1,"hep-th, gr-qc, quant-ph"

Despite their significance, analytical solutions to basic problems remain unknown, e.g. the detection time of a diffusing particle by a gated interval, disk, or sphere. In this paper, we elucidate the challenges posed by continuous gated first-passage processes and present a renewal framework to overcome them. This framework offers a unified approach for a wide range of problems, including those with single-point, half-line, and interval targets. The latter have so far evaded exact solutions. Our analysis reveals that solutions to gated problems can be obtained directly from the ungated dynamics. This, in turn, reveals universal properties and asymptotic behaviors, shedding light on cryptic intermediate-time regimes and refining the notion of high-crypticity for continuous-space gated processes. Moreover, we extend our formalism to higher dimensions, showcasing its versatility and applicability.

Considered wavelets have compact support and are twice continuously differentiable. The number of vanishing moments of mother wavelet is proportional to the number of nonzero coefficients in the linear process and to the rate of decay of characteristic function of innovations.

The stochastic factor process $Y$ has continuous trajectories but is not even required to be a semimartingale. Our setup allows for drift uncertainty in $X$ and model uncertainty for the local dynamics of $Y$. This work builds upon a recent paper of Kardaras & Robertson, where the authors consider an analogous problem, however, without the additional stochastic factor process. Under suitable, quite weak assumptions we are able to characterize the robust optimal trading strategy and the robust optimal growth rate. The optimal strategy is shown to be functionally generated and, remarkably, does not depend on the factor process $Y$.

Rescaling space and time, the limit of the trajectory of the diffusion process homogenizes over the periodic potential as well as over the internal degree of freedom.

We obtain closed form expressions for the VIX squared, exploiting the fact that the truncated signature of a polynomial diffusion is again a polynomial diffusion. Adding to such a primary process the Brownian motion driving the stock price, allows then to express both the log-price and the VIX squared as linear functions of the signature of the corresponding augmented process. This feature can then be efficiently used for pricing and calibration purposes. Indeed, as the signature samples can be easily precomputed, the calibration task can be split into an offline sampling and a standard optimization. We also propose a Fourier pricing approach for both VIX and SPX options exploiting that the signature of the augmented primary process is an infinite dimensional affine process. For both the SPX and VIX options we obtain highly accurate calibration results, showing that this model class allows to solve the joint calibration problem without adding jumps or rough volatility.",2023-01-30T19:03:01Z,2024-07-23T08:47:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13235v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13235v2,"q-fin.MF, math.PR, 91B70, 62P05, 65C20"

In the generalised classical facilitated exclusion process, which includes independent hopping of particles with rate $p$, our analytical and Monte-Carlo results establish emergence of a special density $\rho^*=1/3$ that demarcates two regimes in the steady state, based on the competition between two current carrying modes (facilitated and independent).

A neural network based model for multi-dimensional nonlinear Hawkes   processes,"Sobin Joseph, Shashi Jain","This paper introduces the Neural Network for Nonlinear Hawkes processes (NNNH), a non-parametric method based on neural networks to fit nonlinear Hawkes processes. Our method is suitable for analyzing large datasets in which events exhibit both mutually-exciting and inhibitive patterns. The NNNH approach models the individual kernels and the base intensity of the nonlinear Hawkes process using feed forward neural networks and jointly calibrates the parameters of the networks by maximizing the log-likelihood function. We utilize Stochastic Gradient Descent to search for the optimal parameters and propose an unbiased estimator for the gradient, as well as an efficient computation method. We demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of our method through numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world data, and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the NNNH method in accurately capturing the complexities of nonlinear Hawkes processes.",2023-03-06T12:31:19Z,2023-03-06T12:31:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03073v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03073v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, q-fin.ST"
"Periodic trawl processes: Simulation, statistical inference and   applications in energy markets",Almut E. D.

We derive some of the key probabilistic properties of periodic trawl processes and present relevant examples. Moreover, we show how such processes can be simulated and establish the asymptotic theory for their sample mean and sample autocovariances.

Model Predictive Control with Gaussian-Process-Supported Dynamical   Constraints for Autonomous Vehicles,"Johanna Bethge, Maik Pfefferkorn, Alexander Rose, Jan Peters, Rolf Findeisen","We propose a model predictive control approach for autonomous vehicles that exploits learned Gaussian processes for predicting human driving behavior. The proposed approach employs the uncertainty about the GP's prediction to achieve safety. A multi-mode predictive control approach considers the possible intentions of the human drivers. While the intentions are represented by different Gaussian processes, their probabilities foreseen in the observed behaviors are determined by a suitable online classification. Intentions below a certain probability threshold are neglected to improve performance. The proposed multi-mode model predictive control approach with Gaussian process regression support enables repeated feasibility and probabilistic constraint satisfaction with high probability. The approach is underlined in simulation, considering real-world measurements for training the Gaussian processes.",2023-03-08T17:14:57Z,2023-03-08T17:14:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04725v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04725v1,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.RO, cs.SY, math.OC"
Fast post-process Bayesian inference with Variational Sparse Bayesian   Quadrature,"Chengkun Li, Gr√©goire Clart√©, Martin J√∏rgensen, Luigi Acerbi","In applied Bayesian inference scenarios, users may have access to a large number of pre-existing model evaluations, for example from maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) optimization runs. However, traditional approximate inference techniques make little to no use of this available information. We propose the framework of post-process Bayesian inference as a means to obtain a quick posterior approximation from existing target density evaluations, with no further model calls. Within this framework, we introduce Variational Sparse Bayesian Quadrature (VSBQ), a method for post-process approximate inference for models with black-box and potentially noisy likelihoods. VSBQ reuses existing target density evaluations to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of the log posterior density function. Subsequently, we leverage sparse-GP Bayesian quadrature combined with variational inference to achieve fast approximate posterior inference over the surrogate. We validate our method on challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications from computational neuroscience. The experiments show that VSBQ builds high-quality posterior approximations by post-processing existing optimization traces, with no further model evaluations.",2023-03-09T13:58:35Z,2024-11-29T11:49:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05263v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05263v3,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.CO, stat.ME"
Bridging Deliberative Democracy and Deployment of Societal-Scale   Technology,Ned Cooper,"This position paper encourages the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community to focus on designing deliberative processes to inform and coordinate technology and policy design for large language models (LLMs) -- a `societal-scale technology'. First, I propose a definition for societal-scale technology and locate LLMs within this definition. Next, I argue that existing processes to ensure the safety of LLMs are insufficient and do not give the systems democratic legitimacy. Instead, we require processes of deliberation amongst users and other stakeholders on questions about the safety of outputs and deployment contexts. This shift in AI safety research and practice will require the design of corporate and public policies that determine how to enact deliberation and the design of interfaces and technical features to translate the outcomes of deliberation into technical development processes. To conclude, I propose roles for the HCI community to ensure deliberative processes inform technology and policy design for LLMs and other societal-scale technology.",2023-03-20T02:27:52Z,2023-03-27T04:47:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10831v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10831v2,"cs.CY, cs.HC, H.1.2; K.4.1"

In particular, we use the operator introduced by Scarpi in the Seventies and later reformulated in the regularized Caputo sense in Garrappa et al. (2021), inside the framework of the so-called general fractional calculus. The model obtained extends the well-known time-fractional Poisson process of fixed order $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and tries to overcome its limitation consisting in the constancy of the derivative order (and therefore of the memory degree of the interarrival times) with respect to time. The variable order renewal process is proved to fall outside the usual subordinated representation, since it can not be simply defined as a Poisson process with random time (as happens in the standard fractional case).

In the regime in which the gamma-like reversible measures of the particle systems are log-concave, our bounds match, yielding a version for the symmetric inclusion process of the celebrated Aldous' spectral gap conjecture originally formulated for the interchange process.

Such a process is called strongly stable if a random initialization exists, for which the process is stationary and ergodic, and for any other initialization, the difference between the two processes converges to zero almost surely. Under some mild conditions on the corresponding recursive map, without any condition on the driving sequence, we show the strong stability of iterations.

Addressing the self-interaction for ELDER dark matter from the 21-cm   signal,"Rupa Basu, Debasish Majumdar, Ashadul Halder, Shibaji Banerjee","The self-interacting dark matter can affect various cosmological processes. Such interactions can be number conserving (\emph{e.g.} $2 \rightarrow 2$) or number violating (\emph{e.g.} $3 \rightarrow 2,\,4 \rightarrow 2$ etc.). The latter processes where three (or more) dark matter particles undergo self-annihilation/scattering to produce less number of dark matter is termed as ``Cannibalism'' process. In this work, the self-interaction of dark matter and the strength of such interactions are investigated in the light of experimental results of the global 21-cm spectrum of neural hydrogen from the era of cosmic dawn. From the present work, it appears that $2\rightarrow 2$ process is much more dominant over the $3\rightarrow 2$ process.

This, however, typically requires fine-tuning the employed LM, which, among others, necessitates large amounts of suitable training data. A possible solution to this problem is the use of prompt engineering, which leverages pre-trained LMs without fine-tuning them.

Describing particle configurations in terms of size-biased and appropriately scaled empirical measures of mass distribution, we establish convergence in law of the inclusion process to a measure-valued Markov process on the space of probability measures. In the case where the diffusivity vanishes like the inverse of the system size, the derived scaling limit is equivalent to the well known Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, offering an alternative viewpoint on these well-established dynamics. Moreover, our approach covers all scaling regimes of the system parameters and yields a natural extension of the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion to infinite mutation rate.

Testing for jumps in processes with integral fractional part and   jump-robust inference on the Hurst exponent,"Markus Bibinger, Michael Sonntag","We develop and investigate a test for jumps based on high-frequency observations of a fractional process with an additive jump component. The Hurst exponent of the fractional process is unknown. The asymptotic theory under infill asymptotics builds upon extreme value theory for weakly dependent, stationary time series and extends techniques for the semimartingale case from the literature. It is shown that the statistic on which the test is based on weakly converges to a Gumbel distribution under the null hypothesis of no jumps. We prove consistency under the alternative hypothesis when there are jumps. Moreover, we establish convergence rates for local alternatives and consistent estimation of jump times. In the process, we show that inference on the Hurst exponent of a rough fractional process is robust with respect to jumps. This provides an important insight for the growing literature on rough volatility. We demonstrate sound finite-sample properties in a simulation study and showcase the applicability of our methods in an empirical example with a time series of volatilities.",2023-05-02T19:33:53Z,2024-05-13T16:18:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01751v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.01751v2,"math.ST, stat.TH, 60G22, 62M07, 60G70"

We propose a novel strategy to address this task when $x$ is a continuous-time signal: we adopt a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the source $x$, which allows for closed-form Bayesian nonparametric deconvolution. We first analyse the direct model to establish the conditions under which the model is well defined. Then, we turn to the inverse problem, where we study i) some necessary conditions under which Bayesian deconvolution is feasible, and ii) to which extent the filter $h$ can be learnt from data or approximated for the blind deconvolution case.

Model life extension for continuous process: Non-invasive correction of   model-plant mismatch with regularization,"Yohe Kono, Minoru Koizumi","In continuous process plants controlled by model predictive control, model-plant mismatch (MPM), due to the aging of processes, causes degradation of control performance. We propose a concept called Model Life Extension (MLE) and its implementation to mitigate this degradation in a non-invasive manner. The purpose of MLE is to continually update (re-identify) process models by using routine operating data on the assumption that the timescale of aging is much larger than the interval of excitation of reference signals. We implemented MLE by estimating MPM via $\mathcal{L}_1$ regularized regression and by finding an optimal regularization parameter via cross-validation and showed through numerical experiments that an optimal parameter can exist and be found by cross-validation for a pilot-scale distillation column. We then constructed the updated model based on the found parameter to demonstrate the possibility of correcting static-gain mismatch and transport-delay mismatch without injecting excitation signals to process inputs.",2023-05-12T08:45:09Z,2023-05-12T08:45:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07317v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07317v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, physics.data-an"

We first define a dimension destroying forward noising process, before deriving the dimension creating time-reversed generative process along with a novel evidence lower bound training objective for learning to approximate it. Simulating our learned approximation to the time-reversed generative process then provides an effective way of sampling data of varying dimensionality by jointly generating state values and dimensions. We demonstrate our approach on molecular and video datasets of varying dimensionality, reporting better compatibility with test-time diffusion guidance imputation tasks and improved interpolation capabilities versus fixed dimensional models that generate state values and dimensions separately.",2023-05-25T17:15:00Z,2023-10-30T10:14:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16261v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16261v2,"stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG"
Accelerating Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems through Shortcut   Sampling,"Gongye Liu, Haoze Sun, Jiayi Li, Fei Yin, Yujiu Yang","Diffusion models have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to address inverse problems in an unsupervised manner. While existing methods primarily focus on modifying the posterior sampling process, the potential of the forward process remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Shortcut Sampling for Diffusion(SSD), a novel approach for solving inverse problems in a zero-shot manner. Instead of initiating from random noise, the core concept of SSD is to find a specific transitional state that bridges the measurement image y and the restored image x. By utilizing the shortcut path of ""input - transitional state - output"", SSD can achieve precise restoration with fewer steps. To derive the transitional state during the forward process, we introduce Distortion Adaptive Inversion. Moreover, we apply back projection as additional consistency constraints during the generation process. Experimentally, we demonstrate SSD's effectiveness on multiple representative IR tasks. Our method achieves competitive results with only 30 NFEs compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot methods(100 NFEs) and outperforms them with 100 NFEs in certain tasks.

This work is motivated by problems arising in the control of symbolic music generation. We focus on infilling control tasks, whereby the controls are a subset of the events themselves, and conditional generation completes a sequence of events given the fixed control events. We train anticipatory infilling models using the large and diverse Lakh MIDI music dataset. These models match the performance of autoregressive models for prompted music generation, with the additional capability to perform infilling control tasks, including accompaniment.

Using analytic techniques, we characterize the probabilities and timescales of outcomes like absorption at zero (extinguishment) and the probability of the cumulative population (burned area) reaching a given size. The latter requires control over the embedded Markov chain: this discrete process is solved using the Pollazcek orthogonal polynomials, a deformation of the Gegenbauer/ultraspherical polynomials. This allows analysis of processes with bounded cumulative population, corresponding to finite burnable substrate in the wildfire interpretation, with probabilities represented as spectral integrals. This technology is developed in order to lay the foundations for a dynamic decision support framework.

The channel capacity of the ribosome,"Daniel A. Inafuku, Kay L. Kirkpatrick, Onyema Osuagwu, Qier An, David A. Brewster, Mayisha Zeb Nakib","Translation is one of the most fundamental processes in the biological cell. Because of the central role that translation plays across all domains of life, the enzyme that carries out this process, the ribosome, is required to process information with high accuracy. This accuracy often approaches values near unity experimentally. In this paper, we model the ribosome as an information channel and demonstrate mathematically that this biological machine has information-processing capabilities that have not been recognized previously. In particular, we calculate bounds on the ribosome's theoretical Shannon capacity and numerically approximate this capacity. Finally, by incorporating estimates on the ribosome's operation time, we show that the ribosome operates at speeds safely below its capacity, allowing the ribosome to process information with an arbitrary degree of error. Our results show that the ribosome achieves a high accuracy in line with purely information-theoretic means.",2023-07-27T15:19:14Z,2023-07-27T15:19:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14929v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14929v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.IT, math.IT"
Empirical Translation Process Research: Past and Possible Future   Perspectives,Michael Carl,"Over the past four decades, efforts have been made to develop and evaluate models for Empirical Translation Process Research (TPR), yet a comprehensive framework remains elusive. This article traces the evolution of empirical TPR within the CRITT TPR-DB tradition and proposes the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF) as a framework for modeling deeply embedded translation processes. It introduces novel approaches for quantifying fundamental concepts of Relevance Theory (relevance, s-mode, i-mode), and establishes their relation to the Monitor Model, framing relevance maximization as a special case of minimizing free energy. FEP/AIF provides a mathematically rigorous foundation that enables modeling of deep temporal architectures in which embedded translation processes unfold on different timelines. This framework opens up exciting prospects for future research in predictive TPR, likely to enrich our comprehension of human translation processes, and making valuable contributions to the wider realm of translation studies and the design of cognitive architectures.",2023-08-02T18:22:49Z,2023-08-02T18:22:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01368v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01368v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IT, math.IT"
An Improved Drift Theorem for Balanced Allocations,"Dimitrios Los, Thomas Sauerwald","In the balanced allocations framework, there are $m$ jobs (balls) to be allocated to $n$ servers (bins). The goal is to minimize the gap, the difference between the maximum and the average load.   Peres, Talwar and Wieder (RSA 2015) used the hyperbolic cosine potential function to analyze a large family of allocation processes including the $(1+\beta)$-process and graphical balanced allocations. The key ingredient was to prove that the potential drops in every step, i.e., a drift inequality.   In this work we improve the drift inequality so that (i) it is asymptotically tighter, (ii) it assumes weaker preconditions, (iii) it applies not only to processes allocating to more than one bin in a single step and (iv) to processes allocating a varying number of balls depending on the sampled bin. Our applications include the processes of (RSA 2015), but also several new processes, and we believe that our techniques may lead to further results in future work.",2023-08-21T23:35:23Z,2023-08-21T23:35:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11083v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11083v1,"math.PR, cs.DM, 68W20, 68W27, 68W40, 60C05, G.3; G.2.m; F.2.2"
"Advances in Self-Supervised Learning for Synthetic Aperture Sonar Data   Processing, Classification, and Pattern Recognition","Brandon Sheffield, Frank E. Bobe III, Bradley Marchand, Matthew S. Emigh","Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) imaging has become a crucial technology for underwater exploration because of its unique ability to maintain resolution at increasing ranges, a characteristic absent in conventional sonar techniques. However, the effective application of deep learning to SAS data processing is often limited due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes MoCo-SAS that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) for SAS data processing, classification, and pattern recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that MoCo-SAS significantly outperforms traditional supervised learning methods, as evidenced by significant improvements observed in terms of the F1-score.

Specifically, we extend a conformer encoder with trainable binary gates that allow us to dynamically skip network modules according to the input audio. Our approach improves detection and localization accuracy on continuous speech using Librispeech top-1000 most frequent words while maintaining a small memory footprint. The inclusion of gates also reduces the average amount of processing without affecting the overall performance. These benefits are shown to be even more pronounced using the Google speech commands dataset placed over background noise where up to 97% of the processing is skipped on non-speech inputs, therefore making our method particularly interesting for an always-on keyword spotter.",2023-08-31T21:25:57Z,2023-08-31T21:25:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00140v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00140v1,"cs.SD, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.AS"
Towards Efficient Modeling and Inference in Multi-Dimensional Gaussian   Process State-Space Models,"Zhidi Lin, Juan Maro√±as, Ying Li, Feng Yin, Sergios Theodoridis","The Gaussian process state-space model (GPSSM) has attracted extensive attention for modeling complex nonlinear dynamical systems. However, the existing GPSSM employs separate Gaussian processes (GPs) for each latent state dimension, leading to escalating computational complexity and parameter proliferation, thus posing challenges for modeling dynamical systems with high-dimensional latent states. To surmount this obstacle, we propose to integrate the efficient transformed Gaussian process (ETGP) into the GPSSM, which involves pushing a shared GP through multiple normalizing flows to efficiently model the transition function in high-dimensional latent state space. Additionally, we develop a corresponding variational inference algorithm that surpasses existing methods in terms of parameter count and computational complexity. Experimental results on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of the proposed method, while also demonstrating its ability to achieve similar inference performance compared to existing methods.

Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximations for Suprema of Empirical Processes,Alexander Giessing,"In this paper we develop non-asymptotic Gaussian approximation results for the sampling distribution of suprema of empirical processes when the indexing function class $\mathcal{F}_n$ varies with the sample size $n$ and may not be Donsker. Prior approximations of this type required upper bounds on the metric entropy of $\mathcal{F}_n$ and uniform lower bounds on the variance of $f \in \mathcal{F}_n$ which, both, limited their applicability to high-dimensional inference problems. In contrast, the results in this paper hold under simpler conditions on boundedness, continuity, and the strong variance of the approximating Gaussian process. The results are broadly applicable and yield a novel procedure for bootstrapping the distribution of empirical process suprema based on the truncated Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve decomposition of the approximating Gaussian process. We demonstrate the flexibility of this new bootstrap procedure by applying it to three fundamental problems in high-dimensional statistics: simultaneous inference on parameter vectors, inference on the spectral norm of covariance matrices, and construction of simultaneous confidence bands for functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.",2023-09-04T01:35:22Z,2023-09-04T01:35:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01307v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01307v1,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.ME, stat.TH, 62E20, 62F40"
Supervised Machine Learning and Physics based Machine Learning approach   for prediction of peak temperature distribution in Additive Friction Stir   Deposition of Aluminium Alloy,Akshansh Mishra,"Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) is a novel solid-state additive manufacturing technique that circumvents issues of porosity, cracking, and properties anisotropy that plague traditional powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition approaches. However, correlations between process parameters, thermal profiles, and resulting microstructure in AFSD remain poorly understood. This hinders process optimization for properties. This work employs a framework combining supervised machine learning (SML) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict peak temperature distribution in AFSD from process parameters. Eight regression algorithms were implemented for SML modeling, while four PINNs leveraged governing equations for transport, wave propagation, heat transfer, and quantum mechanics. Across multiple statistical measures, ensemble techniques like gradient boosting proved superior for SML, with lowest MSE of 165.78. The integrated ML approach was also applied to classify deposition quality from process factors, with logistic regression delivering robust accuracy. By fusing data-driven learning and fundamental physics, this dual methodology provides comprehensive insights into tailoring microstructure through thermal management in AFSD.

However, to further extract image information such as edge detection, conventional post-processing filtering operations are needed after the reconstruction of the original object images in the diffuser imaging systems. Here, we present the concept of a temporal compressive edge detection method based on a lensless diffuser camera, which can directly recover a time sequence of edge images of a moving object from a single-shot measurement, without further post-processing steps. Our approach provides higher image quality during edge detection, compared with the conventional post-processing method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by both numerical simulation and experiments.

Scalable Model-Based Gaussian Process Clustering,"Anirban Chakraborty, Abhisek Chakraborty","Gaussian process is an indispensable tool in clustering functional data, owing to it's flexibility and inherent uncertainty quantification.

To ensure scalability of Gaussian process clustering in such applications, we propose to embed the popular Vecchia approximation for Gaussian processes at the heart of the clustering task, provide crucial theoretical insights towards algorithmic design, and finally develop a computationally efficient expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.

Continuous Modeling of the Denoising Process for Speech Enhancement   Based on Deep Learning,"Zilu Guo, Jun Du, CHin-Hui Lee","In this paper, we explore a continuous modeling approach for deep-learning-based speech enhancement, focusing on the denoising process. We use a state variable to indicate the denoising process. The starting state is noisy speech and the ending state is clean speech. The noise component in the state variable decreases with the change of the state index until the noise component is 0. During training, a UNet-like neural network learns to estimate every state variable sampled from the continuous denoising process. In testing, we introduce a controlling factor as an embedding, ranging from zero to one, to the neural network, allowing us to control the level of noise reduction. This approach enables controllable speech enhancement and is adaptable to various application scenarios. Experimental results indicate that preserving a small amount of noise in the clean target benefits speech enhancement, as evidenced by improvements in both objective speech measures and automatic speech recognition performance.",2023-09-17T13:27:11Z,2024-01-07T15:52:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09270v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09270v2,"eess.AS, cs.AI, cs.SD"

We obtain an Integral Equation (IE) formulation for the corresponding PD as a function of the initial position of the asset value process and the time until maturity, from which we then prove that the PD function satisfies an appropriate Partial Integro-Differential Equation (PIDE). These representations allow us to show that appropriate weak (viscosity) as well as strong solutions exist, and develop subsequent numerical schemes for the estimation of the PD function. Such a framework is necessary under the newly introduced International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 regulation, which has imposed further requirements on the sophistication and rigor underlying credit modelling methodologies.

A Novel Quantum Visual Secret Sharing Scheme,"Wenjie Liu, Yinsong Xu, Maojun Zhang, Junxiu Chen, Ching-Nung Yang","Inspired by Naor et al.'s visual secret sharing (VSS) scheme, a novel n out of n quantum visual secret sharing (QVSS) scheme is proposed, which consists of two phases: sharing process and recovering process. In the first process, the color information of each pixel from the original secret image is encoded into an n-qubit superposition state by using the strategy of quantum expansion instead of classical pixel expansion, and then these n qubits are distributed as shares to n participants, respectively. During the recovering process, all participants cooperate to collect these n shares of each pixel together, then perform the corresponding measurement on them, and execute the n-qubit XOR operation to recover each pixel of the secret image. The proposed scheme has the advantage of single-pixel parallel processing that is not available in the existing analogous quantum schemes and perfectly solves the problem that in the classic VSS schemes the recovered image has the loss in resolution.

This framework integrates a neural network (NN) module into the closed-loop system during training with signals generated recursively on the fly to closely mimic the streaming process of acoustic howling suppression (AHS). The proposed recursive training strategy bridges the gap between training and real-world inference scenarios, marking a departure from previous NN-based methods that typically approach AHS as either noise suppression or acoustic echo cancellation. Within this framework, we explore two methodologies: one exclusively relying on NN and the other combining NN with the traditional Kalman filter. Additionally, we propose strategies, including howling detection and initialization using pre-trained offline models, to bolster trainability and expedite the training process.

Given $n$ data points, we prove the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance is $n^{-1/2}$ and the convergence rate in Kolmogorov distance is $n^{-1/2} \sqrt{\ln n}$.

Augmented Bridge Matching,"Valentin De Bortoli, Guan-Horng Liu, Tianrong Chen, Evangelos A.

One of the main aspect of their increased flexibility is that these models can interpolate between arbitrary data distributions i.e. they generalize beyond generative modeling and can be applied to learning stochastic (and deterministic) processes of arbitrary transfer tasks between two given distributions. In this paper, we highlight that while flow and bridge matching processes preserve the information of the marginal distributions, they do \emph{not} necessarily preserve the coupling information unless additional, stronger optimality conditions are met. This can be problematic if one aims at preserving the original empirical pairing. We show that a simple modification of the matching process recovers this coupling by augmenting the velocity field (or drift) with the information of the initial sample point. Doing so, we lose the Markovian property of the process but preserve the coupling information between distributions.

In the model, the data form a point process with observation times that have its intensity driven by a diffusion, with the associated marks also depending upon the diffusion process. We assume that one must resort to time-discretizing the diffusion process and develop particle and multilevel particle filters to recursively approximate the filter. In particular, we prove that our multilevel particle filter can achieve a mean square error (MSE) of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ ($\epsilon>0$ and arbitrary) with a cost of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ versus using a particle filter which has a cost of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to achieve the same MSE.

Propagation of chaos in path spaces via information theory,"Lei Li, Yuelin Wang, Yuliang Wang","Propagation of chaos for interacting particle systems has been an active research topic over decades. We propose an alternative approach to study the mean-field limit of the stochastic interacting particle systems via tools from information theory. In our framework, the propagation of chaos is reduced to the space for driving processes with possible lower dimension. Indeed, after applying the data processing inequality, one only needs to estimate the difference between the drifts of the particle system and the mean-field Mckean stochastic differential equation. This point is particularly useful in situations where the discrepancy in the driving processes is more apparent than the investigated processes. We will take the second order system as well as other examples for the illustration of how our framework could be used. This approach allows us to focus on probability measures in path spaces for the driving processes, avoiding using the usual hypocoercivity technique or taking the pseudo-inverse of the diffusion matrix, which might be more stable for numerical computation. Our framework is different from current approaches in literature and could provide new insight into the study of interacting particle systems.",2023-12-01T04:16:48Z,2025-01-04T01:51:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00339v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00339v3,"math.PR, cs.IT, math.IT"

While relational operators allow declarative and optimizable query specification, they are limited to data transformations unsuitable for capturing or analyzing context. On the other hand, representation learning models can map context-rich data into embeddings, allowing machine-automated context processing but requiring imperative data transformation integration with the analytical query. To bridge this dichotomy, we present a context-enhanced relational join and introduce an embedding operator composable with relational operators. This enables hybrid relational and context-rich vector data processing, with algebraic equivalences compatible with relational algebra and corresponding logical and physical optimizations. We investigate model-operator interaction with vector data processing and study the characteristics of the E-join operator. Using an example of string embeddings, we demonstrate enabling hybrid context-enhanced processing on relational join operators with vector embeddings.

This Markovian embedding uses a Laplace-convolution operation applied to the velocity trajectory. We introduce an asymptotic method tailored for this ME standard, generalising the system-size expansion for these jump processes. Under specific stability conditions tied to a single noise source, upon coarse-graining, the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) emerges as a universal approximate model for point processes in the weak-coupling limit.

However, since most automotive radars are likely to be mounted on vehicles and road infrastructure, road geometries are an important factor that must be considered. Instead of considering each road geometry as an individual case for study, in this work, we model each case as a specific instance of an underlying Poisson line process and further model the distribution of vehicles on the road as a Poisson point process - forming a Poisson line Cox process. Then, through the use of stochastic geometry tools, we estimate the average number of interfering radars for specific road and vehicular densities and the effect of radar parameters such as noise and beamwidth on the radar detection metrics.

Deep Internal Learning: Deep Learning from a Single Input,"Tom Tirer, Raja Giryes, Se Young Chun, Yonina C.

This is particularly relevant in many signal and image processing problems where training data is scarce and diversity is large on the one hand, and on the other, there is a lot of structure in the data that can be exploited. Using this information is the key to deep internal-learning strategies, which may involve training a network from scratch using a single input or adapting an already trained network to a provided input example at inference time. This survey paper aims at covering deep internal-learning techniques that have been proposed in the past few years for these two important directions. While our main focus will be on image processing problems, most of the approaches that we survey are derived for general signals (vectors with recurring patterns that can be distinguished from noise) and are therefore applicable to other modalities.",2023-12-12T16:48:53Z,2024-04-08T16:56:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07425v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07425v2,"cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.IV, eess.SP"
Efficient Time Discretization for Exploring Spatial Superconvergence of   Discontinuous Galerkin Methods,Xiaozhou Li,"We investigate two efficient time discretizations for the post-processing technique of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to solve hyperbolic conservation laws. The post-processing technique, which is applied at the final time of the DG method, can enhance the accuracy of the original DG solution (spatial superconvergence). One main difficulty of the post-processing technique is that the spatial superconvergence after post-processing needs to be matched with proper temporary accuracy. If the semi-discretized system (ODE system after spatial discretization) is under-resolved in time, then the space superconvergence will be concealed. In this paper, we focus our investigation on the recently designed SDG method and derive its explicit scheme from a correction process based on the DG weak formulation. We also introduce another similar technique, namely the spectral deferred correction (SDC) method. A comparison is made among both proposed time discretization techniques with the standard third-order Runge-Kutta method through several numerical examples, to conclude that both the SDG and SDC methods are efficient time discretization techniques for exploiting the spatial superconvergence of the DG methods.",2023-12-15T08:07:56Z,2023-12-21T11:07:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09592v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09592v2,"math.NA, cs.NA, 65L60, 65L05, 65M20"
"Relationship between Decimal Hill Coefficient, Intermediate Processes   and Mesoscopic Fluctuations","Manuel Eduardo Hern√°ndez-Garc√≠a, Jorge Vel√°zquez-Castro","The Hill function is relevant for describing enzyme binding and other processes in gene regulatory networks. Despite its theoretical foundation, it is often empirically used as a useful fitting function. Theoretical predictions suggest that the Hill coefficient should be an integer. However, it is often assigned a decimal value. The deterministic approximation of binding processes leads to the derivation of the Hill function, which can be expanded around the fluctuation magnitude to derive mesoscopic corrections. This study establishes the relationships between intermediate processes and the decimal Hill coefficient through a direct relationship between the dissociation constants, both with and without fluctuations. This outcome contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes associated with the decimal Hill coefficient while also enabling the prediction of an effective value of the Hill coefficient from the underlying mechanism. This procedure allows us to have a simplified effective description of complex systems.",2023-12-25T18:53:00Z,2024-09-03T18:16:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15789v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15789v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM, 92-11, G.3; I.6"
Accelerating Process Development for 3D Printing of New Metal Alloys,"David Guirguis, Conrad Tucker, Jack Beuth","Addressing the uncertainty and variability in the quality of 3D printed metals can further the wide spread use of this technology. Process mapping for new alloys is crucial for determining optimal process parameters that consistently produce acceptable printing quality. Process mapping is typically performed by conventional methods and is used for the design of experiments and ex situ characterization of printed parts. On the other hand, in situ approaches are limited because their observable features are limited and they require complex high-cost setups to obtain temperature measurements to boost accuracy. Our method relaxes these limitations by incorporating the temporal features of molten metal dynamics during laser-metal interactions using video vision transformers and high-speed imaging. Our approach can be used in existing commercial machines and can provide in situ process maps for efficient defect and variability quantification. The generalizability of the approach is demonstrated by performing cross-dataset evaluations on alloys with different compositions and intrinsic thermofluid properties.",2023-12-29T19:46:18Z,2023-12-29T19:46:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00065v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00065v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.CV, cs.LG, J.2"
Kairos: Efficient Temporal Graph Analytics on a Single Machine,"Joana M.

To date, however, most graph processing systems remain inefficient as they rely on distributed processing even for graphs that fit well within a commodity server's available storage. In this paper, we introduce Kairos, a temporal graph analytics system that provides application developers a framework for efficiently implementing and executing algorithms over temporal graphs on a single machine. Specifically, Kairos relies on fork-join parallelism and a highly optimized parallel data structure as core primitives to maximize performance of graph processing tasks needed for temporal graph analytics. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of selective indexing and show how it can be used with an efficient index to speedup temporal queries. Our experiments on a 24-core server show that our algorithms obtain good parallel speedups, and are significantly faster than equivalent algorithms in existing temporal graph processing systems: up to 60x against a shared-memory approach, and several orders of magnitude when compared with distributed processing of graphs that fit within a single server.",2024-01-04T22:31:47Z,2024-01-04T22:31:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02563v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02563v1,"cs.DB, cs.DC, cs.PF"
Information Flow Rate for Cross-Correlated Stochastic Processes,Dionissios T. Hristopulos,"Causal inference seeks to identify cause-and-effect interactions in coupled systems. A recently proposed method by Liang detects causal relations by quantifying the direction and magnitude of information flow between time series. The theoretical formulation of information flow for stochastic dynamical systems provides a general expression and a data-driven statistic for the rate of entropy transfer between different system units. To advance understanding of information flow rate in terms of intuitive concepts and physically meaningful parameters, we investigate statistical properties of the data-driven information flow rate between coupled stochastic processes. We derive relations between the expectation of the information flow rate statistic and properties of the auto- and cross-correlation functions. Thus, we elucidate the dependence of the information flow rate on the analytical properties and characteristic times of the correlation functions. Our analysis provides insight into the influence of the sampling step, the strength of cross-correlations, and the temporal delay of correlations on information flow rate.

Maintenance policy for a system with a weighted linear combination of   degradation processes,"Shaomin Wu, Inma T.

We assume that a number of defects may develop and the degradation process of each defect follows a gamma process, respectively. The system is inspected periodically and maintenance actions are performed on the defects present in the system. The effectiveness of the maintenance is assumed imperfect and it is modelled using a geometric process. By performing these maintenance actions, different costs are incurred depending on the type and the degradation levels of the defects. Furthermore, once a linear combination of the degradation processes exceeds a pre-specified threshold, the system needs a special maintenance and an extra cost is imposed. The system is renewed after several preventive maintenance activities have been performed. The main concern of this paper is to optimise the time between renewals and the number of renewals.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a machine learning technique that can optimize complex and nonlinear systems, including the processes in wastewater treatment plants, by learning control policies through trial and error. However, applying DRL to chemical and biological processes is challenging due to the need for accurate simulators. This study trained six models to identify the phosphorus removal process and used them to create a simulator for the DRL environment. Although the models achieved high accuracy (>97%), uncertainty and incorrect prediction behavior limited their performance as simulators over longer horizons. Compounding errors in the models' predictions were identified as one of the causes of this problem.

To define this graph, we therefore first introduce the partial correlation relation for continuous-time processes and provide several equivalent characterisations. In particular, we establish that the partial correlation relation defines a graphoid. The partial correlation graph additionally satisfies the usual Markov properties and the edges can be determined very easily via the inverse of the spectral density function. Throughout the paper, we compare and relate the partial correlation graph to the mixed (local) causality graph of Fasen-Hartmann and Schenk (2023a).

We propose a system that transforms the single channel under-determined SS task to an equivalent multichannel over-determined SS problem in a properly designed latent space. The separation task in the latent space is treated as finding a variational block-wise disentangled representation of the mixture. We show empirically, that the design choices and the variational formulation of the task at hand motivated by the classical signal processing theoretical results lead to robustness to unseen out-of-distribution data and reduction of the overfitting risk.

The root issue is that the design process of these methods is increasingly more implicit and indirect, and this process is also isolated from the native forward process (NFP), the ground-truth function that models the molecular dynamics. Following this insight, we propose TrustMol, an IMD method built to be trustworthy. For this purpose, TrustMol relies on a set of technical novelties including a new variational autoencoder network. Moreover, we propose a latent-property pairs acquisition method to effectively navigate the complexities of molecular latent optimization, a process that seems intuitive yet challenging due to the high-frequency and discontinuous nature of molecule space.

Identifying Potential Inlets of Man in the Artificial Intelligence   Development Process,"Deja Workman, Christopher L. Dancy","In this paper we hope to identify how the typical or standard artificial intelligence development process encourages or facilitates the creation of racialized technologies. We begin by understanding Sylvia Wynter's definition of the biocentric Man genre and its exclusion of Blackness from humanness. We follow this with outlining what we consider to be the typical steps for developing an AI-based technology, which we have broken down into 6 stages: identifying a problem, development process and management tool selection, dataset development and data processing, model development, deployment and risk assessment, and integration and monitoring. The goal of this paper is to better understand how Wynter's biocentric Man is being represented and reinforced by the technologies we are producing in the AI lifecycle and by the lifecycle itself; we hope to identify ways in which the distinction of Blackness from the ""ideal"" human leads to perpetual punishment at the hands of these technologies. By deconstructing this development process, we can potentially identify ways in which humans in general have not been prioritized and how those affects are disproportionately affecting marginalized people. We hope to offer solutions that will encourage changes in the AI development cycle.",2024-02-27T16:52:18Z,2024-02-27T16:52:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14658v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14658v1,"cs.CY, cs.AI, I.2.0; K.4.2"
A Markov approach to credit rating migration conditional on economic   states,"Michael Kalkbrener, Natalie Packham","We develop a model for credit rating migration that accounts for the impact of economic state fluctuations on default probabilities. The joint process for the economic state and the rating is modelled as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. While the rating process itself possesses the Markov property only under restrictive conditions, methods from Markov theory can be used to derive the rating process' asymptotic behaviour. We use the mathematical framework to formalise and analyse different rating philosophies, such as point-in-time (PIT) and through-the-cycle (TTC) ratings. Furthermore, we introduce stochastic orders on the bivariate process' transition matrix to establish a consistent notion of ""better"" and ""worse"" ratings. Finally, the construction of PIT and TTC ratings is illustrated on a Merton-type firm-value process.",2024-03-21T22:29:48Z,2024-03-21T22:29:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14868v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14868v1,"q-fin.RM, math.PR, 60J20, 91G40, 60J05, 60E15"
Extremal properties of max-autoregressive moving average processes for   modelling extreme river flows,"Eleanor D'Arcy, Jonathan A Tawn","Max-autogressive moving average (Max-ARMA) processes are powerful tools for modelling time series data with heavy-tailed behaviour; these are a non-linear version of the popular autoregressive moving average models. River flow data typically have features of heavy tails and non-linearity, as large precipitation events cause sudden spikes in the data that then exponentially decay. Therefore, stationary Max-ARMA models are a suitable candidate for capturing the unique temporal dependence structure exhibited by river flows. This paper contributes to advancing our understanding of the extremal properties of stationary Max-ARMA processes. We detail the first approach for deriving the extremal index, the lagged asymptotic dependence coefficient, and an efficient simulation for a general Max-ARMA process. We use the extremal properties, coupled with the belief that Max-ARMA processes provide only an approximation to extreme river flow, to fit such a model which can broadly capture river flow behaviour over a high threshold. We make our inference under a reparametrisation which gives a simpler parameter space that excludes cases where any parameter is non-identifiable. We illustrate results for river flow data from the UK River Thames.",2024-03-25T10:03:46Z,2024-03-25T10:03:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16590v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16590v1,"stat.ME, math.ST, stat.AP, stat.TH"
SIS epidemics on open networks: A replacement-based approximation,"Renato Vizuete, Paolo Frasca, Elena Panteley","In this paper we analyze continuous-time SIS epidemics subject to arrivals and departures of agents, by using an approximated process based on replacements. In defining the SIS dynamics in an open network, we consider a stochastic setting in which arrivals and departures take place according to Poisson processes with similar rates, and the new value of the infection probability of an arriving agent is drawn from a continuous distribution. Since the system size changes with time, we define an approximated process, in which replacements take place instead of arrivals and departures, and we focus on the evolution of an aggregate measure of the level of infection. So long as the reproduction number is less than one, the long-term behavior of this function measures the impact of the changes of the set of agents in the epidemic. We derive upper bounds for the expectation and variance of this function and we include a numerical example to show that the approximated process is close to the original SIS process.",2024-03-25T13:01:29Z,2024-03-25T13:01:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16727v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16727v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.OC, math.PR"
Enhancing Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy via Quantum Annealing,Yasuyuki Ihara,"Multiple object tracking (MOT), a key task in image recognition, presents a persistent challenge in balancing processing speed and tracking accuracy.

A method to improve the matching integration process is also proposed. By utilizing the sequential nature of MOT, this study further augments the tracking method via reverse annealing (RA). Experimental validation confirms the maintenance of high accuracy with an annealing time of a mere 3 $\mu$s per tracking process.

Cell Escape Probabilities for Markov Processes on a Grid,"Toon Ingelaere, Vince Maes, Giovanni Samaey","Kinetic equations describe physical processes in a high-dimensional phase space and are often simulated using Markov process-based Monte Carlo routines. The quantities of interest are typically defined on the lower-dimensional position space and estimated on a grid (histogram). In several applications, such as the construction of diffusion Monte Carlo-like techniques and variance prediction for particle tracing Monte Carlo methods, the cell escape probabilities, i.e., the probabilities with which particles escape a grid cell during one step of the Markov process, are of interest. In this paper, we derive formulas to calculate the cell escape probabilities for common mesh elements in one, two, and three dimensions. Deterministic calculation of cell escape probabilities in higher dimensions becomes expensive and prone to quadrature errors due to the involved high-dimensional integrals. We therefore also introduce a stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the escape probabilities, which is more robust at the cost of a statistical error.

Concentration and central limit theorem for the averaging process on   $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$,Austin Eide,"In the averaging process on a graph $G = (V, E)$, a random mass distribution $\eta$ on $V$ is repeatedly updated via transformations of the form $\eta_{v}, \eta_{w} \mapsto (\eta_{v} + \eta_{w})/2$, with updates made according to independent Poisson clocks associated to the edge set $E$. We study the averaging process when $G$ is the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. We prove that the process has tight asymptotic concentration around its mean in the $\ell^{1}$ and $\ell^{2}$ norms and use this to prove a central limit theorem. Previous work by Nagahata and Yoshida implies the central limit theorem when $d \geq 3$. Our results extend this to hold for all $d \geq 1$, and our techniques are likely applicable to other processes for which previously only the $d \geq 3$ case was tractable.",2024-04-02T22:52:49Z,2024-04-02T22:52:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02351v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02351v1,"math.PR, math.CO, 60K35"

We introduce a novel application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to dimensionality reduction, a method previously underexploited in this context. By demonstrating its utility across various AI domains, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and image processing, this FFT-based approach promises to improve data retrieval processes and enhance the efficiency and scalability of AI solutions. The incorporation of FFT may not only optimize operations in real-time processing and recommendation systems but also extend to advanced image processing techniques, where dimensionality reduction can significantly improve performance and analysis efficiency. This paper advocates for the broader adoption of FFT in vector database management, marking a significant stride towards addressing the challenges of data volume and complexity in AI research and applications.

We further develop a matrix product operator algorithm to learn probabilistic sequence-to-sequence processes and apply this algorithm to probabilistic cellular automata. This new approach can accurately learn probabilistic cellular automata processes in different conditions, even when the process is a probabilistic mixture of different chaotic rules.

Neural Flow Diffusion Models: Learnable Forward Process for Improved   Diffusion Modelling,"Grigory Bartosh, Dmitry Vetrov, Christian A.

This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories, and demonstrate how the framework may be adopted for learning bridges between two distributions.

Recent advances have shown how to use random feature approximations to achieve scalable, online ensembling of Gaussian processes with desirable theoretical properties and fruitful applications. One key to these methods' success is the inclusion of a random walk on the model parameters, which makes models dynamic. We show that these methods can be generalized easily to any basis expansion model and that using alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, often results in better performance. To simplify the process of choosing a specific basis expansion, our method's generality also allows the ensembling of several entirely different models, for example, a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Finally, we propose a novel method to ensemble static and dynamic models together.",2024-05-02T15:09:59Z,2024-05-02T15:09:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01365v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01365v1,"cs.LG, eess.SP, stat.ML"

The system monitors a two-state Markovian source that characterizes a stochastic process, which can be in either a normal state or an alarm state, with a higher demand for fresh updates when the source is in the alarm state. We propose a metric to capture the freshness of status updates for each state of the stochastic process by introducing two Age of Information (AoI) variables, extending the definition of AoI to account for the state changes of the stochastic process. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), utilizing a transition cost function that applies linear and non-linear penalties based on AoI and the state of the stochastic process. Through analytical investigation, we delve into the structure of the optimal transmission policy for the resulting MDP problem.

Under natural, weak smoothness assumptions on the underlying copula, it is shown that Stute's representation is valid in the following sense: all low-dimensional margins of fixed dimension of the empirical copula process can be approximated by a functional of the low-dimensional margins of the standard empirical process, with the almost sure error term being uniform in the margins. The result has numerous potential applications, and is exemplary applied to the problem of testing pairwise stochastic independence in high dimensions, leading to various extensions of recent results in the literature: for certain test statistics based on pairwise association measures, type-I error control is obtained for models beyond mutual independence. Moreover, bootstrap-based critical values are shown to yield strong control of the familywise error rate for a large class of data generating processes.",2024-05-09T07:37:37Z,2024-05-09T07:37:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05597v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, Primary 62G20, 62H05, secondary 62G09"

However, this idea has not yet been linked with formal theories of computation under resource constraints. Here we use information theory to formulate a model of language comprehension as an optimal trade-off between accuracy and processing depth, formalized as bits of information extracted from the input, which increases with processing time. The model provides a measure of processing effort as the change in processing depth, which we link to EEG signals and reading times. We validate our theory against a large-scale dataset of garden path sentence reading times, and EEG experiments featuring N400, P600 and biphasic ERP effects.

We show that the reachability and safety problem of this game reduce to the analysis of single-process (non-concurrent) programs. In particular, they exhibit only finite-state behaviour.

Representation and De-interleaving of Mixtures of Hidden Markov   Processes,"Jiadi Bao, Mengtao Zhu, Yunjie Li, Shafei Wang","De-interleaving of the mixtures of Hidden Markov Processes (HMPs) generally depends on its representation model. Existing representation models consider Markov chain mixtures rather than hidden Markov, resulting in the lack of robustness to non-ideal situations such as observation noise or missing observations. Besides, de-interleaving methods utilize a search-based strategy, which is time-consuming. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel representation model and corresponding de-interleaving methods for the mixtures of HMPs. At first, a generative model for representing the mixtures of HMPs is designed. Subsequently, the de-interleaving process is formulated as a posterior inference for the generative model. Secondly, an exact inference method is developed to maximize the likelihood of the complete data, and two approximate inference methods are developed to maximize the evidence lower bound by creating tractable structures. Then, a theoretical error probability lower bound is derived using the likelihood ratio test, and the algorithms are shown to get reasonably close to the bound.

While the subject is relatively well understood and appropriate modifications have been suggested in the context of multi-scale diffusion processes and their reduced model equations, we consider here an alternative setting where a second-order diffusion process in positions and velocities is only observed via its positions. In this note, we propose a simple modification to standard stochastic gradient descent and Kalman filter formulations, which eliminates the arising systematic estimation biases. The modification can be extended to standard maximum likelihood approaches and avoids computation of previously proposed correction terms.",2024-06-20T21:06:40Z,2024-06-20T21:06:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14738v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14738v1,"stat.ME, cs.NA, math.NA, math.ST, stat.TH, 65C30, 65L09, 60M20, 62F10, 62F15, 62L20"
Unmixing Noise from Hawkes Process to Model Learned Physiological Events,"Guillaume Staerman, Virginie Loison, Thomas Moreau","Physiological signal analysis often involves identifying events crucial to understanding biological dynamics. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted procedures or supervised learning, presenting challenges such as expert dependence, lack of robustness, and the need for extensive labeled data. Data-driven methods like Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offer an alternative but tend to produce spurious detections. This work introduces UNHaP (Unmix Noise from Hawkes Processes), a novel approach addressing the joint learning of temporal structures in events and the removal of spurious detections. Leveraging marked Hawkes processes, UNHaP distinguishes between events of interest and spurious ones. By treating the event detection output as a mixture of structured and unstructured events, UNHaP efficiently unmixes these processes and estimates their parameters. This approach significantly enhances the understanding of event distributions while minimizing false detection rates.",2024-06-17T09:57:48Z,2024-06-17T09:57:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16938v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16938v1,"eess.SP, cs.LG, stat.ML"
Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes,"Lucas S√°, Pedro Ribeiro, Toma≈æ Prosen, Denis Bernard","We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.",2024-06-25T22:12:22Z,2024-06-25T22:12:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17955v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17955v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.dis-nn, math-ph, math.MP"
Gaunt coefficients for complex and real spherical harmonics with   applications to spherical array processing and Ambisonics,Archontis Politis,"Acoustical signal processing of directional representations of sound fields, including source, receiver, and scatterer transfer functions, are often expressed and modeled in the spherical harmonic domain (SHD). Certain such modeling operations, or applications of those models, involve multiplications of those directional quantities, which can also be expressed conveniently in the SHD through coupling coefficients known as Gaunt coefficients. Since the definition and notation of Gaunt coefficients varies across acoustical publications, this work defines them based on established conventions of complex and real spherical harmonics (SHs) along with a convenient matrix form for spherical multiplication of directionally band-limited spherical functions. Additionally, the report provides a derivation of the Gaunt coefficients for real SHs, which has been missing from the literature and can be used directly in spatial audio frameworks such as Ambisonics. Matlab code is provided that can compute all coefficients up to user specified SH orders.

We advocate a two-stage framework for picturing SDHEPs based on the separation of scales, which gives a clear description both kinematically and dynamically. We examine the sensitivity of the SDHEP to the parton momentum fraction $x$-dependence of GPDs, and demonstrate it quantitatively with two specific processes that can be readily measured at J-PARC or AMBER using a pion beam and at JLab using a photon beam, respectively.

Additionally, GraphMuse integrates hierarchical modeling elements that augment the expressivity and capabilities of graph networks for musical tasks.

We present a general-purpose post-processing algorithm that, using accurate estimates of the regression function and a sensitive attribute predictor, generates predictions that meet the demographic parity constraint. Our method involves discretization and stochastic minimization of a smooth convex function. It is suitable for online post-processing and multi-class classification tasks only involving unlabeled data for the post-processing. Unlike prior methods, our approach is fully theory-driven. We require precise control over the gradient norm of the convex function, and thus, we rely on more advanced techniques than standard stochastic gradient descent.

Estimating the hyperuniformity exponent of point processes,"Gabriel Mastrilli, Bart≈Çomiej B≈Çaszczyszyn, Fr√©d√©ric Lavancier","We address the challenge of estimating the hyperuniformity exponent $\alpha$ of a spatial point process, given only one realization of it. Assuming that the structure factor $S$ of the point process follows a vanishing power law at the origin (the typical case of a hyperuniform point process), this exponent is defined as the slope near the origin of $\log S$. Our estimator is built upon the (expanding window) asymptotic variance of some wavelet transforms of the point process. By combining several scales and several wavelets, we develop a multi-scale, multi-taper estimator $\widehat{\alpha}$. We analyze its asymptotic behavior, proving its consistency under various settings, and enabling the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals for $\alpha$ when $\alpha < d$ and under Brillinger mixing. This construction is derived from a multivariate central limit theorem where the normalisations are non-standard and vary among the components. We also present a non-asymptotic deviation inequality providing insights into the influence of tapers on the bias-variance trade-off of $\widehat{\alpha}$. Finally, we investigate the performance of $\widehat{\alpha}$ through simulations, and we apply our method to the analysis of hyperuniformity in a real dataset of marine algae.",2024-07-23T18:53:56Z,2024-07-23T18:53:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16797v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16797v1,"math.ST, math.PR, stat.ME, stat.TH, Primary: 62M15, 62M30, secondary: 62F12, 60F05, 60G55"
Neural Term Structure of Additive Process for Option Pricing,"Jimin Lin, Guixin Liu","The additive process generalizes the L\'evy process by relaxing its assumption of time-homogeneous increments and hence covers a larger family of stochastic processes. Recent research in option pricing shows that modeling the underlying log price with an additive process has advantages in easier construction of the risk-neural measure, an explicit option pricing formula and characteristic function, and more flexibility to fit the implied volatility surface. Still, the challenge of calibrating an additive model arises from its time-dependent parameterization, for which one has to prescribe parametric functions for the term structure. For this, we propose the neural term structure model to utilize feedforward neural networks to represent the term structure, which alleviates the difficulty of designing parametric functions and thus attenuates the misspecification risk. Numerical studies with S\&P 500 option data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the neural term structure.",2024-08-03T03:00:50Z,2024-10-01T20:15:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01642v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01642v2,"q-fin.CP, q-fin.MF, q-fin.PR, stat.ML"
Dancing with invisible partners: Three-body exchanges with primordial   black holes,"Badal Bhalla, Benjamin V. Lehmann, Kuver Sinha, Tao Xu","The abundance of massive primordial black holes has historically been constrained by dynamical probes. Since these objects can participate in hard few-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar systems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is not the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black holes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a binary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case, the remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an invisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial black holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for detecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the Solar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary systems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary evolution.",2024-08-08T18:00:03Z,2025-02-12T19:30:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04697v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04697v2,"hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc"
Unraveling Text Generation in LLMs: A Stochastic Differential Equation   Approach,Yukun Zhang,"This paper explores the application of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to interpret the text generation process of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Text generation in LLMs is modeled as a stochastic process where each step depends on previously generated content and model parameters, sampling the next word from a vocabulary distribution. We represent this generation process using SDE to capture both deterministic trends and stochastic perturbations. The drift term describes the deterministic trends in the generation process, while the diffusion term captures the stochastic variations. We fit these functions using neural networks and validate the model on real-world text corpora. Through numerical simulations and comprehensive analyses, including drift and diffusion analysis, stochastic process property evaluation, and phase space exploration, we provide deep insights into the dynamics of text generation. This approach not only enhances the understanding of the inner workings of LLMs but also offers a novel mathematical perspective on language generation, which is crucial for diagnosing, optimizing, and controlling the quality of generated text.",2024-08-17T15:30:27Z,2024-08-17T15:30:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11863v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11863v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL"

Though the potential ability of optical fiber was demonstrated via the establishing of fiber neural networks, it will be of great significance of combining both fiber transmission and computing functions so as to cater the needs of future beyond 5G intelligent communication signal processing. Thus, in this letter, the fiber neural networks and their related optical signal processing methods will be both developed. In this way, information derived from the transmitted signals can be directly processed in the optical domain rather than being converted to the electronic domain. As a result, both prominent gains in processing efficiency and power cost can be further obtained.

LAST: Language Model Aware Speech Tokenization,"Arnon Turetzky, Yossi Adi","Speech tokenization serves as the foundation of speech language model (LM), enabling them to perform various tasks such as spoken language modeling, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, etc. Most speech tokenizers are trained independently of the LM training process, relying on separate acoustic models and quantization methods. Following such an approach may create a mismatch between the tokenization process and its usage afterward. In this study, we propose a novel approach to training a speech tokenizer by leveraging objectives from pre-trained textual LMs. We advocate for the integration of this objective into the process of learning discrete speech representations. Our aim is to transform features from a pre-trained speech model into a new feature space that enables better clustering for speech LMs. We empirically investigate the impact of various model design choices, including speech vocabulary size and text LM size. Our results demonstrate the proposed tokenization method outperforms the evaluated baselines considering both spoken language modeling and speech-to-text.

This allows us to arrive at an expressive and explainable model that is easily trained on modest amounts of data.

Bayesian aggregate fault index and block fault indices vs. time pinpoint origins of the fault.

This paper addresses the challenge of integrating a debiasing phase into predictive business process analytics to ensure that predictions are not influenced by biased variables. Our framework leverages on adversial debiasing is evaluated on four case studies, showing a significant reduction in the contribution of biased variables to the predicted value.

We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ODE inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",2024-10-10T00:33:25Z,2024-10-10T00:33:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07501v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07501v1,"cs.LG, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"

In contrast, DEMO offers a theoretically robust, ontology-driven framework that focuses on abstracting the essential structure of business processes. A novel approach combining the rigor of DEMO's transaction patterns with the more practical, widely adopted BPMN framework is proposed and demonstrated.

Roles of LLMs in the Overall Mental Architecture,Ron Sun,"To better understand existing LLMs, we may examine the human mental (cognitive/psychological) architecture, and its components and structures. Based on psychological, philosophical, and cognitive science literatures, it is argued that, within the human mental architecture, existing LLMs correspond well with implicit mental processes (intuition, instinct, and so on). However, beyond such implicit processes, explicit processes (with better symbolic capabilities) are also present within the human mental architecture, judging from psychological, philosophical, and cognitive science literatures. Various theoretical and empirical issues and questions in this regard are explored. Furthermore, it is argued that existing dual-process computational cognitive architectures (models of the human cognitive/psychological architecture) provide usable frameworks for fundamentally enhancing LLMs by introducing dual processes (both implicit and explicit) and, in the meantime, can also be enhanced by LLMs. The results are synergistic combinations (in several different senses simultaneously).",2024-10-26T01:13:44Z,2024-10-26T01:13:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20037v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20037v1,"q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.CY"

We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.",2024-10-28T16:57:02Z,2024-10-28T16:57:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21212v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21212v1,"hep-lat, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.LG"
Relaxation dynamics of poly(ethylene oxide),"Peter Lunkenheimer, Alois Loidl","Poly(ethylene oxide) is an important polymer with many applications, e.g., as solid-state electrolyte in batteries. Its relaxation dynamics, characterizing its molecular and submolecular motions, which is relevant for many of these applications, was investigated numerous times, mostly employing dielectric spectroscopy. However, the various dynamic processes revealed by these studies were interpreted in conflicting ways and even their nomenclature in literature is highly inconsistent. Here we present the results of a detailed investigation of this polymer employing dielectric spectroscopy covering a relatively broad frequency and temperature range. We clearly detect four intrinsic relaxation processes. The slowest one most likely represents a so-called normal mode, reflecting global motions of the polymer chains, an interpretation that was not considered in previous works. The second process can be unequivocally identified with the segmental alpha relaxation, which governs glassy freezing and the glass transition. The third, only rarely detected process corresponds to the Johari-Goldstein relaxation of poly(ethylene oxide), widely overlooked in previous studies. The fourth and fastest process is unrelated to the supercooled and glassy state of this polymer and probably due to local, intramolecular motions.",2024-11-12T14:01:19Z,2024-11-12T14:01:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07807v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07807v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.chem-ph"
Data Processing Efficiency Aware User Association and Resource   Allocation in Blockchain Enabled Metaverse over Wireless Communications,"Liangxin Qian, Jun Zhao","In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Metaverse, enhanced by blockchain technology, the efficient processing of data has emerged as a critical challenge, especially in wireless communication systems. Addressing this need, our paper introduces the innovative concept of data processing efficiency (DPE), aiming to maximize processed bits per unit of resource consumption in blockchain-empowered Metaverse environments. To achieve this, we propose the DPE-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation (DAUR) algorithm, a tailored solution for these complex systems.

Shortest Path Lengths in Poisson Line Cox Processes: Approximations and   Applications,"Gourab Ghatak, Sanjoy Kumar Jhawar, Martin Haenggi","We derive exact expressions for the shortest path length to a point of a Poisson line Cox process (PLCP) from the typical point of the PLCP and from the typical intersection of the underlying Poisson line process (PLP), restricted to a single turn. For the two turns case, we derive a bound on the shortest path length from the typical point and demonstrate conditions under which the bound is tight. We also highlight the line process and point process densities for which the shortest path from the typical intersection under the one turn restriction may be shorter than the shortest path from the typical point under the two turns restriction.

The Promise and Peril of Generative AI: Evidence from GPT-4 as Sell-Side   Analysts,"Edward Li, Zhiyuan Tu, Dexin Zhou","We investigate how advanced large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, process corporate disclosures to forecast earnings. Using earnings press releases issued around GPT-4's knowledge cutoff date, we address two questions: (1) Do GPT-generated earnings forecasts outperform analysts in accuracy? (2) How is GPT's performance related to its processing of textual and quantitative information? Our findings suggest that GPT forecasts are significantly less accurate than those of analysts. This underperformance can be traced to GPT's distinct textual and quantitative approaches: its textual processing follows a consistent, generalized pattern across firms, highlighting its strengths in language tasks. In contrast, its quantitative processing capabilities vary significantly across firms, revealing limitations tied to the uneven availability of domain-specific training data. Additionally, there is some evidence that GPT's forecast accuracy diminishes beyond its knowledge cutoff, underscoring the need to evaluate LLMs under hindsight-free conditions. Overall, this study provides a novel exploration of the ""black box"" of GPT-4's information processing, offering insights into LLMs' potential and challenges in financial applications.",2024-12-02T03:08:18Z,2024-12-02T03:08:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01069v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01069v1,"q-fin.GN, econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
"Causality for VARMA processes with instantaneous effects: The global   Markov property, faithfulness and instrumental variables",Ignacio Gonz√°lez-P√©rez,"Causal reasoning has gained great attention over the last half century as it allows (or at least intends) to answer questions which go above those within the capabilities of classical inferential statistics using just observational data. So far, causal research has been focused mostly on the i.i.d. setting. However, many are the situations where there exists a non-trivial dependence structure between sequential observations. Motivated by this fact, the main purpose of this work is to study causal properties of time series under the structural assumption of a VARMA model with instantaneous effects. First, the global Markov property is studied, building on existing work for VAR processes without instantaneous effects. Infinite graphs which represent the dependencies of the process are defined so that separation statements translate to conditional independencies in the stationary distribution of the process. Second, faithfulness is examined as a counterpart of this Markov property. Conditions are given so that the stationary distribution of the process is almost surely faithful to said infinite graphs. In addition, an instrumental variable regression framework is developed for VARMA models with instantaneous effects. This allows to identify and consistently estimate total causal effects.",2025-01-22T17:36:03Z,2025-01-22T17:36:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13037v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13037v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62A99"
On the Singular Control of a Diffusion and Its Running Infimum or   Supremum,"Giorgio Ferrari, Neofytos Rodosthenous","We study a class of singular stochastic control problems for a one-dimensional diffusion $X$ in which the performance criterion to be optimised depends explicitly on the running infimum $I$ (or supremum $S$) of the controlled process. We introduce two novel integral operators that are consistent with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the resulting two-dimensional singular control problems. The first operator involves integrals where the integrator is the control process of the two-dimensional process $(X,I)$ or $(X,S)$; the second operator concerns integrals where the integrator is the running infimum or supremum process itself. Using these definitions, we prove a general verification theorem for problems involving two-dimensional state-dependent running costs, costs of controlling the process, costs of increasing the running infimum (or supremum) and exit times. Finally, we apply our results to explicitly solve an optimal dividend problem in which the manager's time-preferences depend on the company's historical worst performance.",2025-01-29T11:29:39Z,2025-01-29T11:29:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17577v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17577v1,"math.OC, math.PR, q-fin.MF, 93E20, 60J60, 49L12, 91B70"
BoT: Breaking Long Thought Processes of o1-like Large Language Models   through Backdoor Attack,"Zihao Zhu, Hongbao Zhang, Mingda Zhang, Ruotong Wang, Guanzong Wu, Ke Xu, Baoyuan Wu","Longer thought, better performance: large language models with deep reasoning capabilities, particularly o1-like models, have demonstrated remarkable performance by generating extensive thought processes during inference. This trade-off reveals a potential vulnerability: adversaries could compromise model performance by forcing immediate responses without thought processes. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel attack scenario targeting the long thought processes of o1-like models and propose BoT (Break CoT), which can selectively break intrinsic reasoning mechanisms through backdoor attacks. BoT constructs poisoned datasets with designed triggers and injects backdoor by either supervised fine-tuning or direct preference optimization. When triggered, the model directly generates answers without thought processes, while maintaining normal reasoning capabilities for clean inputs. Extensive experiments on open-source o1-like models, including recent DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that BoT nearly achieves high attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy, highlighting the critical safety risk in current models. Furthermore, the relationship between task difficulty and helpfulness reveals a potential application for good, enabling users to customize model behavior based on task complexity.

Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors,"Peter O'Donovan, Neil Dowling, Kavan Modi, Mark T. Mitchison","The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions and is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process tensor in a given basis of local interventions, and use it to define increasingly more fine-grained probes of quantum chaos. The first moment of this ensemble encapsulates numerous previously studied chaos quantifiers, including the Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical entropy, butterfly flutter fidelity, and spatiotemporal entanglement. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies. These conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations of many-body dynamics for a range of spin-chain models, including non-interacting, interacting-integrable, chaotic, and many-body localized regimes. Our work elucidates the fingerprints of chaos on spatiotemporal correlations in quantum stochastic processes, and provides a unified framework for analyzing the complexity of unitary and monitored many-body dynamics.",2025-02-19T18:06:07Z,2025-02-19T18:06:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13930v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13930v1,"quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, nlin.CD"
Spectrum of L√©vy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$,Rohan Sarkar,"We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent on the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.",2025-02-21T03:34:36Z,2025-02-21T03:34:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15183v1,"math.PR, math.AP, math.FA, math.SP, 35P05"

We clarify the mechanism for this power-law behavior of moments by treating a simple Langevin-type model both approximately and exactly, and argue this mechanism is universal.

Thus, since exponential distributions complement Poisson point processes, we obtain a means to discuss the neighbourhood of independence for random processes.",2003-11-06T18:19:51Z,2003-11-06T18:19:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311087v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0311087v1,"math.DG, math.PR, 53B20; 60G05"
