BER Performance of Spatial Modulation Systems Under a Non-Stationary   Massive MIMO Channel Model,"Yu Fu, Cheng-Xiang Wang, Xuming Fang, Li Yan, Stephen McLaughlin","In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) performance of spatial modulation (SM) systems is investigated both theoretically and by simulation in a non-stationary Kronecker-based massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel model in multi-user (MU) scenarios. Massive MIMO SM systems are considered in this paper using both a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and a block diagonalization (BD) based precoding scheme, for different system settings. Their performance is compared with a vertical Bell labs layered space-time (V-BLAST) architecture based system and a conventional channel inversion system. It is observed that a higher cluster evolution factor can result in better BER performance of SM systems due to the low correlation among sub-channels. Compared with the BD-SM system, the SM system using the TDMA scheme obtains a better BER performance but with a much lower total system data rate. The BD-MU-SM system achieves the best trade-off between the data rate and the BER performance among all of the systems considered. When compared with the V-BLAST system and the channel inversion system, SM approaches offer advantages in performance for MU massive MIMO systems.",2020-07-28T07:15:17Z,2020-07-28T07:15:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14027v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14027v1,eess.SP
The multi-layer network nature of systemic risk and its implications for   the costs of financial crises,"Sebastian Poledna, José Luis Molina-Borboa, Serafín Martínez-Jaramillo, Marco van der Leij, Stefan Thurner","The inability to see and quantify systemic financial risk comes at an immense social cost. Systemic risk in the financial system arises to a large extent as a consequence of the interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit, derivatives, foreign exchange and securities. The interplay of the various exposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer network. In this work we quantify the daily contributions to systemic risk from four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007-2013. We show that focusing on a single layer underestimates the total systemic risk by up to 90%. By assigning systemic risk levels to individual banks we study the systemic risk profile of the Mexican banking system on all market layers. This profile can be used to quantify systemic risk on a national level in terms of nation-wide expected systemic losses. We show that market-based systemic risk indicators systematically underestimate expected systemic losses. We find that expected systemic losses are up to a factor four higher now than before the financial crisis of 2007-2008. We find that systemic risk contributions of individual transactions can be up to a factor of thousand higher than the corresponding credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public. We find an intriguing non-linear effect whereby the sum of systemic risk of all layers underestimates the total risk. The method presented here is the first objective data driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that reveal its true levels.",2015-05-16T14:19:24Z,2015-05-16T14:19:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04276v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04276v1,q-fin.RM
Measures of Systemic Risk,"Zachary Feinstein, Birgit Rudloff, Stefan Weber","Systemic risk refers to the risk that the financial system is susceptible to failures due to the characteristics of the system itself. The tremendous cost of systemic risk requires the design and implementation of tools for the efficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current paper proposes a novel approach to measuring systemic risk.   Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of systemic risk measures from the structure of the underlying system and the objectives of a financial regulator. The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms of capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two ingredients: a cash flow or value model that assigns to the capital allocations of the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome; and an acceptability criterion, i.e. a set of random outcomes that are acceptable to a regulatory authority. Systemic risk is measured by the set of allocations of additional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual framework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm for their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case studies.   Many systemic risk measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal amount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after aggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail-out. In contrast, our approach emphasizes operational systemic risk measures that include both ex post bailout costs as well as ex ante capital requirements and may be used to prevent systemic crises.",2015-02-27T16:39:12Z,2016-10-13T22:20:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07961v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07961v5,q-fin.RM
An Event-Driven Compressive Neuromorphic System for Cardiac Arrhythmia   Detection,"Jinbo Chen, Fengshi Tian, Jie Yang, Mohamad Sawan","Wearable electrocardiograph (ECG) recording and processing systems have been developed to detect cardiac arrhythmia to help prevent heart attacks. Conventional wearable systems, however, suffer from high energy consumption at both circuit and system levels. To overcome the design challenges, this paper proposes an event-driven compressive ECG recording and neuromorphic processing system for cardiac arrhythmia detection. The proposed system achieves low power consumption and high arrhythmia detection accuracy via system level co-design with spike-based information representation. Event-driven level-crossing ADC (LC-ADC) is exploited in the recording system, which utilizes the sparsity of ECG signal to enable compressive recording and save ADC energy during the silent signal period. Meanwhile, the proposed spiking convolutional neural network (SCNN) based neuromorphic arrhythmia detection method is inherently compatible with the spike-based output of LC-ADC, hence realizing accurate detection and low energy consumption at system level. Simulation results show that the proposed system with 5-bit LC-ADC achieves 88.6\% reduction of sampled data points compared with Nyquist sampling in the MIT-BIH dataset, and 93.59\% arrhythmia detection accuracy with SCNN, demonstrating the compression ability of LC-ADC and the effectiveness of system level co-design with SCNN.",2022-05-26T12:12:31Z,2022-05-26T12:12:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13292v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13292v1,eess.SP
Systemic risk governance in a dynamical model of a banking system,"Lorella Fatone, Francesca Mariani","We consider the problem of governing systemic risk in a banking system model. The banking system model consists in an initial value problem for a system of stochastic differential equations whose dependent variables are the log-monetary reserves of the banks as functions of time. The banking system model considered generalizes previous models studied in [5], [4], [7] and describes an homogeneous population of banks. Two distinct mechanisms are used to model the cooperation among banks and the cooperation between banks and monetary authority. These mechanisms are regulated respectively by the parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. A bank fails when its log-monetary reserves go below an assigned default level. We call systemic risk or systemic event in a bounded time interval the fact that in that time interval at least a given fraction of the banks fails. The probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval is evaluated using statistical simulation. A method to govern the probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval is presented. The goal of the governance is to keep the probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval between two given thresholds. The governance is based on the choice of the log-monetary reserves of a kind of ""ideal bank"" as a function of time and on the solution of an optimal control problem for the mean field approximation of the banking system model. The solution of the optimal control problem determines the parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ as functions of time, that is defines the rules of the borrowing and lending activity among banks and between banks and monetary authority. Some numerical examples are discussed. The systemic risk governance is tested in absence and in presence of positive and negative shocks acting on the banking system.",2018-12-17T16:10:37Z,2018-12-17T16:10:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06973v1,q-fin.RM
Quantification of systemic risk from overlapping portfolios in the   financial system,"Sebastian Poledna, Serafín Martínez-Jaramillo, Fabio Caccioli, Stefan Thurner","Financial markets are exposed to systemic risk, the risk that a substantial fraction of the system ceases to function and collapses. Systemic risk can propagate through different mechanisms and channels of contagion. One important form of financial contagion arises from indirect interconnections between financial institutions mediated by financial markets. This indirect interconnection occurs when financial institutions invest in common assets and is referred to as overlapping portfolios. In this work we quantify systemic risk from indirect interconnections between financial institutions. Having complete information of security holdings of major Mexican financial intermediaries and the ability to uniquely identify securities in their portfolios, allows us to represent the Mexican financial system as a bipartite network of securities and financial institutions. This makes it possible to quantify systemic risk arising from overlapping portfolios. We show that focusing only on direct exposures underestimates total systemic risk levels by up to 50%. By representing the financial system as a multi-layer network of direct exposures (default contagion) and indirect exposures (overlapping portfolios) we estimate the mutual influence of different channels of contagion. The method presented here is the first objective data-driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that includes overlapping portfolios.",2018-01-31T15:56:05Z,2018-01-31T15:56:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00311v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00311v1,q-fin.RM
Analysis of the particle transfer between two systems under unification,"I. A. Molotkov, A. I.

The First Airborne Experiment of Sparse Microwave Imaging: Prototype   System Design and Result Analysis,"Zhe Zhang, Bingchen Zhang, Chenglong Jiang, Xingdong Liang, Longyong Chen, Wen Hong, Yirong Wu","In this paper we report the first airborne experiments of sparse microwave imaging, conducted in September 2013 and May 2014, using our prototype sparse microwave imaging radar system. This is the first reported imaging radar system and airborne experiment that specially designed for sparse microwave imaging. Sparse microwave imaging is a novel concept of radar imaging, it is mainly the combination of traditional radar imaging technology and newly developed sparse signal processing theory, achieving benefits in both improving the imaging quality of current microwave imaging systems and designing optimized sparse microwave imaging radar system to reduce system sampling rate towards the sparse target scenes. During recent years, many researchers focus on related topics of sparse microwave imaging, but rarely few paid attention to prototype system design and experiment. We introduce our prototype sparse microwave imaging radar system, including its system design, hardware considerations and signal processing methods. Several design principles should be considered during the system designing, including the sampling scheme, antenna, SNR, waveform, resolution, etc. We select jittered sampling in azimuth and uniform sampling in range to balance the system complexity and performance. The imaging algorithm is accelerated $\ell_q$ regularization algorithm. To test the prototype radar system and verify the effectiveness of sparse microwave imaging framework, airborne experiments are carried out using our prototype system and we achieve the first sparse microwave image successfully.

Antenna Selection For Receive Spatial Modulation System Empowered By   Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface,"Burak Ahmet Ozden, Erdogan Aydin","Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enhances signal quality by adjusting the phase of electromagnetic waves in wireless communication. Spatial modulation (SM), a prominent index modulation (IM) technique, provides high spectral efficiency and low energy consumption. In this article, a new wireless communication system is proposed by combining capacity-optimized antenna selection (COAS), antenna correlation antenna selection (ACAS), and Euclidean distance-optimized antenna selection (EDAS)-supported RIS-empowered receive SM (RIS-RSM) system (AS-RIS-RSM) in a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) structure. The proposed AS-RIS-RSM schemes (COAS-RIS-RSM, ACAS-RIS-RSM, and EDAS-RIS-RSM) have superior features such as high spectral efficiency, high energy efficiency, and low error data transmission. Integrating COAS, ACAS, and EDAS techniques into the system enables the selection of the channel with the best conditions, thus increasing the error performance of the proposed system. Also, using RIS increases the error performance of the system by controlling the transmitted signal to a certain extent. The analytical ABER results of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and shown to overlap with simulation results. For the proposed systems, an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector and a sub-optimal low-complexity greedy detector (GD) are offered. Also, capacity analyses of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and it is observed that they have higher capacity compared to RIS-QAM/PSK and RIS-RSM systems. Then, computational complexity analyses of the proposed COAS-RIS-RSM, ACAS-RIS-RSM, and EDAS-RIS-RSM systems are presented. The proposed systems have been compared to counterpart wireless communication systems including RIS-RSM, RIS-QAM, and RIS-PSK under equivalent conditions, demonstrating that the proposed systems achieve better error performance.",2023-11-21T21:30:39Z,2023-11-21T21:30:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13005v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13005v1,eess.SP
Value-at-Risk- and Expectile-based Systemic Risk Measures and   Second-order Asymptotics: With Applications to Diversification,"Bingzhen Geng, Yang Liu, Yimiao Zhao","The systemic risk measure plays a crucial role in analyzing individual losses conditioned on extreme system-wide disasters. In this paper, we provide a unified asymptotic treatment for systemic risk measures. First, we classify them into two families of Value-at-Risk- (VaR-) and expectile-based systemic risk measures. While VaR has been extensively studied, in the latter family, we propose two new systemic risk measures named the Individual Conditional Expectile (ICE) and the Systemic Individual Conditional Expectile (SICE), as alternatives to Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES). Second, to characterize general mutually dependent and heavy-tailed risks, we adopt a modeling framework where the system, represented by a vector of random loss variables, follows a multivariate Sarmanov distribution with a common marginal exhibiting second-order regular variation. Third, we provide second-order asymptotic results for both families of systemic risk measures. This analytical framework offers a more accurate estimate compared to traditional first-order asymptotics. Through numerical and analytical examples, we demonstrate the superiority of second-order asymptotics in accurately assessing systemic risk. Further, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between VaR-based and expectile-based systemic risk measures. Expectile-based measures output higher risk evaluation than VaR-based ones, emphasizing the former's potential advantages in reporting extreme events and tail risk. As a financial application, we use the asymptotic treatment to discuss the diversification benefits associated with systemic risk measures. The expectile-based diversification benefits consistently deduce an underestimation and suggest a conservative approximation, while the VaR-based diversification benefits consistently deduce an overestimation and suggest behaving optimistically.",2024-04-27T23:42:19Z,2024-04-27T23:42:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18029v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18029v1,q-fin.RM
Active margin system for margin loans using cash and stock as collateral   and its application in Chinese market,"Guanghui Huang, Weiqing Gu, Wenting Xing, Hongyu Li","Margin system for margin loans using cash and stock as collateral is considered in this paper, which is the line of defence for brokers against risk associated with margin trading. The conditional probability of negative return is used as risk measure, and a recursive algorithm is proposed to realize this measure under a Markov chain model. Optimal margin system is chosen from those systems which satisfy the constraint of the risk measure. The resulted margin system is able to adjust actively with respect to the changes of stock prices. The margin system required by the Shanghai Stock Exchange is compared with the proposed system, where 25,200 margin loans of 126 stocks listed on the SSE are investigated. It is found that the number of margin calls under the proposed margin system is significantly less than its counterpart under the required system for the same level of risk, and the average costs of the loans are similar under the two types of margin systems.",2012-02-23T13:55:30Z,2012-02-23T13:55:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5180v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5180v1,q-fin.RM

Introducing Resilience to IRS-Assisted Secure Wireless Systems,"Yifei Wu, Mehmet Emin Arslan, Niels Neumann, Wolfgang Gerstacker, Robert Schober","Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned as a transformative method for enhancing the physical layer security of future communication networks. However, current IRS-assisted secure wireless system designs incur high time cost for the joint optimization of beamforming vectors and IRS phase shifts and are susceptible to unforeseen disruption. Therefore, introducing resilience in IRS-assisted secure systems is essential. In this paper, we first quantify the resilience performance as the combination of the absorption and adaptation performance. In particular, the absorption performance measures the system's robustness when facing failure while the adaptation performance reflects the system's ability to recover from failure. Then, we propose a two-timescale transmission protocol aiming to enhance system resilience while limiting maximum information leakage to eavesdroppers. Specifically, in the initialization phase, the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and IRS phase shifts are optimized iteratively using an alternating optimization (AO) approach to improve the absorption performance of the system, i.e., the worst-case achievable rate, given a predefined maximum tolerable leakage rate, by accounting for the impact of long-term channel variations. When the system detects an outage, a fast system recovery mechanism is activated to restore operation by adjusting only the BS beamforming vectors, which enhances the adaptation performance of the system. Our numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly improves system resilience, including system robustness and recovery performance. Moreover, the proposed design guarantees outage-free transmission over a long time interval for moderate-size IRSs.",2025-01-22T00:12:39Z,2025-01-22T00:12:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12551v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12551v1,eess.SP

Playing with Fire? A Mean Field Game Analysis of Fire Sales and Systemic   Risk under Regulatory Capital Constraints,"Rüdiger Frey, Theresa Traxler","We study the impact of regulatory capital constraints on fire sales and financial stability in a large banking system using a mean field game model. In our model banks adjust their holdings of a risky asset via trading strategies with finite trading rate in order to maximize expected profits. Moreover, a bank is liquidated if it violates a stylized regulatory capital constraint. We assume that the drift of the asset value is affected by the average change in the position of the banks in the system. This creates strategic interaction between the trading behavior of banks and thus leads to a game. The equilibria of this game are characterized by a system of coupled PDEs. We solve this system explicitly for a test case without regulatory constraints and numerically for the regulated case. We find that capital constraints can lead to a systemic crisis where a substantial proportion of the banking system defaults simultaneously. Moreover, we discuss proposals from the literature on macroprudential regulation. In particular, we show that in our setup a systemic crisis does not arise if the banking system is sufficiently well capitalized or if improved mechanisms for the resolution of banks violating the risk capital constraints are in place.",2024-06-25T13:11:12Z,2024-06-25T13:11:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17528v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17528v1,q-fin.MF
Double Media-Based Modulation Scheme for High-Rate Wireless   Communication Systems,"Burak Ahmet Ozden, Erdogan Aydin, Fatih Cogen","Current wireless communication technologies are insufficient in the face of ever-increasing demands. Therefore, novel and high-performance communication systems are needed. In this paper, a novel high data rate and high-performance index modulation scheme called double media-based modulation (DMBM) is proposed. The DMBM system doubles the number of mirror activation patterns (MAPs) and the number of transmitted symbols compared to the traditional MBM system during the same symbol period. In this way, the spectral efficiency of the DMBM is doubled and the error performance improves as the number of bits carried in the indices increases. Performance analysis of the DMBM scheme is evaluated for $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ($M$-QAM) on Rayleigh fading channels. The error performance of the proposed DMBM system is compared with spatial modulation (SM), quadrature SM (QSM), MBM, and double SM (DSM) techniques. Also, the throughput, complexity, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, and capacity analyses for the proposed DMBM system and SM, QSM, MBM, and DSM systems are presented. All analysis results show that the proposed DMBM system is superior to the compared systems.",2024-11-11T22:47:16Z,2024-11-11T22:47:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07420v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07420v1,eess.SP
Systemic Losses Due to Counter Party Risk in a Stylized Banking System,"Annika Birch, Tomaso Aste","We report a study of a stylized banking cascade model investigating systemic risk caused by counter party failure using liabilities and assets to define banks' balance sheet. In our stylized system, banks can be in two states: normally operating or distressed and the state of a bank changes from normally operating to distressed whenever its liabilities are larger than the banks' assets. The banks are connected through an interbank lending network and, whenever a bank is distressed, its creditor cannot expect the loan from the distressed bank to be repaid, potentially becoming distressed themselves. We solve the problem analytically for a homogeneous system and test the robustness and generality of the results with simulations of more complex systems. We investigate the parameter space and the corresponding distribution of operating banks mapping the conditions under which the whole system is stable or unstable. This allows us to determine how financial stability of a banking system is influenced by regulatory decisions, such as leverage; we discuss the effect of central bank actions, such as quantitative easing and we determine the cost of rescuing a distressed banking system using re-capitalisation. Finally, we estimate the stability of the UK and US banking systems in the years 2007 and 2012 showing that both banking systems were more unstable in 2007 and connectedness on the interbank market partly caused the banking crisis.",2014-02-15T13:21:11Z,2014-02-15T13:21:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3688v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3688v1,q-fin.GN
"Systemic stability, cell differentiation, and evolution - A dynamical   systems perspective",Rudolf Hanel,"Species or population that proliferate faster than others become dominant in numbers. Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to dominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the available substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of sets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical backbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by organisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the stability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be reshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this paper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary selection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics become predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence large reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic instabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple mathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a statistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable dynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict evolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell differentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here is that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how to differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation. For example, in this framework we can predict that regulatory systems will evolutionary favor networks where the number of catalytic enhancers is not larger than the number of suppressors.",2016-08-30T15:23:02Z,2016-08-30T15:23:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08498v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08498v1,"q-bio.CB, q-bio.MN"
What is the Minimal Systemic Risk in Financial Exposure Networks?,"Christian Diem, Anton Pichler, Stefan Thurner","Management of systemic risk in financial markets is traditionally associated with setting (higher) capital requirements for market participants. There are indications that while equity ratios have been increased massively since the financial crisis, systemic risk levels might not have lowered, but even increased. It has been shown that systemic risk is to a large extent related to the underlying network topology of financial exposures. A natural question arising is how much systemic risk can be eliminated by optimally rearranging these networks and without increasing capital requirements. Overlapping portfolios with minimized systemic risk which provide the same market functionality as empirical ones have been studied by [pichler2018]. Here we propose a similar method for direct exposure networks, and apply it to cross-sectional interbank loan networks, consisting of 10 quarterly observations of the Austrian interbank market. We show that the suggested framework rearranges the network topology, such that systemic risk is reduced by a factor of approximately 3.5, and leaves the relevant economic features of the optimized network and its agents unchanged. The presented optimization procedure is not intended to actually re-configure interbank markets, but to demonstrate the huge potential for systemic risk management through rearranging exposure networks, in contrast to increasing capital requirements that were shown to have only marginal effects on systemic risk [poledna2017]. Ways to actually incentivize a self-organized formation toward optimal network configurations were introduced in [thurner2013] and [poledna2016]. For regulatory policies concerning financial market stability the knowledge of minimal systemic risk for a given economic environment can serve as a benchmark for monitoring actual systemic risk in markets.",2019-05-15T03:42:06Z,2019-05-15T03:42:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05931v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05931v1,"q-fin.CP, q-fin.RM"
A Low Cost Modular Radio Tomography System for Bicycle and Vehicle   Detection and Classification,"Marcus Haferkamp, Benjamin Sliwa, Christian Wietfeld","The advancing deployment of ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT)-powered vehicle detection and classification systems will successively turn the existing road infrastructure into a highly dynamical and interconnected Cyber-physical System (CPS). Though many different sensor systems have been proposed in recent years, these solutions can only meet a subset of requirements, including cost-efficiency, robustness, accuracy, and privacy preservation. This paper provides a modular system approach that exploits radio tomography in terms of attenuation patterns and highly accurate channel information for reliable and robust detection and classification of different road users. Hereto, we use Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) transceiver modules providing either Channel State Information (CSI) or Channel Impulse Response (CIR) data. Since the proposed system utilizes off-the-shelf and power-efficient embedded systems, it allows for a cost-efficient ad-hoc deployment in existing road infrastructures. We have evaluated the proposed system's performance for cyclists and other motorized vehicles with an experimental live deployment. In this concern, the primary focus has been on the accurate detection of cyclists on a bicycle path. However, we also have conducted preliminary evaluation tests measuring different motorized vehicles using a similar system configuration as for the cyclists. In summary, the system achieves up to 100% accuracy for detecting cyclists and more than 98% classifying cyclists and cars.",2021-02-11T16:42:05Z,2021-02-11T16:42:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06107v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06107v1,eess.SP
"Balls, cups, and quasi-potentials: quantifying stability in stochastic   systems","Ben C. Nolting, Karen C. Abbott","When a system has more than one stable state, how can the stability of these states be compared? This deceptively simple question has important consequences for ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo dramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of these shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states. Unfortunately, the concept of stability in ecology has suffered from substantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where stochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable states. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a ball-in-cup diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the position of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push the ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by a potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. However, systems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite rare. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other approaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear stability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and, as we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will behave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how the potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly, employing a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using three classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential provides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems.",2015-08-09T21:52:48Z,2015-10-23T05:07:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02088v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02088v3,q-bio.PE
Performance analysis of a novel hybrid FSO / RF communication system,Mohammad Ali Amirabadi,"In this paper, a novel dual-hop relay-assisted hybrid Free Space Optical / Radio Frequency (FSO / RF) communication system is presented. In this structure an access point connects users within the building to the Base Station via a hybrid parallel FSO / RF link, this link is proposed firstly. Parallel combination of FSO and RF links and use of an access point, will increase capacity, reliability and data rate of the system. It is the first time that the effect of number of users on the performance of a dual-hop relay-assisted hybrid parallel FSO / RF system is investigated. FSO link is considered in Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence with the effect of pointing error and RF link is considered in Rayleigh fading. For the first time, closed-form expressions are derived for Bit Error Rate (BER) and Outage Probability (P_out) of the proposed system. Derived expressions are verified through MATLAB simulations. It is shown that the performance of the proposed system is almost independent of atmospheric turbulence intensity, thereby when atmospheric turbulence strengthens, low power consumption is required for maintenance of the system performance. Hence the proposed structure is particularly suitable for mobile communication systems in which a small mobile battery supplies transmitter power. Also the proposed system performance of the system is preferable even at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, proposed structure significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining performance of the system.",2018-02-19T13:54:02Z,2018-11-20T07:47:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07160v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07160v3,eess.SP
Developing a Theoretical Framework for Optofluidic Device Designing for   System Identification in Systems Biology: the EGFR Study Case,"Filippo Menolascina, Vitoantonio Bevilacqua, Caterina Ciminelli, Stefania Tommasi, Angelo Paradiso",Identification of dynamics underlying biochemical pathways of interest in oncology is a primary goal in current systems biology. Understanding structures and interactions that govern the evolution of such systems is believed to be a cornerstone in this research. Systems theory and systems identification theory are primary resources for this task since they both provide a self consistent framework for modelling and manipulating models of dynamical systems that are best suited for the problem under investigation. We address herein the issue of obtaining an informative dataset ZN to be used as starting point for identification of EGFR pathway dynamics. In order to match experimental identifiability criteria we propose a theoretical framework for input stimulus design based on dynamical properties of the system under investigation. A feasible optofluidic design has been designed on the basis of the spectral properties of the driving inputs that maximize information content after the theoretical studies.,2008-04-19T07:21:07Z,2008-04-19T07:21:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3128v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.3128v1,"q-bio.OT, q-bio.MN"
Active margin system for margin loans and its application in Chinese   market: using cash and randomly selected stock as collateral,"Guanghui Huang, Wenting Xin, Weiqing Gu","An active margin system for margin loans is proposed for Chinese margin lending market, which uses cash and randomly selected stock as collateral. The conditional probability of negative return(CPNR) after a forced sale of securities from under-margined account in a falling market is used to measure the risk faced by the brokers, and the margin system is chosen under the constraint of the risk measure. In order to calculate CPNR, a recursive algorithm is proposed under a Markov chain model, which is constructed by sample learning method. The resulted margin system is an active system, which is able to adjust actively with respect to the changes of stock prices and the changes of different collateral. The resulted margin system is applied to 30,000 margin loans of 150 stocks listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange. The empirical results show the number of margin calls and the average costs of the loans under the proposed margin system are less than their counterparts under the system required by SSE and SZSE.",2012-02-22T14:18:17Z,2012-02-23T13:59:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4913v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4913v2,q-fin.RM
Optimal portfolio for a robust financial system,"Yoshiharu Maeno, Kenji Nishiguchi, Satoshi Morinaga, Hirokazu Matsushima","This study presents an ANWSER model (asset network systemic risk model) to quantify the risk of financial contagion which manifests itself in a financial crisis. The transmission of financial distress is governed by a heterogeneous bank credit network and an investment portfolio of banks. Bankruptcy reproductive ratio of a financial system is computed as a function of the diversity and risk exposure of an investment portfolio of banks, and the denseness and concentration of a heterogeneous bank credit network. An analytic solution of the bankruptcy reproductive ratio for a small financial system is derived and a numerical solution for a large financial system is obtained. For a large financial system, Large diversity among banks in the investment portfolio makes financial contagion more damaging on the average. But large diversity is essentially effective in eliminating the risk of financial contagion in the worst case of financial crisis scenarios. A bank-unique specialization portfolio is more suitable than a uniform diversification portfolio and a system-wide specialization portfolio in strengthening the robustness of a financial system.",2012-11-22T09:09:04Z,2013-02-05T07:29:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5235v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.5235v2,q-fin.RM

Generalized modeling of empirical social-ecological systems,"Steven J. Lade, Susa Niiranen","Modeling social-ecological systems is difficult due to the complexity of ecosystems and of individual and collective human behavior. Key components of the social-ecological system are often over-simplified or omitted. Generalized modeling is a dynamical systems approach that can overcome some of these challenges. It can rigorously analyze qualitative system dynamics such as regime shifts despite incomplete knowledge of the model's constituent processes. Here, we review generalized modeling and use a recent study on the Baltic Sea cod fishery's boom and collapse to demonstrate its application to modeling the dynamics of empirical social-ecological systems. These empirical applications demand new methods of analysis suited to larger, more complicated generalized models. Generalized modeling is a promising tool for rapidly developing mathematically rigorous, process-based understanding of a social-ecological system's dynamics despite limited knowledge of the system.",2015-03-10T10:15:23Z,2017-05-24T16:17:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02846v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02846v2,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.PE"

Demand profile clustering is identical to cluster consumers according to their marginal impacts on system costs. A profile-based uniform-rate price is economically efficient as real-time pricing. We develop a criteria system to evaluate the economic efficiency of an implemented retail price scheme in a distribution system by comparing profile clustering and daily-average clustering. Our criteria system can examine the extent of a retail price scheme's inefficiency even without information about the distribution system's daily cost structure.

Adversarial Transformation of Spoofing Attacks for Voice Biometrics,"Alejandro Gomez-Alanis, Jose A. Gonzalez-Lopez, Antonio M. Peinado","Voice biometric systems based on automatic speaker verification (ASV) are exposed to \textit{spoofing} attacks which may compromise their security. To increase the robustness against such attacks, anti-spoofing or presentation attack detection (PAD) systems have been proposed for the detection of replay, synthesis and voice conversion based attacks. Recently, the scientific community has shown that PAD systems are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work have studied the robustness of full voice biometrics systems (ASV + PAD) to these new types of adversarial \textit{spoofing} attacks. In this work, we develop a new adversarial biometrics transformation network (ABTN) which jointly processes the loss of the PAD and ASV systems in order to generate white-box and black-box adversarial \textit{spoofing} attacks. The core idea of this system is to generate adversarial \textit{spoofing} attacks which are able to fool the PAD system without being detected by the ASV system. The experiments were carried out on the ASVspoof 2019 corpus, including both logical access (LA) and physical access (PA) scenarios.

Double-RIS Versus Single-RIS Aided Systems: Tensor-Based MIMO Channel   Estimation and Design Perspectives,"Khaled Ardah, Sepideh Gherekhloo, André L.

However, most of the current works assume single-RIS (S-RIS)-aided systems, which can be limited in some application scenarios where a transmitter might need a multi-RIS-aided channel to communicate with a receiver. In this paper, we consider a double-RIS (D-RIS)-aided MIMO system and propose an alternating least-squared-based channel estimation method by exploiting the Tucker2 tensor structure of the received signals. Using the proposed method, the cascaded MIMO channel parts can be estimated separately, up to trivial scaling factors. Compared with the S-RIS systems, we show that if the RIS elements of a S-RIS system are distributed carefully between the two RISs in a D-RIS system, the training overhead can be reduced and the estimation accuracy can also be increased. Therefore, D-RIS systems can be seen as an appealing approach to further increase the coverage, capacity, and efficiency of future wireless networks compared to S-RIS systems.",2021-09-19T10:25:18Z,2021-09-19T10:25:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09099v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09099v1,eess.SP

V2X Enabled Emergency Vehicle Alert System,"Nitish Kumar, Hershita Shukla, P. Rajalakhsmi","Today's major concern in traffic management systems includes time-efficient emergency transports. The awareness of environment and vehicle information is necessary for the emergency vehicles as well as the surrounding commercial vehicles that might be driven by inexperienced drivers to act accordingly if they both interact.

How particular is the physics of the free energy principle?,"Miguel Aguilera, Beren Millidge, Alexander Tschantz, Christopher L. Buckley","The free energy principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment. In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the simplest possible set of systems -- weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general the requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system are and (ii) how informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We discover that two requirements of the FEP -- the Markov blanket condition (i.e. a statistical boundary precluding direct coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a system out of equilibrium) -- are only valid for a very narrow space of parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an environment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference, relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions. These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability of the FEP and indicate the existence of significant problems of the theory in its current form. These issues make the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear systems studied here and suggest that more development is needed before the theory could be applied to the kind of complex systems that describe living and cognitive processes.",2021-05-24T11:17:10Z,2022-05-19T21:49:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11203v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11203v3,q-bio.NC
On Modelling The Immune System as a Complex system,"E. Ahmed, A. H. Hashish","We argue that immune system is an adaptive complex system. It is shown that it has emergent properties. Its network structure is of the small world network type. The network is of the threshold type, which helps in avoiding autoimmunity. It has the property that every antigen (e.g.virus or bacteria) is typically attacked by more than one effector. This stabilizes the equilibrium state. Modelling complex systems is discussed. Cellular automata (CA) type models are successful but there are much less analytic results about CA than about other less successful models e.g. partial differential equations (PDE). A compromise is proposed",2008-01-06T08:24:35Z,2008-01-06T08:24:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0847v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.0847v1,q-bio.PE
Existence and stability of stationary solutions to spatially extended   autocatalytic and hypercyclic systems under global regulation and with   nonlinear growth rates,"Alexander S. Bratus', Vladimir P. Posvyanskii, Artem S. Novozhilov","Analytical analysis of spatially extended autocatalytic and hypercyclic systems is presented. It is shown that spatially explicit systems in the form of reaction-diffusion equations with global regulation possess the same major qualitative features as the corresponding local models. In particular, using the introduced notion of the stability in the mean integral sense we prove the competitive exclusion principle for the autocatalytic system and the permanence for the hypercycle system. Existence and stability of stationary solutions are studied. For some parameter values it is proved that stable spatially non-uniform solutions appear.",2009-01-22T21:02:54Z,2009-01-22T21:02:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3556v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.3556v1,q-bio.PE
Global entrainment of transcriptional systems to periodic inputs,"Giovanni Russo, Mario di Bernardo, Eduardo D. Sontag","This paper addresses the problem of giving conditions for transcriptional systems to be globally entrained to external periodic inputs. By using contraction theory, a powerful tool from dynamical systems theory, it is shown that certain systems driven by external periodic signals have the property that all solutions converge to a fixed limit cycle. General results are proved, and the properties are verified in the specific case of some models of transcriptional systems. The basic mathematical results needed from contraction theory are proved in the paper, making it self-contained.",2009-06-30T20:12:08Z,2009-06-30T20:12:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0017v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.0017v1,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.MN"
Noise-induced multistability in chemical systems: Discrete vs Continuum   modeling,"Andrew Duncan, Shuohao Liao, Tomas Vejchodsky, Radek Erban, Ramon Grima","The noisy dynamics of chemical systems is commonly studied using either the chemical master equation (CME) or the chemical Fokker-Planck equation (CFPE). The latter is a continuum approximation of the discrete CME approach. We here show that the CFPE may fail to capture the CME's prediction of noise-induced multistability. In particular we find a simple chemical system for which the CME's marginal probability distribution changes from unimodal to multimodal as the system-size decreases below a critical value, while the CFPE's marginal probability distribution is unimodal for all physically meaningful system sizes.",2014-07-31T01:53:10Z,2014-07-31T01:53:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8256v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.8256v1,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.SC"
Hybrid beamforming for single carrier mmWave MIMO systems,"Tian Lin, Jiaqi Cong, Yu Zhu","Hybrid analog and digital beamforming (HBF) has been recognized as an attractive technique offering a tradeoff between hardware implementation limitation and system performance for future broadband millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. In contrast to most current works focusing on the HBF design for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based mmWave systems, this paper investigates the HBF design for single carrier (SC) systems due to the advantage of low peak-to-average power ratio in transmissions. By applying the alternating minimization method, we propose an efficient HBF scheme based on the minimum mean square error criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional HBF scheme for SC systems.",2019-02-26T14:11:17Z,2019-02-26T14:11:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09943v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09943v1,eess.SP
Distributed Focus and Digital Zoom,"Wubin Pang, David J. Brady","We explore integrated microcamera focus systems for array cameras. We propose a new model for system camera integration relying on fast action focus mechanisms with >10mm aperture. Rather than reducing resolution or expanding aperture size, such systems can be used in arrays to enable digital zoom. We show that a common mechanism supports camera modules with focal lengths ranging from 25 to 60 mm. Designs for each focal length include a fixed objective lens group and an adjustable back focus group. Increasing the focal power of the front focal group enables the travel range of available microcamera modules to accommodate long focal length systems. We present design examples both discrete and multiscale array camera systems.",2019-09-13T21:14:40Z,2019-09-13T21:14:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06451v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06451v1,eess.IV
Dynamic Interaction Between Asset Prices and Bank Behavior: A Systemic   Risk Perspective,"Aki-Hiro Sato, Paolo Tasca, Takashi Isogai","Systemic risk in banking systems remains a crucial issue that it has not been completely understood. In our toy model, banks are exposed to two sources of risks, namely, market risk from their investments in assets external to the banking system and credit risk from their lending in the interbank market. By and large, both risks increase during severe financial turmoil. Under this scenario, the paper shows the conditions under which both the individual and the systemic default tend to coincide.",2015-04-27T16:34:59Z,2017-02-18T00:39:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07152v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07152v3,"q-fin.RM, q-fin.CP"
Optimization of RIS Configurations for Multiple-RIS-Aided mmWave   Positioning Systems based on CRLB Analysis,"Yu Liu, Sheng Hong, Cunhua Pan, Yinlu Wang, Yijin Pan, Ming Chen","Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems. However, its potential benefits of adopting RIS for high-precision positioning in mmWave systems are still less understood. In this paper, we study a multiple-RIS-aided mmWave positioning system and derive the Cram$\rm{\acute{e}}$r-Rao error bound. Based on the derived bound, we optimize the phase shift of the RISs by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Numerical results have demonstrated the advantages of using multiple RISs in enhancing the positioning accuracy in mmWave systems.",2021-11-28T02:28:06Z,2021-11-28T02:28:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14023v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14023v1,eess.SP
Risk-Consistent Conditional Systemic Risk Measures,"Hannes Hoffmann, Thilo Meyer-Brandis, Gregor Svindland","We axiomatically introduce risk-consistent conditional systemic risk measures defined on multidimensional risks. This class consists of those conditional systemic risk measures which can be decomposed into a state-wise conditional aggregation and a univariate conditional risk measure. Our studies extend known results for unconditional risk measures on finite state spaces. We argue in favor of a conditional framework on general probability spaces for assessing systemic risk. Mathematically, the problem reduces to selecting a realization of a random field with suitable properties. Moreover, our approach covers many prominent examples of systemic risk measures from the literature and used in practice.",2016-09-26T09:25:07Z,2016-09-26T09:25:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07897v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07897v1,q-fin.RM
Coexistence between Communication and Radar Systems - A Survey,"Mina Labib, Vuk Marojevic, Anthony F. Martone, Jeffrey H. Reed, Amir I. Zaghloul","Data traffic demand in cellular networks has been tremendously growing and has led to creating congested RF environment. Accordingly, innovative approaches for spectrum sharing have been proposed and implemented to accommodate several systems within the same frequency band. Spectrum sharing between radar and communication systems is one of the important research and development areas. In this paper, we present the fundamental spectrum sharing concepts and technologies, then we provide an updated and comprehensive survey of spectrum sharing techniques that have been developed to enable some of the wireless communication systems to coexist in the same band as radar systems.",2017-09-25T16:22:33Z,2017-09-25T16:22:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08573v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08573v1,eess.SP
False Target Detection in OFDM-based Joint RADAR-Communication Systems,Antonios Argyriou,"Joint RADAR communication (JRC) systems that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be compromised by an adversary that re-produces the received OFDM signal creating thus false RADAR targets. This paper presents a set of algorithms that can be deployed at the JRC system and can detect the presence of false targets. The presence of a false target is detected depending on whether there is residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) beyond Doppler in the received signal, with a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). To evaluate the performance of our approach we measure the detection probability versus the false alarm rate through simulation for different system configurations of an IEEE 802.11-based JRC system.",2023-03-26T17:18:23Z,2023-03-26T17:18:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14782v1,eess.SP
