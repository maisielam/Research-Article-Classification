Minimising the expectation value of the procurement cost in electricity   markets based on the prediction error of energy consumption,"Naoya Yamaguchi, Maiya Hori, Yoshinari Ideguchi","In this paper, we formulate a method for minimising the expectation value of the procurement cost of electricity in two popular spot markets: {\it day-ahead} and {\it intra-day}, under the assumption that expectation value of unit prices and the distributions of prediction errors for the electricity demand traded in two markets are known. The expectation value of the total electricity cost is minimised over two parameters that change the amounts of electricity. Two parameters depend only on the expected unit prices of electricity and the distributions of prediction errors for the electricity demand traded in two markets. That is, even if we do not know the predictions for the electricity demand, we can determine the values of two parameters that minimise the expectation value of the procurement cost of electricity in two popular spot markets. We demonstrate numerically that the estimate of two parameters often results in a small variance of the total electricity cost, and illustrate the usefulness of the proposed procurement method through the analysis of actual data.",2018-02-22T14:29:05Z,2018-08-01T11:13:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04532v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04532v2,"q-fin.EC, q-fin.GN"
Long-term memory in electricity prices: Czech market evidence,"Ladislav Kristoufek, Petra Lunackova","We analyze long-term memory properties of hourly prices of electricity in the Czech Republic between 2009 and 2012. As the dynamics of the electricity prices is dominated by cycles -- mainly intraday and daily -- we opt for the detrended fluctuation analysis, which is well suited for such specific series. We find that the electricity prices are non-stationary but strongly mean-reverting which distinguishes them from other financial assets which are usually characterized as unit root series. Such description is attributed to specific features of electricity prices, mainly to non-storability. Additionally, we argue that the rapid mean-reversion is due to the principles of electricity spot prices. These properties are shown to be stable across all studied years.",2013-09-03T04:02:28Z,2013-09-03T04:02:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0582v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0582v1,q-fin.ST
RFID-BASED Prepaid Power Meter,"Rozita Teymourzadeh, Mahmud Iwan, Ahmad J. A. Abueida","An Electric power meter is an important component in electric energy service. In the past, many consumers have complained about reading inaccurate of the electric meter. This research presents the development of an electrical power meter equipped with RFID reader. The RFID reader reads a valid RFID card and activates the power meter so that it can supply electricity.

Comparison of two models of electric neuro-stimulation and consequences   for the design of retinal prostheses,Erich W. Schmid,"Two simple mathematical models of electric neuro-stimulation are derived and discussed. It is found that the common injected-charge model is less realistic than a model, in which a latency period, which follows after a short electric pulse, plays a role as important as the electric pulse. A stimulation signal is proposed that takes advantage of these findings and calls for experimental testing.",2007-11-13T09:32:33Z,2007-11-13T09:32:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1938v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.1938v1,q-bio.NC
"Cellular velocity, electrical persistence and sensing in developed and   vegetative cells during electrotaxis","Isabella Guido, Douglas Diehl, Nora Aleida Olszok, Eberhard Bodenschatz","Cells have the ability to detect electric fields and respond to them with directed migratory movement. Investigations identified genes and proteins that play important roles in defining the migration efficiency. Nevertheless, the sensing and transduction mechanisms underlying directed cell migration are still under discussion. We use Dictyostelium discoideum cells as model system for studying eukaryotic cell migration in DC electric fields. We have defined the temporal electric persistence to characterize the memory that cells have in a varying electric field. In addition to imposing a directional bias, we observed that the electric field influences the cellular kinematics by accelerating the movement of cells along their paths. Moreover, the study of vegetative and briefly starved cells provided insight into the electrical sensing of cells. We found evidence that conditioned medium of starved cells was able to trigger the electrical sensing of vegetative cells that would otherwise not orient themselves in the electric field. This observation may be explained by the presence of the conditioned medium factor (CMF), a protein secreted by the cells, when they begin to starve. The results of this study give new insights into understanding the mechanism that triggers the electrical sensing and transduces the external stimulus into directed cell migration. Finally, the observed increased mobility of cells over time in an electric field could offer a novel perspective towards wound healing assays.",2020-04-16T10:29:48Z,2020-04-16T10:29:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07575v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07575v1,q-bio.CB
Nash equilibrium for coupling of CO2 allowances and electricity markets,"Mireille Bossy, Nadia Maizi, Odile Pourtallier","In this note, we present an existence result of a Nash equilibrium between electricity producers selling their production on an electricity market and buying CO2 emission allowances on an auction carbon market.

Valuation of electricity storage contracts using the COS method,"Boris C. Boonstra, Cornelis W. Oosterlee","Storage of electricity has become increasingly important, due to the gradual replacement of fossil fuels by more variable and uncertain renewable energy sources. In this paper, we provide details on how to mathematically formalize a corresponding electricity storage contract, taking into account the physical limitations of a storage facility and the operational constraints of the electricity grid. We give details of a valuation technique to price these contracts, where the electricity prices follow a structural model based on a stochastic polynomial process. In particular, we show that the Fourier-based COS method can be used to price the contracts accurately and efficiently.",2021-01-08T08:53:45Z,2021-01-08T08:53:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02917v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02917v1,q-fin.MF
Day-ahead electricity price prediction applying hybrid models of   LSTM-based deep learning methods and feature selection algorithms under   consideration of market coupling,"Wei Li, Denis Mike Becker","The availability of accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasts is pivotal for electricity market participants. In the context of trade liberalisation and market harmonisation in the European markets, accurate price forecasting becomes difficult for electricity market participants to obtain because electricity forecasting requires the consideration of features from ever-growing coupling markets. This study provides a method of exploring the influence of market coupling on electricity price prediction. We apply state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural networks combined with feature selection algorithms for electricity price prediction under the consideration of market coupling. LSTM models have a good performance in handling nonlinear and complex problems and processing time series data. In our empirical study of the Nordic market, the proposed models obtain considerably accurate results. The results show that feature selection is essential to achieving accurate prediction, and features from integrated markets have an impact on prediction. The feature importance analysis implies that the German market has a salient role in the price generation of Nord Pool.",2021-01-13T18:22:28Z,2021-07-18T10:59:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05249v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05249v2,q-fin.CP
Pricing electricity derivatives within a Markov regime-switching model,Joanna Janczura,"In this paper analytic formulas for electricity derivatives are calculated. To this end, we assume that electricity spot prices follow a 3-regime Markov regime-switching model with independent spikes and drops and periodic transition matrix. Since the classical derivatives pricing methodology cannot be used in case of non-storable commodities, we employ the concept of the risk premium. The obtained theoretical results are then used for the European Energy Exchange (EEX) market data. The 3-regime model is calibrated to the spot electricity prices. Next, the risk premium is derived and used to calculate prices of European options written on spot, as well as, forward prices.",2012-03-24T19:41:11Z,2012-03-24T19:41:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5442v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5442v1,q-fin.PR

Deep Reinforcement Learning in Electricity Generation Investment for the   Minimization of Long-Term Carbon Emissions and Electricity Costs,"Alexander J. M. Kell, Pablo Salas, Jean-Francois Mercure, Matthew Forshaw, A. Stephen McGough","A change from a high-carbon emitting electricity power system to one based on renewables would aid in the mitigation of climate change. Decarbonization of the electricity grid would allow for low-carbon heating, cooling and transport. Investments in renewable energy must be made over a long time horizon to maximise return of investment of these long life power generators. Over these long time horizons, there exist multiple uncertainties, for example in future electricity demand and costs to consumers and investors.   To mitigate for imperfect information of the future, we use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize for a low-cost, low-carbon electricity supply using a modified version of the FTT:Power model. In this work, we model the UK and Ireland electricity markets. The DDPG algorithm is able to learn the optimum electricity mix through experience and achieves this between the years of 2017 and 2050. We find that a change from fossil fuels and nuclear power to renewables, based upon wind, solar and wave would provide a cheap and low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels.",2020-11-02T15:20:49Z,2020-11-02T15:20:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02342v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02342v1,eess.SP
Climate change impacts on large-scale electricity system design   decisions for the 21st Century,"Smail Kozarcanin, Hailiang Liu, Gorm Bruun Andresen","Efforts to reduce climate change, but also falling prices and significant technology developments currently drive an increased weather-dependent electricity production from renewable electricity sources. In light of the changing climate, it is highly relevant to investigate the extent of weather changes that directly impacts the best system design decisions for these weather-dependent technologies. Here, we use three IPCC representative CO2 concentrations pathways for the period 2006--2100 with six high-resolution climate experiments for the European domain. Climate elements are used to calculate bias adjusted 3-hourly time series of wind and solar generation, and temperature corrected demand time series for 30 European countries using state-of-the-art methodology. Weather-driven electricity system analysis methodology is then applied to compare four key metrics of highly renewable electricity systems. We find that climate change does not have a discernible impact on the key metrics of the combined electricity system dynamics, and conclude that the effect on important system design parameters can likely be ignored.",2018-05-02T15:32:36Z,2018-05-02T15:32:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01364v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01364v1,eess.SP
Voltage Profile Improvement of Distribution Grid by Using a New Control   Approach on Injected Reactive Power of Plug-in Electric Vehicle Parking Lots   to Grid,"Mohammad Mehdi Rezvani, Reza Khoud","Establishing electrical parking lots will become more important by increasing the use of electric vehicles (EVs). These parking lots not only can be seen as high electrical power consumption loads which can cause the voltage drop at feeders but also they can be used as electrical power plants that can help the main power grid during the load peak hour or any congestion. Therefore, finding an optimum place for the building of these lots, in which the deviation of the voltage at the feeder, power loss in the grid, and cost be minimized, is essential. In this paper, a new method of vehicle-to-grid reactive power support (V2GQ) has been used to add the model of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) as one part of the objective function to find the optimum place of parking lots. The non-sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA2) is used here as an optimization algorithm to find the optimum voltage profile based on the location of parking lots. For validation of the purposed method, a 33-bus standard distribution network has been studied.",2019-01-29T20:44:02Z,2019-01-29T20:44:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10533v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10533v1,eess.SP
Metabolic basis of brain-like electrical signalling in bacterial   communities,"Rosa Martinez-Corral, Jintao Liu, Arthur Prindle, Gurol M. Suel, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo","Information processing in the mammalian brain relies on a careful regulation of the membrane potential dynamics of its constituent neurons, which propagates across the neuronal tissue via electrical signalling. We recently reported the existence of electrical signalling in a much simpler organism, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In dense bacterial communities known as biofilms, nutrient-deprived B. subtilis cells in the interior of the colony use electrical communication to transmit stress signals to the periphery, which interfere with the growth of peripheral cells and reduce nutrient consumption, thereby relieving stress from the interior. Here we explicitly address the interplay between metabolism and electrophysiology in bacterial biofilms, by introducing a spatially-extended mathematical model that combines the metabolic and electrical components of the phenomenon in a discretised reaction-diffusion scheme. The model is experimentally validated by environmental and genetic perturbations, and confirms that metabolic stress is transmitted through the bacterial population via a potassium wave. Interestingly, this behaviour is reminiscent of cortical spreading depression in the brain, characterised by a wave of electrical activity mediated by potassium diffusion that has been linked to various neurological disorders, calling for future studies on the evolutionary link between the two phenomena.",2019-02-17T23:47:34Z,2019-02-17T23:47:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06352v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06352v1,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.CB"
Effects of electrical and optogenetic deep brain stimulation on   synchronized oscillatory activity in Parkinsonian basal ganglia,"Shivakeshavan Ratnadurai-Giridharan, Chung Cheung, Leonid Rubchinsky",Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) of basal ganglia uses high-frequency regular electrical pulses to treat Parkinsonian motor symptoms and has a series of limitations. Relatively new and not yet clinically tested optogenetic stimulation is an effective experimental stimulation technique to affect pathological network dynamics. We compared the effects of electrical and optogenetic stimulation of the basal ganglia on the pathological parkinsonian rhythmic neural activity. We studied the network response to electrical stimulation and excitatory and inhibitory optogenetic stimulations. Different stimulations exhibit different interactions with pathological activity in the network. We studied these interactions for different network and stimulation parameter values. Optogenetic stimulation was found to be more efficient than electrical stimulation in suppressing pathological rhythmicity. Our findings indicate that optogenetic control of neural synchrony may be more efficacious than electrical control because of the different ways of how stimulations interact with network dynamics.,2017-06-03T16:45:21Z,2017-06-03T16:45:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00976v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00976v1,q-bio.NC
Tuning the Transdermal Transport by Application of External Continuous   Electric Field: A Molecular Dynamics Coarse-Grained Study,"Neila Machado, Clarissa Callegaro, Marcelo Augusto Christoffolete, Herculano Martinho","Since a long time the application of small electric potentials on biological membranes (iontophoresis) proved enabling control and improvement of transdermal delivery of substances across this barrier. In spite of a large experimental data, the detailed molecular mechanism of iontophoresis is absent. In the present work the interaction among the external continuous electric field with the outermost layer of the skin (\textit{stratum corneum}) was studied by coarse-grained molecular dynamics. Our results pointed out the occurrence of water-rich vesicles formation depending on the field strength. The corresponding phase diagram indicated that the large set of phenomena (vesicle formation, reversibility, phase transition, disruption) could be completely controlled by tuning external continuous electric fields. Interestingly, electric field shielding effects are in the origin of observed effects and followed a general Arrhenius-like time dependence. Direct current (DC) electric field usage would also have booster diffusion effects due to vesicles creation and reincorporation which would have direct beneficial absorption effects on water-soluble topical agents (vitamins) or dermal jet-injection of drugs by fine needles.",2019-05-06T17:56:32Z,2019-05-06T17:56:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02183v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02183v1,"q-bio.TO, q-bio.SC"
A portfolio management of a small RES utility with a Structural Vector   Autoregressive model of German electricity markets,Katarzyna Maciejowska,"The changes in electricity markets expose RES producers and electricity traders to various risks, among which the price and the volume risk play a very important role. In this research, a portfolio building strategies are presented, which allow to dynamically choose a proportion of electricity traded in different electricity markets (day-ahead and intraday) and hence to optimize the behavior of an utility. Two types of approaches are considered: simple, assuming that the proportions are fixed, and data driven, which allows for thier fluctuation. In order to explore the market information, Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model is applied, which allows to estimate the relationship between variables of interest and to simulate their future distribution. The presented methods are evaluated with data coming from German electricity market. The results indicate that data driven trading strategies allow to increase the utility revenue and at the same time reduce the trading risk, measured by the predictability of the next day income and the revenue Value at Risk. It turns out that the approach based on Sharp Ratio provides the most robust results.",2022-04-28T10:24:03Z,2022-04-28T10:24:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00975v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00975v1,q-fin.ST
Predicting the Impact of Electric Field Stimulation in a Detailed   Computational Model of Cortical Tissue,"Frances Hutchings, Christopher Thornton, Chencheng Zhang, Yujiang Wang, Marcus Kaiser","Neurostimulation using weak electric fields has generated excitement in recent years due to its potential as a medical intervention. However, study of this stimulation modality has been hampered by inconsistent results and large variability within and between studies. In order to begin addressing this variability we need to properly characterise the impact of the current on the underlying neuron populations. To develop and test a computational model capable of capturing the impact of electric field stimulation on networks of neurons. We construct a cortical tissue model with distinct layers and explicit neuron morphologies. We then apply a model of electrical stimulation and carry out multiple test case simulations. The cortical slice model is compared to experimental literature and shown to capture the main features of the electrophysiological response to stimulation. Namely, the model showed 1) a similar level of depolarisation in individual pyramidal neurons, 2) acceleration of intrinsic oscillations, and 3) retention of the spatial profile of oscillations in different layers. We then apply alternative electric fields to demonstrate how the model can capture differences in neuronal responses to the electric field. We demonstrate that the tissue response is dependent on layer depth, the angle of the apical dendrite relative to the field, and stimulation strength. We present publicly available computational modelling software that predicts the neuron network population response to electric field stimulation.",2020-01-28T15:37:03Z,2020-01-28T15:37:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10414v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10414v1,q-bio.NC
Electricity price modeling and asset valuation: a multi-fuel structural   approach,"Rene Carmona, Michael Coulon, Daniel Schwarz","We introduce a new and highly tractable structural model for spot and derivative prices in electricity markets. Using a stochastic model of the bid stack, we translate the demand for power and the prices of generating fuels into electricity spot prices. The stack structure allows for a range of generator efficiencies per fuel type and for the possibility of future changes in the merit order of the fuels. The derived spot price process captures important stylized facts of historical electricity prices, including both spikes and the complex dependence upon its underlying supply and demand drivers. Furthermore, under mild and commonly used assumptions on the distributions of the input factors, we obtain closed-form formulae for electricity forward contracts and for spark and dark spread options. As merit order dynamics and fuel forward prices are embedded into the model, we capture a much richer and more realistic dependence structure than can be achieved by classical reduced-form models. We illustrate these advantages by comparing with Margrabe's formula and a simple cointegration model, and highlight important implications for the valuation of power plants.",2012-05-10T15:58:24Z,2012-05-10T15:58:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2299v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2299v1,q-fin.PR
Hierarchical structure of the countries based on electricity consumption   and economic growth,"Ersin Kantar, Alper Aslan, Bayram Deviren, Mustafa Keskin","We investigate the hierarchical structures of countries based on electricity consumption and economic growth by using the real amounts of their consumption over a certain time period. We use of electricity consumption data to detect the topological properties of 60 countries from 1971 to 2008. These countries are divided into three subgroups: low income group, middle income group and high income group countries. Firstly, a relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth is investigated by using the concept of hierarchical structure methods (minimal spanning tree (MST) and hierarchical tree (HT)). Secondly, we perform bootstrap techniques to investigate a value of the statistical reliability to the links of the MST. Finally, we use a clustering linkage procedure in order to observe the cluster structure more clearly. The results of the structural topologies of these trees are as follows: i) we identified different clusters of countries according to their geographical location and economic growth, ii) we found a strong relation between energy consumption and economic growth for all the income groups considered in this study and iii) the results are in good agreement with the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth.",2014-06-25T13:18:18Z,2014-06-27T05:06:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6562v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6562v2,q-fin.ST
Investigation of Electrical Conductivity Changes during Brain Functional   Activity in 3T MRI,"Kyu-Jin Jung, Chuanjiang Cui, Soo-Hyung Lee, Chan-Hee Park, Ji-Won Chun, Dong-Hyun Kim","Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to visualize brain activation regions by detecting hemodynamic responses associated with increased metabolic demand. While alternative MRI methods have been employed to monitor functional activities, the investigation of in-vivo electrical property changes during brain function remains limited. In this study, we explored the relationship between fMRI signals and electrical conductivity (measured at the Larmor frequency) changes using phase-based electrical properties tomography (EPT). Our results revealed consistent patterns: conductivity changes showed negative correlations, with conductivity decreasing in the functionally active regions whereas B1 phase mapping exhibited positive correlations around activation regions. These observations were consistent across both motor and visual cortex activations. To further substantiate these findings, we conducted electromagnetic radio-frequency simulations that modeled activation states with varying conductivity, which demonstrated trends similar to our in-vivo results for both B1 phase and conductivity. These findings suggest that in-vivo electrical conductivity changes can indeed be measured during brain activity. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms driving these measurements.",2024-09-12T07:34:44Z,2024-09-12T07:34:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07806v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07806v1,q-bio.QM

Modeling and Simulation of Regenerative Braking Energy in DC Electric   Rail Systems,"M. Khodaparastan, A. Mohamed","Regenerative braking energy is the energy produced by a train during deceleration. When a train decelerates, the motors act as generators and produce electricity. This energy can be fed back to the third rail and consumed by other trains accelerating nearby. If there are no nearby trains, this energy is dumped as heat to avoid over voltage. Regenerative braking energy can be saved by installing energy storage systems (ESS) and reused later when it is needed. To find a suitable design, size and placement of energy storage, a good understanding of this energy is required. The aim of this paper is to model and simulate regenerative braking energy.

The role of cellular coupling in the spontaneous generation of   electrical activity in uterine tissue,"Jinshan Xu, Shakti N. Menon, Rajeev Singh, Nicolas B. Garnier, Sitabhra Sinha, Alain Pumir","The spontaneous emergence of contraction-inducing electrical activity in the uterus at the beginning of labor remains poorly understood, partly due to the seemingly contradictory observation that isolated uterine cells are not spontaneously active. It is known, however, that the expression of gap junctions increases dramatically in the approach to parturition, which results in a significant increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling. In this paper, we build upon previous studies of the activity of electrically excitable smooth muscle cells (myocytes) and investigate the mechanism through which the coupling of these cells to electrically passive cells results in the generation of spontaneous activity in the uterus. Using a recently developed, realistic model of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a myocyte coupled to passive cells. We then extend our analysis to a simple two-dimensional lattice model of the tissue, with each myocyte being coupled to its neighbors, as well as to a random number of passive cells. We observe that different dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction conductances: at low coupling strength, the activity is confined to cell clusters, while the activity for high coupling may spread across the entire tissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous generation of spiral wave activity. Our results are both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with observations from in vitro experiments. In particular, we demonstrate that an increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling, for realistic parameter values, strongly facilitates the appearance of spontaneous action potentials that may eventually lead to parturition.",2014-09-18T13:24:24Z,2014-09-18T13:24:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5302v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5302v1,q-bio.TO
"Electrical Structure of Biological Cells and Tissues: impedance   spectroscopy, stereology, and singular perturbation theory",Robert Eisenberg,"Impedance Spectroscopy resolves electrical properties into uncorrelated variables, as a function of frequency, with exquisite resolution. Separation is robust and most useful when the system is linear. Impedance spectroscopy combined with appropriate structural knowledge provides insight into pathways for current flow, with more success than other methods. Biological applications of impedance spectroscopy are often not useful since so much of biology is strongly nonlinear in its essential features, and impedance spectroscopy is fundamentally a linear analysis. All cells and tissues have cell membranes and its capacitance is both linear and important to cell function. Measurements proved straightforward in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and lens of the eye. In skeletal muscle, measurements provided the best estimates of the predominant (cell) membrane system that dominates electrical properties. In cardiac muscle, measurements showed definitively that classical microelectrode voltage clamp could not control the potential of the predominant membranes, that were in the tubular system separated from the extracellular space by substantial distributed resistance. In the lens of the eye, impedance spectroscopy changed the basis of all recording and interpretation of electrical measurements and laid the basis for Rae and Mathias extensive later experimental work. Many tissues are riddled with extracellular space as clefts and tubules, for example, cardiac muscle, the lens of the eye, most epithelia, and of course frog muscle. These tissues are best analyzed with a bidomain theory that arose from the work on electrical structure described here. There has been a great deal of work since then on the bi-domain and this represents the most important contribution to biology of the analysis of electrical structure in my view.",2015-11-04T14:15:18Z,2015-11-04T14:15:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01339v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.01339v1,q-bio.QM
Extending integrate-and-fire model neurons to account for the effects of   weak electric fields and input filtering mediated by the dendrite,"Florian Aspart, Josef Ladenbauer, Klaus Obermayer","How extracellular electric fields, as generated endogenously or through transcranial brain stimulation, affect the dynamics of large neuronal populations is of great interest but not well understood. To study the collective dynamics of large populations single-compartment (point) model neurons have been proven very successful. These models, however, lack the dendritic morphology to biophysically account for the effects of electric fields, and for changes in synaptic integration due to morphology alone. Here we (i) characterize the response of a canonical spatial (ball-and-stick) model neuron to fluctuating synaptic input as well as an oscillatory, weak electric field, and (ii) analytically derive an extension for popular integrate-and-fire point neuron models to accurately reproduce these responses. We obtain distinct filters mediated by the dendrite for inputs at the soma (high-pass filter) or at the distal dendritic site (low-pass filter), and find that the electric field induces spike rate resonance in the beta and gamma frequency bands or even higher frequencies, depending on the location of synaptic background input. Due to their computational efficiency the extended point models are well suited for application in large populations of coupled neurons with different morphology, exposed to extracellular electric fields.",2016-03-15T20:44:36Z,2016-11-09T14:14:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04881v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04881v4,q-bio.NC
Electricity Consumption Forecasting for Smart Grid using the   Multi-Factor Back-Propagation Neural Network,"Hao Song, Yu Chen, Ning Zhou, Genshe Chen","With the development of modern information technology (IT), a smart grid has become one of the major components of smart cities. To take full advantage of the smart grid, the capability of intelligent scheduling and planning of electricity delivery is essential. In practice, many factors have an impact on electricity consumption, which necessitates information fusion technologies for a thorough understanding. For this purpose, researchers have investigated methodologies for collecting electricity consumption related information and variant multi-factor power consumption forecasting models. In addition, conducting a comprehensive analysis and obtaining an accurate evaluation of power consumption are the premise and basis for a more robust and efficient power grid design and transformation. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore forecasting models that are able to reflect the power consumption changes and internal relations within fusional information effectively. Making electricity consumption forecasting based on the neural network has been a popular research topic in recent years, and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm has been recognized as a mature and effective method. In this paper, BPNN is adopted to forecast the electricity consumption using Pecan Street, a community with a relatively large-scale smart grid, as a case study, and takes multiple factors into account, such as weather condition, weekend and holidays. The influences of each factor have been evaluated for a deeper insight. We hope this work will inspire more discussion and further study to guide the design of future smart grids.",2019-02-27T23:10:08Z,2019-02-27T23:10:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10823v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10823v1,eess.SP
A Comparison of Various Electricity Tariff Price Forecasting Techniques   in Turkey and Identifying the Impact of Time Series Periods,T. O. Benli,"It is very vital for suppliers and distributors to predict the deregulated electricity prices for creating their bidding strategies in the competitive market area. Pre requirement of succeeding in this field, accurate and suitable electricity tariff price forecasting tools are needed. In the presence of effective forecasting tools, taking the decisions of production, merchandising, maintenance and investment with the aim of maximizing the profits and benefits can be successively and effectively done. According to the electricity demand, there are four various electricity tariffs pricing in Turkey; monochromic, day, peak and night. The objective is find the best suitable tool for predicting the four pricing periods of electricity and produce short term forecasts (one year ahead-monthly). Our approach based on finding the best model, which ensures the smallest forecasting error measurements of: MAPE, MAD and MSD. We conduct a comparison of various forecasting approaches in total accounts for nine teen, at least all of those have different aspects of methodology. Our beginning step was doing forecasts for the year 2015. We validated and analyzed the performance of our best model and made comparisons to see how well the historical values of 2015 and forecasted data for that specific period matched. Results show that given the time-series data, the recommended models provided good forecasts. Second part of practice, we also include the year 2015, and compute all the models with the time series of January 2011 to December 2015. Again by choosing the best appropriate forecasting model, we conducted the forecast process and also analyze the impact of enhancing of time series periods (January 2007 to December 2015) to model that we used for forecasting process.",2016-08-18T07:16:08Z,2016-08-18T07:16:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08415v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08415v1,q-fin.ST
Using electrical impedance spectroscopy to identify equivalent circuit   models of lubricated contacts with complex geometry: in-situ application to   mini traction machine,"Min Yu, Jie Zhang, Arndt Joedicke, Tom Reddyhoff","Electrical contact resistance or capacitance as measured between a lubricated contact has been used in tribometers, partially reflecting the lubrication condition. In contrast, the electrical impedance provides rich information of magnitude and phase, which can be interpreted using equivalent circuit models, enabling more comprehensive measurements, including the variation of lubricant film thickness and the asperity (metal to metal) contact area. An accurate circuit model of the lubricated contact is critical as needed for the electrical impedance analysis. However, existing circuit models are hand derived and suited to interfaces with simple geometry, such as parallel plates, concentric and eccentric cylinders. Circuit model identification of lubricated contacts with complex geometry is challenging. This work takes the ball-on-disc lubricated contact in a Mini Traction Machine (MTM) as an example, where screws on the ball, grooves on the disc, and contact close to the disc edge make the overall interface geometry complicated. The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to capture its frequency response, with a group of load, speed, and temperature varied and tested separately. The results enable an identification of equivalent circuit models by fitting parallel resistor-capacitor models, the dependence on the oil film thickness is further calibrated using a high-accuracy optical interferometry, which is operated under the same lubrication condition as in the MTM. Overall, the proposed method is applicable to general lubricated interfaces for the identification of equivalent circuit models, which in turn facilitates in-situ tribo-contacts with electric impedance measurement of oil film thickness. It does not need transparent materials as optical techniques do, or structural modifications for piezoelectric sensor mounting as ultrasound techniques do.",2023-07-07T15:39:12Z,2023-07-07T15:39:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03668v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03668v1,eess.SP
Investigation of temperature stress tolerance in Arabidopsis STTM165/166   using electrophysiology and RNA-Seq,"Dongjie Zhao, Qinghui Chen, Ziyang Wang, Lucy Arbanas, Guiliang Tang","Plant electrical signals have been shown to be generated in response to various environmental stresses, but the relationship between these signals and stress tolerance is not well understood. In this study, we used the Arabidopsis STTM165/166 mutant, which exhibits enhanced temperature tolerance, to examine this relationship. Surface recording techniques were utilized to compare the generation ratio and duration characteristics of electrical signals in the STTM165/166 mutant and wild type (WT). Patch-clamp recording was employed to assess ion channel currents, specifically those of calcium ions. The current intensity of the mutant was found to be lower than that of the WT. As calcium ions are involved in the generation of plant electrical signals, we hypothesized that the reduced calcium channel activity in the mutant increased its electrical signal threshold. RNA-Seq analysis revealed differential expression of AHA genes in the STTM165/166 mutant, which may contribute to the prolonged depolarization phenotype. Gene Ontology enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified associations between these DEGs and various stresses, including temperature, salt, and those related to the jasmonic acid and abscisic acid pathways. These findings provide experimental evidence for the use of plant electrical signals in characterizing stress tolerance and explore potential ion mechanisms through patch-clamp recording and DEG Gene Ontology analysis. They also emphasize the need for further research on the relationship between plant electrical signals and stress tolerance.",2023-09-08T03:58:27Z,2023-09-08T03:58:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04107v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04107v1,q-bio.MN

How MTs handle and process electrical information, however, is heretofore unknown. Here we show new electrodynamic properties of MTs. Isolated, taxol-stabilized microtubules behave as bio-molecular transistors capable of amplifying electrical information.

By analyzing the noise in real and imaginary electrical impedance, we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish the two cell types purely from signatures of their electrical noise.

One key aspect of this process is the choice of the best modulation format. To this end, performance comparisons among several modulation formats against different physical constraints have been presented in literature and are still being carried out. In our contribution, we performed an exhaustive analysis on the impact of transceivers electrical frequency response shape on the performance of 2-levels pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-2), 4-levels PAM (PAM-4), electrical and optical duobinary modulation formats with adaptive equalizer at the receiver side. We show by means of numerical simulations that the specification of the typically used -3dB bandwidth is not sufficient, since also out-of-band electrical frequency response specifications (such as the -20dB bandwidth) has a huge impact on the performance of the analyzed modulation formats. The normalized graphs given at the end of the paper in terms of -3dB and -20 dB bandwidths can thus be useful for the design of the next generation of HS-PON transceivers.",2018-01-25T20:09:37Z,2018-01-25T20:09:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08584v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08584v1,eess.SP

Then, the value of the Reliability Option is simulated under a real-market calibration, using data of the Italian power market.

The Dynamic Shift of Neuron Excitability Observed with Enveloped High   Frequency Stimulation,"Jiahui Wang, Hao Wang, Xin Yuan Thow, Nitish V. Thakor","Neuronal excitability is known to be affected by transcranial electrical stimulation. However, due to the existence of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cortex, the mechanism of neuronal excitability shift is still not clear. Here, we study electrical stimulation disturbance on neuronal excitability in the neuromuscular system on an acute rat model. We design a special stimulation waveform of enveloped high frequency stimulation (EHFS). With modeling and in vivo measurements, EHFS is confirmed to synchronize the neuronal recruitment at the positive and negative electrode. This unique synchronization property of EHFS amplifies the electrical stimulation disturbance on neuronal excitability, to enable the macroscopic observations of large increase and decrease of force output. By eliminating the complicated inhibitory interneuron effects in the cortex, our observations on the neuromuscular system supports the argument that electrical stimulation dynamically shifts neuronal excitability, by inducing depolarization during anodal stimulation and hyperpolarization during cathodal stimulation.",2018-12-04T02:54:30Z,2019-08-22T03:46:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01179v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01179v3,q-bio.NC

In addition, bidirectional charging and improved connectivity enables efficient power grid support. Today, however, uncoordinated charging, e.g. governed by users' habits, is still the norm. Thus, the impact of upcoming smart charging applications is mostly unexplored. We aim to estimate the expenses inherent with smart charging, e.g. battery aging costs, and give suggestions for further research. Using typical on-board sensor data we concisely model and validate an EV battery. We then integrate the battery model into a realistic smart charging use case and compare it with measurements of real EV charging. The results show that i) the temperature dependence of battery aging requires precise thermal models for charging power greater than 7 kW, ii) disregarding battery aging underestimates EVs' operating costs by approx. 30%, and iii) the profitability of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) services based on bidirectional power flow, e.g. energy arbitrage, depends on battery aging costs and the electricity price spread.",2020-09-23T10:23:24Z,2021-04-29T07:14:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12201v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12201v2,eess.SP

Electricity Spot Prices Forecasting Using Stochastic Volatility Models,Andrei Renatovich Batyrov,"There are several approaches to modeling and forecasting time series as applied to prices of commodities and financial assets.

Automated pulse discrimination of two freely-swimming weakly electric   fish and analysis of their electrical behavior during a dominance contest,"Rafael Tuma Guariento, Thiago Schiavo Mosqueiro, Paulo Matias, Vinicius Burani Cesarino, Lirio Onofre Baptista de Almeida, Jan Frans Willem Slaets, Leonardo Paulo Maia, Reynaldo Daniel Pinto","Electric fishes modulate their electric organ discharges with a remarkable variability. Some patterns can be easily identified, such as pulse rate changes, offs and chirps, which are often associated with important behavioral contexts, including aggression, hiding and mating. However, these behaviors are only observed when at least two fish are freely interacting. Although their electrical pulses can be easily recorded by non-invasive techniques, discriminating the emitter of each pulse is challenging when physically similar fish are allowed to freely move and interact. Here we optimized a custom-made software recently designed to identify the emitter of pulses by using automated chirp detection, adaptive threshold for pulse detection and slightly changing how the recorded signals are integrated. With these optimizations, we performed a quantitative analysis of the statistical changes throughout the dominance contest with respect to Inter Pulse Intervals, Chirps and Offs dyads of freely moving Gymnotus carapo. In all dyads, chirps were signatures of subsequent submission, even when they occurred early in the contest. Although offs were observed in both dominant and submissive fish, they were substantially more frequent in submissive individuals, in agreement with the idea from previous studies that offs are electric cues of submission. In general, after the dominance is established the submissive fish significantly changes its average pulse rate, while the pulse rate of the dominant remained unchanged. Additionally, no chirps or offs were observed when two fish were manually kept in direct physical contact, suggesting that these electric behaviors are not automatic responses to physical contact.",2016-07-02T00:14:43Z,2017-03-22T14:38:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00437v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00437v2,q-bio.QM
The phase response of the cortical slow oscillation,"Arne Weigenand, Thomas Martinetz, Jens Christian Claussen","Cortical slow oscillations occur in the mammalian brain during deep sleep and have been shown to contribute to memory consolidation, an effect that can be enhanced by electrical stimulation. As the precise underlying working mechanisms are not known it is desired to develop and analyze computational models of slow oscillations and to study the response to electrical stimuli. In this paper we employ the conductance based model of Compte et al. [J Neurophysiol 89, 2707] to study the effect of electrical stimulation. The population response to electrical stimulation depends on the timing of the stimulus with respect to the state of the slow oscillation. First, we reproduce the experimental results of electrical stimulation in ferret brain slices by Shu et al. [Nature 423, 288] from the conductance based model. We then numerically obtain the phase response curve for the conductance based network model to quantify the network's response to weak stimuli. Our results agree with experiments in vivo and in vitro that show that sensitivity to stimulation is weaker in the up than in the down state. However, we also find that within the up state stimulation leads to a shortening of the up state, or phase advance, whereas during the up-down transition a prolongation of up states is possible, resulting in a phase delay. Finally, we compute the phase response curve for the simple mean-field model by Ngo et al. [Europhys Lett 89, 68002] and find that the qualitative shape of the PRC is preserved, despite its different mechanism for the generation of slow oscillations.",2013-12-30T15:15:28Z,2013-12-30T15:15:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7735v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.7735v1,q-bio.NC
Unveiling Stimulation Secrets of Electrical Excitation of Neural Tissue   Using a Circuit Probability Theory,"Hao Wang, Jiahui Wang, Xin Yuan Thow, Sanghoon Lee, Wendy Yen Xian Peh, Kian Ann Ng, Tianyiyi He, Nitish V. Thakor, Chengkuo Lee","A new theory, named the Circuit-Probability theory, is proposed to unveil the secret of electrical nerve stimulation, essentially explain the nonlinear and resonant phenomena observed when neural and non-neural tissues are electrically stimulated. For the explanation of frequency dependent response, an inductor is involved in the neural circuit model. Furthermore, predicted response to varied stimulation strength is calculated stochastically. Based on this theory, many empirical models, such as strength-duration relationship and LNP model, can be theoretically explained, derived, and amended. This theory can explain the complex nonlinear interactions in electrical stimulation and fit in vivo experiment data on stimulation-responses of many experiments. As such, the C-P theory should be able to guide novel experiments and more importantly, offer an in-depth physical understanding of the neural tissue. As a promising neural model, we can even further explore the more accurate circuit configuration and probability equation to better describe the electrical stimulation of neural tissues in the future.",2018-04-30T16:34:08Z,2018-06-14T06:01:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11310v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11310v2,q-bio.NC
Potential utilization of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in the   major European electricity markets,"Yu Hu, Miguel Armada, Maria Jesus Sanchez","Given the declining cost of battery technology in the last decade, nowadays BESS becomes a more attractive solution in electrical power systems. The objective of this work is to analyze the potential utilization of BESS in the major European electricity markets. A general payoff model for BESS operation is proposed to correctly address the operational flexibility of battery systems. Utilization factors such as potentially profitable utilization time and rate are calculated for common applications including energy arbitrage and frequency support services using real market information. The result shows that under the current empirical estimation of the battery cost and lifetime, BESS is not feasible for energy arbitrage in most of the European electricity markets. However, BESS shows clearly and significantly higher potential in providing frequency support services. The result suggests that, when the frequency containment reserve is remunerable, the potentially profitable utilization of BESS has become already accretive in most of the European countries. For example from January to September 2021, the potentially profitable utilization rate has reached almost 100% for the FCR-N service in the Danish market. Comparing the regional electricity markets in Europe, BESS has shown significant potential in becoming a feasible solution in Central Western Europe and parts of Northern Europe by providing frequency regulation services. Meanwhile, in the British Isles and some other islanded local markets, a remarkable level of scarcity of flexibility has been revealed by the investigation, and the potential of BESS would also be considerably encouraging.",2021-12-18T01:36:10Z,2022-06-22T14:07:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09816v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09816v2,q-fin.GN
A Robust Statistical Analysis of the Role of Hydropower on the System   Electricity Price and Price Volatility,"Olukunle O. Owolabi, Kathryn Lawson, Sanhita Sengupta, Yingsi Huang, Lan Wang, Chaopeng Shen, Mila Getmansky Sherman, Deborah A. Sunter","Hydroelectric power (hydropower) is unique in that it can function as both a conventional source of electricity and as backup storage (pumped hydroelectric storage) for providing energy in times of high demand on the grid. This study examines the impact of hydropower on system electricity price and price volatility in the region served by the New England Independent System Operator (ISONE) from 2014 - 2020. We perform a robust holistic analysis of the mean and quantile effects, as well as the marginal contributing effects of hydropower in the presence of solar and wind resources. First, the price data is adjusted for deterministic temporal trends, correcting for seasonal, weekend, and diurnal effects that may obscure actual representative trends in the data. Using multiple linear regression and quantile regression, we observe that hydropower contributes to a reduction in the system electricity price and price volatility. While hydropower has a weak impact on decreasing price and volatility at the mean, it has greater impact at extreme quantiles (> 70th percentile). At these higher percentiles, we find that hydropower provides a stabilizing effect on price volatility in the presence of volatile resources such as wind. We conclude with a discussion of the observed relationship between hydropower and system electricity price and volatility.",2022-03-04T01:58:13Z,2022-03-04T01:58:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02089v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02089v1,q-fin.GN
A Comparative Study of Factor Models for Different Periods of the   Electricity Spot Price Market,"Christian Laudagé, Florian Aichinger, Sascha Desmettre","Due to major shifts in European energy supply, a structural change can be observed in Austrian electricity spot price data starting from the second quarter of the year 2021 onward. In this work we study the performance of two different factor models for the electricity spot price in three different time periods. To this end, we consider three samples of EEX data for the Austrian base load electricity spot price, one from the pre-crises from 2018 to 2021, the second from the time of the crisis from 2021 to 2023 and the whole data from 2018 to 2023. For each of these samples, we investigate the fit of a classical 3-factor model with a Gaussian base signal and one positive and one negative jump signal and compare it with a 4-factor model to assess the effect of adding a second Gaussian base signal to the model. For the calibration of the models we develop a tailor-made Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Gibbs sampling. To evaluate the model adequacy, we provide simulations of the spot price as well as a posterior predictive check for the 3- and the 4-factor model. We find that the 4-factor model outperforms the 3-factor model in times of non-crises. In times of crises, the second Gaussian base signal does not lead to a better fit of the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding stochastic electricity spot price models in this new market environment. Hence, it serves as a solid base for future research.",2023-06-13T12:38:15Z,2024-04-22T18:02:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07731v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07731v3,"q-fin.MF, q-fin.RM"
A New Time Series Similarity Measure and Its Smart Grid Applications,"Rui Yuan, S. Ali Pourmousavi, Wen L. Soong, Andrew J. Black, Jon A. R. Liisberg, Julian Lemos-Vinasco","Many smart grid applications involve data mining, clustering, classification, identification, and anomaly detection, among others. These applications primarily depend on the measurement of similarity, which is the distance between different time series or subsequences of a time series. The commonly used time series distance measures, namely Euclidean Distance (ED) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), do not quantify the flexible nature of electricity usage data in terms of temporal dynamics. As a result, there is a need for a new distance measure that can quantify both the amplitude and temporal changes of electricity time series for smart grid applications, e.g., demand response and load profiling. This paper introduces a novel distance measure to compare electricity usage patterns. The method consists of two phases that quantify the effort required to reshape one time series into another, considering both amplitude and temporal changes. The proposed method is evaluated against ED and DTW using real-world data in three smart grid applications. Overall, the proposed measure outperforms ED and DTW in accurately identifying the best load scheduling strategy, anomalous days with irregular electricity usage, and determining electricity users' behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment.",2023-10-19T01:02:47Z,2023-10-19T01:02:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12399v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12399v1,"eess.SP, eess.AS"
"Mode-locked laser timing jitter limitation in optically enabled,   spectrally sliced ADCs","Andrea Zazzi, Juliana Müller, Sergiy Gudyriev, Pablo Marin-Palomo, Dengyang Fang, J. Christoph Scheytt, Christian Koos, Jeremy Witzens","Novel analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architectures are motivated by the demand for rising sampling rates and effective number of bits (ENOB). The main limitation on ENOB in purely electrical ADCs lies in the relatively high jitter of oscillators, in the order of a few tens of fs for state-of-the-art components. When compared to the extremely low jitter obtained with best-in-class Ti:sapphire mode-locked lasers (MLL), in the attosecond range, it is apparent that a mixed electrical-optical architecture could significantly improve the converters' ENOB. We model and analyze the ENOB limitations arising from optical sources in optically enabled, spectrally sliced ADCs, after discussing the system architecture and implementation details. The phase noise of the optical carrier, serving for electro-optic signal transduction, is shown not to propagate to the reconstructed digitized signal and therefore not to represent a fundamental limit. The optical phase noise of the MLL used to generate reference tones for individual slices also does not fundamentally impact the converted signal, so long as it remains correlated among all the comb lines. On the other hand, the timing jitter of the MLL, as also reflected in its RF linewidth, is fundamentally limiting the ADC performance, since it is directly mapped as jitter to the converted signal. The hybrid nature of a photonically enabled, spectrally sliced ADC implies the utilization of a number of reduced bandwidth electrical ADCs to convert parallel slices, resulting in the propagation of jitter from the electrical oscillator supplying their clock. Due to the reduced sampling rate of the electrical ADCs, as compared to the overall system, the overall noise performance of the presented architecture is substantially improved with respect to a fully electrical ADC.",2020-04-13T09:24:00Z,2020-04-13T09:24:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05836v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05836v1,eess.SP

Modeling the Heart as a Communication System,"Hiroshi Ashikaga, José Aguilar-Rodríguez, Shai Gorsky, Elizabeth Lusczek, Flávia Maria Darcie Marquitti, Brian Thompson, Degang Wu, Joshua Garland","Electrical communication between cardiomyocytes can be perturbed during arrhythmia, but these perturbations are not captured by conventional electrocardiographic metrics. We developed a theoretical framework to quantify electrical communication using information theory metrics in 2-dimensional cell lattice models of cardiac excitation propagation. The time series generated by each cell was coarse-grained to 1 when excited or 0 when resting. The Shannon entropy for each cell was calculated from the time series during four clinically important heart rhythms: normal heartbeat, anatomical reentry, spiral reentry, and multiple reentry. We also used mutual information to perform spatial profiling of communication during these cardiac arrhythmias. We found that information sharing between cells was spatially heterogeneous. In addition, cardiac arrhythmia significantly impacted information sharing within the heart. Entropy localized the path of the drifting core of spiral reentry, which could be an optimal target of therapeutic ablation. We conclude that information theory metrics can quantitatively assess electrical communication among cardiomyocytes. The traditional concept of the heart as a functional syncytium sharing electrical information cannot predict altered entropy and information sharing during complex arrhythmia. Information theory metrics may find clinical application in the identification of rhythm-specific treatments which are currently unmet by traditional electrocardiographic techniques.",2014-10-08T15:36:11Z,2014-10-31T19:55:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2169v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2169v2,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.TO"
Improving Short-Term Electricity Price Forecasting Using Day-Ahead LMP   with ARIMA Models,"Zhongyang Zhao, Caisheng Wang, Matthew Nokleby, Carol Miller","Short-term electricity price forecasting has become important for demand side management and power generation scheduling. Especially as the electricity market becomes more competitive, a more accurate price prediction than the day-ahead locational marginal price (DALMP) published by the independent system operator (ISO) will benefit participants in the market by increasing profit or improving load demand scheduling. Hence, the main idea of this paper is to use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to obtain a better LMP prediction than the DALMP by utilizing the published DALMP, historical real-time LMP (RTLMP) and other useful information. First, a set of seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models utilizing the DALMP and historical RTLMP are developed and compared with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models that use the differences between DALMP and RTLMP on their forecasting capability. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is implemented to further improve the forecasting by accounting for the price volatility. The models are trained and evaluated using real market data in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The evaluation results indicate that the ARMAX-GARCH model, where an exogenous time series indicates weekend days, improves the short-term electricity price prediction accuracy and outperforms the other proposed ARIMA models",2018-01-04T20:24:22Z,2018-01-04T20:24:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02485v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02485v1,eess.SP
Performance Degradation Assessment for Electrical Machines Based on SOM   and Hybrid DHMM,"Chong Bian, Shunkun Yang, Tingting Huang, Qingyang Xu, Jie Liu, Enrico Zio","Aimed at the timely detection of the degradation of electrical machines and the organization of active maintenance, numerous studies on performance degradation assessment have been conducted. However, previous research still suffers from two deficiencies: 1) determining the relevant relationship among diverse machine degradation states and assessing the specific degree of deterioration and 2) determining the evolutionary relationships among degradation and failure modes and assessing the failure modes corresponding to different degradation scenarios. To address these two deficiencies, a novel performance degradation assessment method is proposed. First, the self-organizing feature map (SOM) network is used to mine the latent degradation states of electrical machines. Second, the latent states are quantified according to established statistical health indexes, and by analyzing the distribution of extracted health indexes corresponding to different degradation states, the relevant transition relationships of the valid degradation states and the final evolving fault types are determined. Third, a hybrid discrete HMM is developed to fully describe the transition process among different states and assess the degradation scenario of a machine in an online manner.

Modeling the stylized facts of wholesale system marginal price (SMP) and   the impacts of regulatory reforms on the Greek Electricity Market,"G. Papaioannou, P. Papaioannou, N.

SMP is considered here as the footprint of an underline stochastic and nonlinear process that bears all the information reflecting not only the effects of changes in endogenous or fundamental factors of the market but also the impacts of a series of regulatory reforms that have continuously changed the market's microstructure. To capture the dynamics of the conditional mean and volatility of SMP that generate the stylized facts(mean reversion, price spikes, fat tails price distribution etc), a number of ARMAX GARCH models have been estimated using as regressors an extensive set of fundamental factors in the Greek electricity market as well as dummy variables that mimic the history of Regulator's interventions. The findings show that changes in the microstructure of the market caused by the reforms have strongly affected the dynamic evolution of SMP and that the best found model captures adequately the stylized facts of the series that other electricity and financial markets share.

Band power modulation through intracranial EEG stimulation and its   cross-session consistency,"Christoforos A Papasavvas, Gabrielle M Schroeder, Beate Diehl, Gerold Baier, Peter N Taylor, Yujiang Wang","Background: Direct electrical stimulation of the brain through intracranial electrodes is currently used to probe the epileptic brain as part of pre-surgical evaluation, and it is also being considered for therapeutic treatments through neuromodulation. It is still unknown, however, how consistent intracranial direct electrical stimulation responses are across sessions, to allow effective neuromodulation design.   Objective: To investigate the cross-session consistency of the electrophysiological effect of electrical stimulation delivered through intracranial EEG.   Methods: We analysed data from 79 epilepsy patients implanted with intracranial EEG who underwent brain stimulation as part of a memory experiment. We quantified the effect of stimulation in terms of band power modulation and compared this effect from session to session. As a reference, we applied the same measures during baseline periods.   Results: In most sessions, the effect of stimulation on band power could not be distinguished from baseline fluctuations of band power. Stimulation effect was also not consistent across sessions; only a third of the session pairs had a higher consistency than the baseline standards. Cross-session consistency is mainly associated with the strength of positive stimulation effects, and it also tends to be higher when the baseline conditions are more similar between sessions.

Integrating such energy system models results in increased system complexity. This complexity poses a challenge for energy modellers to address multiple uncertainties that affect both markets. Stochastic optimisation approaches enable an adequate consideration of uncertainties in investment and operation planning; however, stochastic modelling of integrated large-scale energy systems further scales the level of complexity.

ECG-Based Blood Pressure Estimation Using Mechano-Electric Coupling   Concept,"Seyedeh Somayyeh Mousavi, Mostafa Charmi, Mohammad Firouzmand, Mohammad Hemmati, Maryam Moghadam, Yadollah Ghorbani","The Electrocardiograph signal represents the heart's electrical activity while blood pressure results from the heart's mechanical activity. Previous studies have investigated how the heart's electrical and mechanical activities are related and have referred to their relationship as the Mechano-Electric Coupling term. A new method to estimate the blood pressure including is proposed which uses only the Electrocardiograph signal. In spite of studies performed on feature extraction based on the signals' physiological parameters (Parameter-based), in this work, the feature vectors are formed with samples of the Electrocardiograph signal in a particular time frame (Whole-based) and these vectors are input into Adaptive Boosting Regression to estimate blood pressure. The nonlinear relationship which correlates blood pressure with the Electrocardiograph signal is concluded by the results of this study. According to the results, the used algorithms, for estimating both diastolic blood pressures and mean arterial pressure, are in compliance with the standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Also, according to the British Hypertension Society standard, estimating diastolic blood pressures and mean arterial pressure with the proposed method attain an A grade while it achieves B for systolic blood pressure.

The role of gap junctions and clustered connectivity in emergent   synchronisation patterns of inhibitory neuronal networks,"Hélène Todd, Alex Cayco-Gajic, Boris Gutkin","Inhibitory interneurons, ubiquitous in the central nervous system, form networks connected through both chemical synapses and gap junctions. These networks are essential for regulating the activity of principal neurons, especially by inducing temporally patterned dynamic states. We aim to understand the dynamic mechanisms for synchronisation in networks of electrically and chemically coupled interneurons. We use the exact mean-field reduction to derive a neural mass model for both homogeneous and clustered networks. We first analyse a single population of neurons to understand how the two couplings interact with one another. We demonstrate that the network transitions from an asynchronous to a synchronous regime either by increasing the strength of the gap junction connectivity or the strength of the background input current. Conversely, the strength of inhibitory synapses affects the population firing rate, suggesting that electrical and chemical coupling strengths act as complementary mechanisms by which networks can tune synchronous oscillatory behavior. In line with previous work, we confirm that the depolarizing spikelet is crucial for the emergence of synchrony. Furthermore, find that the fast frequency component of the spikelet ensures robustness to heterogeneity. Next, inspired by the existence of multiple interconnected interneuron subtypes in the cerebellum, we analyse networks consisting of two clusters of cell types defined by differing chemical versus electrical coupling strengths. We show that breaking the electrical and chemical coupling symmetry between these clusters induces bistability, so that a transient external input can switch the network between synchronous and asynchronous firing. Together, our results shows the variety of cell-intrinsic and network properties that contribute to synchronisation of interneuronal networks with multiple types of coupling.",2024-02-22T14:45:22Z,2024-02-22T14:45:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14592v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14592v1,q-bio.NC
Random Walks for Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity,"Alan Williams, Todd K. Leen, Patrick D. Roberts","Random walk methods are used to calculate the moments of negative image equilibrium distributions in synaptic weight dynamics governed by spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The neural architecture of the model is based on the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of mormyrid electric fish, which forms a negative image of the reafferent signal from the fish's own electric discharge to optimize detection of sensory electric fields. Of particular behavioral importance to the fish is the variance of the equilibrium postsynaptic potential in the presence of noise, which is determined by the variance of the equilibrium weight distribution. Recurrence relations are derived for the moments of the equilibrium weight distribution, for arbitrary postsynaptic potential functions and arbitrary learning rules. For the case of homogeneous network parameters, explicit closed form solutions are developed for the covariances of the synaptic weight and postsynaptic potential distributions.",2003-12-23T22:10:43Z,2003-12-23T22:10:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0312038v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0312038v1,q-bio.NC
Biophysical analysis of electric current mediated nucleoprotein   inactivation process,"Jose E. Gonzalez, Robersy Sanchez, Aminael Sanchez","Motivation: Its well known the use of electric current in the cleaning of viral diseases in plants instead a deep knowledge of this phenomenas theoretical basis is not yet available. The description of the real causes of nucleoprotein inactivation, will contribute to the optimization of further experiments in order to obtain more and more efficient cleaning methodologies for starting material supplies of vegetal species micropropagation process. The dissipated energy as heat will depend on the specific treatment applied and on the physical properties of the vegetal tissue and viral nucleoprotein. Results: A hyperbolic dependence between the absorbance output values, obtained during a diagnostic micro-ELISA experiment, and the electrical power (in watts) applied to each explant was found. The former, demonstrate the cleaning process nature is essentially the effect over viral nucleoprotein denaturation, by means of the heat, to which they were exposed in the thermal bath that the vegetal tissue constitutes.

Synchronization in Electrically Coupled Neural Networks,"Rajesh G Kavasseri, Radhakrishnan Nagarajan","In this report, we investigate the synchronization of temporal activity in an electrically coupled neural network model. The electrical coupling is established by homotypic static gap-junctions (Connexin 43). Two distinct network topologies, namely: {\em sparse random network, (SRN)} and {\em fully connected network, (FCN)} are used to establish the connectivity. The strength of connectivity in the FCN is governed by the {\em mean gap junctional conductance} ($\mu$). In the case of the SRN, the overall strength of connectivity is governed by the {\em density of connections} ($\delta$) and the connection strength between two neurons ($S_0$). The synchronization of the network with increasing gap junctional strength and varying population sizes is investigated. It was observed that the network {\em abruptly} makes a transition from a weakly synchronized to a well synchronized regime when ($\delta$) or ($\mu$) exceeds a critical value. It was also observed that the ($\delta$, $\mu$) values used to achieve synchronization decreases with increasing network size.",2006-03-29T21:35:42Z,2006-03-29T21:35:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0603035v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0603035v1,q-bio.NC
Macrodipoles of potassium and chloride ion channels as revealed by   electronic structure calculations,Fabio Pichierri,"With the aid of quantum mechanical calculations we investigate the electronic structure of the full length (FL) potassium channel protein, FL-KcsA, in its closed conformation, and the electronic structure of the ClC chloride channel. The results indicate that both ion channels are strongly polarized towards the extracellular region with respect to the membrane mean plane. FL-KcsA possesses an electric dipole moment of magnitude 403 Debye while ClC has a macrodipole whose magnitude is about five times larger, 1983 Debye, thereby contributing to differentiate their membrane electric barriers. The dipole vectors of both proteins are aligned along the corresponding selectivity filters. This result suggests that potassium and chloride ion channels are not passive with respect to the movement of ions across the membrane and the ionic motion might be partially driven by the electric field of the protein in conjunction with the electrochemical potential of the membrane.",2009-12-11T02:34:43Z,2009-12-11T02:34:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2141v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.2141v1,q-bio.BM
Estimation of the number of biophotons involved in the visual perception   of a single-object image: Biophoton intensity can be considerably higher   inside cells than outside,"I. Bokkon, V. Salari, J. Tuszynski, I. Antal","Recently, we have proposed a redox molecular hypothesis about the natural biophysical substrate of visual perception and imagery (B\'okkon, 2009. BioSystems; B\'okkon and D'Angiulli, 2009. Bioscience Hypotheses). Namely, the retina transforms external photon signals into electrical signals that are carried to the V1 (striate cortex). Then, V1 retinotopic electrical signals (spike-related electrical signals along classical axonal-dendritic pathways) can be converted into regulated ultraweak bioluminescent photons (biophotons) through redox processes within retinotopic visual neurons that make it possible to create intrinsic biophysical pictures during visual perception and imagery. However, the consensus opinion is to consider biophotons as by-products of cellular metabolism. This paper argues that biophotons are not by-products, other than originating from regulated cellular radical/redox processes. It also shows that the biophoton intensity can be considerably higher inside cells than outside. Our simple calculations, within a level of accuracy, suggest that the real biophoton intensity in retinotopic neurons may be sufficient for creating intrinsic biophysical picture representation of a single-object image during visual perception.",2010-12-16T14:43:29Z,2010-12-16T14:43:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3625v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3625v1,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.SC"
Mathematical modelling of the electric sense of fish: the role of   multi-frequency measurements and movement,"Habib Ammari, Thomas Boulier, Josselin Garnier, Han Wang","Understanding active electrolocation in weakly electric fish remains a challenging issue. In this article we propose a mathematical formulation of this problem, in terms of partial differential equations. This allows us to detail two algorithms: one for localizing a target using the multi-frequency aspect of the signal, and antoher one for identifying the shape of this target. Shape recognition is designed in a machine learning point of view, and take advantage of both the multi-frequency setup and the movement of the fish around its prey. Numerical simulations are shown for the computation of the electric field emitted and sensed by the fish; they are then used as an input for the two algorithms.",2016-12-09T09:53:55Z,2016-12-09T09:53:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03168v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03168v1,q-bio.TO

Risk Constrained Trading Strategies for Stochastic Generation with a   Single-Price Balancing Market,Jethro Browell,"Due to the limited predictability of wind power and other stochastic generation, trading this energy in competitive electricity markets is challenging. This paper derives revenue-maximising and risk-constrained strategies for stochastic generators participating in electricity markets with a single-price balancing mechanism. Starting from the optimal---and impractical---strategy of offering zero or nominal power, which exposes the participant to potentially large imbalance costs, we develop a number of strategies that control risk by hedging against penalising balancing prices in favour of rewarding ones. Trading strategies are formulated in a probabilistic framework in order to address asymmetry in balancing prices. The large-scale communication of system information characteristic of modern power systems is utilised to inputs for electricity price forecasts and probabilistic system length forecasts. A case study using data from the GB market in the UK is presented and the ability of the proposed strategies to increase revenue and reduce risk is demonstrated and analysed.",2017-06-23T13:14:20Z,2017-06-23T13:14:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02625v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02625v1,"q-fin.GN, q-fin.ST"

Noninvasive Blockade of Action Potential by Electromagnetic Induction,"Soheil Hashemi, Amirhossein Hajiaghajani, Ali Abdolali","Conventional anesthesia methods such as injective anesthetic agents may cause various side effects such as injuries, allergies, and infections. We aim to investigate a noninvasive scheme of an electromagnetic radiator system to block action potential (AP) in neuron fibers. We achieved a high-gradient and unipolar tangential electric field by designing circular geometric coils on an electric rectifier filter layer. An asymmetric sawtooth pulse shape supplied the coils in order to create an effective blockage. The entire setup was placed 5 cm above 50 motor and sensory neurons of the spinal cord. A validated time-domain full-wave analysis code Based on cable model of the neurons and the electric and magnetic potentials is used to simulate and investigate the proposed scheme.

Functional Intrusive Load Monitor (FILM): A Model-based Platform for   Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring System Development,"Mengqi Lu, Jinfeng Gao, Zuyi Li","Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an important application to monitor household appliance activities and provide related information to house owner or/and utility company via a single sensor installed at the electrical entry of the house. It can be used for different purposes in residential and industrial sectors. Thus, an increasing number of new algorithms have been developed in recent years. In these algorithms, researchers either use existing public datasets or collect their own data which causes such problems as insufficiency of electrical parameters, missing of ground-truth data, absence of many appliances, and lack of appliance information. To solve these problems, this paper presents a model-based platform for NILM system development, namely Functional Intrusive Load Monitor (FILM). By using this platform, the state transitions and activities of all the involved appliances can be preset by researchers, and multiple electrical parameters such as harmonics and power factor can be monitored or calculated. This platform will help researchers save the time of collecting experimental data, utilize precise control of individual appliance activities, and develop load signatures of devices. This paper describes the steps, structure, and requirements of building this platform.

Regression Based Approach for Measurement of Current in Single-Phase   Smart Energy Meter,"Shashank Singh, Arun S L, Selvan M P","In the present scenario rate of utilization of electrical energy is continuously increasing, to preserve the non-renewable energy resources, efficient consumption of electrical energy is one of the most important needs of this era. Smart Energy Meter (SEM) plays a vital role in efficient use of electrical energy in consumer premises. Accuracy in the measurement of current is one of the key factors to be considered while measuring energy consumption. This paper introduces Arduino based low cost single-phase SEM and proposes a linear regression based technique for accurate measurement of current. The proposed current measurement approach gives accurate measurement for linear as well as highly non-linear loads.

Validating Clustering Frameworks for Electric Load Demand Profiles,"Mayank Jain, Tarek AlSkaif, Soumyabrata Dev","Large-scale deployment of smart meters has made it possible to collect sufficient and high-resolution data of residential electric demand profiles. Clustering analysis of these profiles is important to further analyze and comment on electricity consumption patterns. Although many clustering techniques have been proposed in the literature over the years, it is often noticed that different techniques fit best for different datasets. To identify the most suitable technique, standard clustering validity indices are often used. These indices focus primarily on the intrinsic characteristics of the clustering results. Moreover, different indices often give conflicting recommendations which can only be clarified with heuristics about the dataset and/or the expected cluster structures -- information that is rarely available in practical situations. This paper presents a novel scheme to validate and compare the clustering results objectively. Additionally, the proposed scheme considers all the steps prior to the clustering algorithm, including the pre-processing and dimensionality reduction steps, in order to provide recommendations over the complete framework. Accordingly, the proposed strategy is shown to provide better, unbiased, and uniform recommendations as compared to the standard Clustering Validity Indices.",2021-02-26T19:48:15Z,2021-02-26T19:48:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00030v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00030v1,eess.SP
Prefrontal cortex functional connectivity based on simultaneous record   of electrical and hemodynamic responses associated with mental stress,Fares Al-Shargie,This paper investigates prefrontal cortex (PFC) functional connectivity based on synchronized electrical and hemodynamic responses associated with mental stress. The electrical response was based on alpha rhythmic of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and the hemodynamic responses were based on the mean concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin measured using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The aim is to explore the effects of stress on the inter and intra hemispheric PFC functional connectivity at narrow and wide frequency bands with 8- 13 Hz in EEG and 0.009-0.1Hz in fNIRS signals. The results demonstrated significantly reduce in the functional connectivity on the dorsolateral PFC within the inter and intra hemispheric PFC areas based in EEG alpha rhythmic and fNIRS oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.

Locational Marginal Pricing: Towards a Free Market in Power,Martin Higgins,"Nothing has done more to empower the free market, enterprise, and meritocracy than the spread of electricity and power to everyone. The power system has been the precursor to the greatest period of innovation in our history and has meant that visionaries with revolutionary ideas can compete with those with capital, political power, and means. Electricity, therefore, has been the great equalising force of the last 150 years, enhancing the productivity of the masses and granting prosperity to whole swathes of our nation. Whilst electricity has been one of the single largest innovations in enhancing the power of free markets, it is somewhat ironic that the way power is sold to consumers is largely unfree. The market is highly regulated, centralised, and is often used for political football by cynical politicians on both sides of the political spectrum. Introducing Locational Marginal Pricing into the UK grid system will increase economic freedom in the consumer markets for power, reduce prices for the poorest in the UK, decrease transmission losses, increase the permeation of low carbon generation in the grid, and incentivise investment in the UK's Northern Powerhouse initiative.",2021-03-05T09:57:36Z,2021-03-05T09:57:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10937v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10937v1,q-fin.GN

In this paper a novel algorithm is introduced based on finite sample points to determine probabilistic density function of probabilistic distribution power flow results. A modified probabilistic charging behavior of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles at charging stations and their overlap with residential peak load is evaluated in probabilistic distribution power flow problem. The proposed algorithm is faster than Monte Carlo Simulation and at the same time keeps adequate accuracy.

However, non-convexities in these markets cause conflicts between the actions that the bidders want to take and the actual market results. In this work, we investigate the non-convex market clearing problem of Turkish market operator and propose three different rule sets. The first rule set allows both rejection of bids with positive surplus and acceptance of bids with negative surplus. The second and the third sets only allow one of these conflicted cases.
