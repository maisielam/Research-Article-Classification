Quantum controllers for quantum systems,Seth Lloyd,"This paper discusses fully coherent quantum feedback control, in which the sensors, controller, and actuators are quantum systems and interact coherently with the system to be controlled: as a result, the entire feedback loop is coherent. Unlike conventional semiclassical feedback control of quantum systems, feedback control by quantum controllers is not stochastic, preserves the initial state of the controlled system, and can control quantum systems in ways that are not possible using conventional, incoherent feedback control. In particular, the target state to which the quantum controller drives the system can be entangled with another quantum system. This paper investigates quantum controllers and states necessary and sufficient conditions for a Hamiltonian quantum system to be observable and controllable by a quantum controller.",1997-03-23T20:54:50Z,1997-03-23T20:54:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9703042v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9703042v1,quant-ph

Linear time logic control of linear systems with disturbances,"Jinjin Zhang, Zhaohui Zhu, Jianfei Yang","The formal analysis and design of control systems is one of recent trends in control theory. In this area, in order to reduce the complexity and scale of control systems, finite abstractions of control systems are introduced and explored. In non-disturbance case, the controller of control systems is often generated from the controller of finite abstractions. Recently, Pola and Tabuada provide approximate finite abstractions for linear control systems with disturbance inputs. However, these finite abstractions and original linear systems do not always share the identical specifications, which obstructs designing controller (of linear systems) based on their finite abstractions. This paper tries to bridge such gap between linear systems and their finite abstractions.",2012-12-29T10:30:53Z,2012-12-29T10:30:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6610v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.6610v1,math.OC

Extremum Seeking for Stabilization of Systems Not Affine in Control,"Alexander Scheinker, David Scheinker","In [22] a form of extremum seeking for control (ESC) was developed for the stabilization of uncertain nonlinear systems. In ESC the extremum seeker itself controls the systems through feedback rather than fine tuning a controller. The ESC results, and other related results, apply only to systems affine in control.

Central to our approach is the novel notion of safe period, which enforces a strong safety guarantee for implementing ZOH control.

Artificial neural networks are used to create controllers that are sequentially integrated into a control system with control objects. Reinforcement learning and pre-building a neural network imitator of the control object are used to synthesize the neural network controller. This approach is particularly effective when classical control system synthesis methods are not applicable due to significant nonlinearity and the difficulty in forming a mathematical model of the control object with the required accuracy. The proposed methods expand the class of technical systems for which direct synthesis of near-optimal control laws is possible.

Neural Koopman Lyapunov Control,"Vrushabh Zinage, Efstathios Bakolas","Learning and synthesizing stabilizing controllers for unknown nonlinear control systems is a challenging problem for real-world and industrial applications. Koopman operator theory allows one to analyze nonlinear systems through the lens of linear systems and nonlinear control systems through the lens of bilinear control systems. The key idea of these methods lies in the transformation of the coordinates of the nonlinear system into the Koopman observables, which are coordinates that allow the representation of the original system (control system) as a higher dimensional linear (bilinear control) system. However, for nonlinear control systems, the bilinear control model obtained by applying Koopman operator based learning methods is not necessarily stabilizable. Simultaneous identification of stabilizable lifted bilinear control systems as well as the associated Koopman observables is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct these stabilizable bilinear models and identify its associated observables from data by simultaneously learning a bilinear Koopman embedding for the underlying unknown control affine nonlinear system as well as a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) for the Koopman based bilinear model using a learner and falsifier. Our proposed approach thereby provides provable guarantees of asymptotic stability for the Koopman based representation of the unknown control affine nonlinear control system as a bilinear system.

In this paper, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system's state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs. Finally, we verify the validity of our proposed scheme through simulations.",2024-03-20T07:10:22Z,2024-10-20T06:18:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13346v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13346v3,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Data-driven control of input-affine systems: the role of the signature   transform,"Anna Scampicchio, Melanie N. Zeilinger","One of the most challenging tasks in control theory is arguably the design of a regulator for nonlinear systems when the dynamics are unknown. To tackle it, a popular strategy relies on finding a direct map between system responses and the controller, and the key ingredient is a predictor for system outputs trained on past trajectories. Focusing on continuous-time, input-affine systems, we show that the so-called signature transform provides rigorous and practically effective features to represent and predict system trajectories. Building upon such a tool, we propose a novel signature-based control strategy that is promising in view of data-driven predictive control.",2024-09-09T14:58:23Z,2024-09-09T14:58:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05685v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05685v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Controllability transition and nonlocality in network control,"Jie Sun, Adilson E. Motter","A common goal in the control of a large network is to minimize the number of driver nodes or control inputs. Yet, the physical determination of control signals and the properties of the resulting control trajectories remain widely under-explored. Here we show that: (i) numerical control fails in practice even for linear systems if the controllability Gramian is ill-conditioned, which occurs frequently even when existing controllability criteria are satisfied unambiguously; (ii) the control trajectories are generally nonlocal in the phase space, and their lengths are strongly anti-correlated with the numerical success rate and number of control inputs; (iii) numerical success rate increases abruptly from zero to nearly one as the number of control inputs is increased, a transformation we term numerical controllability transition. This reveals a trade-off between nonlocality of the control trajectory in the phase space and nonlocality of the control inputs in the network itself. The failure of numerical control cannot be overcome in general by merely increasing numerical precision---successful control requires instead increasing the number of control inputs beyond the numerical controllability transition.",2013-05-24T20:03:07Z,2013-05-24T20:03:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5848v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5848v1,"cond-mat.dis-nn, math.OC, nlin.AO"
Data-Driven Subsynchronous Oscillation Suppression for Renewable Energy   Integrated Power Systems Based on Koopman Operator,"Zihan Wang, Ziyang Huang, Xiaonan Zhang, Gengyin Li, Le Zheng","Recently, subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) have emerged frequently worldwide, with the high penetration of renewable power generation in modern power systems. The SSO introduced by renewables has become a prominent new stability problem, seriously threatening the stable operation of systems. This paper proposes a data-driven dynamic optimal controller for renewable energy integrated power systems, to suppress SSOs with the control of renewables. The challenges of the controller design are the nonlinearity, complexity and hard accessibility of the system models. Using Koopman operator, the system dynamics are accurately extracted from data and utilized to the linear model predictive control (MPC). Firstly, the globally linear representation of the system dynamics is obtained by lifting, and the key states are selected as control signals by analyzing Koopman participation factors. Subsequently, augmented with the control term, the Koopman linear parameter-varying predictor of the controlled system is constructed. Finally, using MPC, the proposed controller computes control signals online in a moving horizon fashion. Case studies show that the proposed controller is effective, adaptive and robust in various conditions, surpassing other controllers with reliable control performance.",2024-07-02T10:14:57Z,2024-07-02T10:14:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02124v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02124v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Firstly, to define and compare rationally the state control ability between the different controlled plants or one controlled plant with the different system parameters, the normalization of the input variables, the state variables, the system mdeols are discussed. With the help of the normalization, the state control ability with the time attribute can be difined under the unit input constraint (input amplitude limited). And then, two theorems on the relations among the open-loop control ability, the control strategy space (i.e., the solution space of the input variables for control problems), and the closed-loop performance with the time attribute are purposed and proven. Based on that, the conclusion that it is very necessary to optimize the control ability for the practical engineering problems can be got.

Symbolic control of stochastic systems via approximately bisimilar   finite abstractions,"Majid Zamani, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani, Rupak Majumdar, Alessandro Abate, John Lygeros","Symbolic approaches to the control design over complex systems employ the construction of finite-state models that are related to the original control systems, then use techniques from finite-state synthesis to compute controllers satisfying specifications given in a temporal logic, and finally translate the synthesized schemes back as controllers for the concrete complex systems. Such approaches have been successfully developed and implemented for the synthesis of controllers over non-probabilistic control systems. In this paper, we extend the technique to probabilistic control systems modeled by controlled stochastic differential equations. We show that for every stochastic control system satisfying a probabilistic variant of incremental input-to-state stability, and for every given precision $\varepsilon>0$, a finite-state transition system can be constructed, which is $\varepsilon$-approximately bisimilar (in the sense of moments) to the original stochastic control system. Moreover, we provide results relating stochastic control systems to their corresponding finite-state transition systems in terms of probabilistic bisimulation relations known in the literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the construction by synthesizing controllers for stochastic control systems over rich specifications expressed in linear temporal logic.

A Hybrid Systems-based Hierarchical Control Architecture for   Heterogeneous Field Robot Teams,"Chanyoung Ju, Hyoung Il Son","Field robot systems have recently been applied to a wide range of research fields. Making such systems more automated, advanced, and activated requires cooperation among heterogeneous robots. Classic control theory is inefficient in managing large-scale complex dynamic systems. Therefore, the supervisory control theory based on discrete event system needs to be introduced to overcome this limitation. In this study, we propose a hybrid systems-based hierarchical control architecture through a supervisory control-based high-level controller and a traditional control-based low-level controller. The hybrid systems and its dynamics are modeled through a formal method called hybrid automata, and the behavior specifications expressing the control objectives for cooperation are designed. Additionally, a modular supervisor that is more scalable and maintainable than a centralized supervisory controller was synthesized. The proposed hybrid systems and hierarchical control architecture were implemented, validated, and then evaluated for performance through the physics-based simulator. Experimental results confirmed that the heterogeneous field robot team satisfied the given specifications and presented systematic results, validating the efficiency of the proposed control architecture.",2020-02-20T07:39:59Z,2020-02-20T07:39:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08602v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08602v1,"cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Feedback Stabilization Using Koopman Operator,"Bowen Huang, Xu Ma, Umesh Vaidya","In this paper, we provide a systematic approach for the design of stabilizing feedback controllers for nonlinear control systems using the Koopman operator framework. The Koopman operator approach provides a linear representation for a nonlinear dynamical system and a bilinear representation for a nonlinear control system. The problem of feedback stabilization of a nonlinear control system is then transformed to the stabilization of a bilinear control system. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF)-based approach for the design of stabilizing feedback controllers for the bilinear system. The search for finding a CLF for the bilinear control system is formulated as a convex optimization problem. This leads to a schematic procedure for designing CLF-based stabilizing feedback controllers for the bilinear system and hence the original nonlinear system. Another advantage of the proposed controller design approach outlined in this paper is that it does not require explicit knowledge of system dynamics. In particular, the bilinear representation of a nonlinear control system in the Koopman eigenfunction space can be obtained from time-series data. Simulation results are presented to verify the main results on the design of stabilizing feedback controllers and the data-driven aspect of the proposed approach.",2018-09-28T21:40:43Z,2018-09-28T21:40:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00089v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00089v1,math.OC

Dividing the indeterminate entries into two categories, generic entries and unspecified entries, a system is PSSC, if for almost all values of the generic entries in the parameter space except for a set of measure zero, and any nonzero (complex) values of the unspecified entries, the corresponding system is controllable. We highlight that this notion generalizes the generic property embedded in the conventional structural controllability for single-input systems. We then give algebraic and (bipartite) graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient conditions for single-input systems to be PSSC. Conditions for multi-input systems are subsequently given for a special case.

Control of a pendulum system: From simulation to reality,Iyer Venkataraman Natarajan,"Control theory deals with the study of controlling dynamical systems. Robots today are growing increasingly complex and moving out of factory floors to real world environment. These robots have to interact with real world environment factors such as disturbances and this requires the robot to have a control system that is robust. Testing control algorithms on robots in real world environment can pose critical safety issues and can be financially expensive. This has resulted in a heavy emphasis on using simulation to test control algorithms before deploying them in real world environments. Designing control algorithms is an iterative process that starts with modelling the target system in simulation, designing a controller, testing the controller in simulation and then changing the controller parameters to design a better controller. This report explores how an approximated system model of a target hardware system can be developed, which can then be used to design a LQR controller for the target system. The controller is then tested under a disturbance, on hardware and in simulation, and the system response is recorded. The system response from hardware and simulation are then compared to validate the use of approximated system models in simulation for designing and testing control algorithms.",2023-12-08T10:55:51Z,2024-02-07T16:41:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04967v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04967v2,cs.RO
Data-driven Self-triggered Control via Trajectory Prediction,"Wenjie Liu, Jian Sun, Gang Wang, Francesco Bullo, Jie Chen","Self-triggered control, a well-documented technique for reducing the communication overhead while ensuring desired system performance, is gaining increasing popularity. However, existing methods for self-triggered control require explicit system models that are assumed perfectly known a priori. An end-to-end control paradigm known as data-driven control learns control laws directly from data, and offers a competing alternative to the routine system identification-then-control method. In this context, the present paper puts forth data-driven self-triggered control schemes for unknown linear systems using data collected offline. Specifically, for output feedback control systems, a data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed, which computes a sequence of control inputs while generating a predicted system trajectory. A data-driven self-triggering law is designed using the predicted trajectory, to determine the next triggering time once a new measurement becomes available. For state feedback control systems, instead of capitalizing on MPC to predict the trajectory, a data-fitting problem using the pre-collected input-state data is solved, whose solution is employed to construct the self-triggering mechanism.

Run Time Assurance for Safety-Critical Systems: An Introduction to   Safety Filtering Approaches for Complex Control Systems,"Kerianne Hobbs, Mark Mote, Matthew Abate, Samuel Coogan, Eric Feron","Run Time Assurance (RTA) Systems are online verification mechanisms that filter an unverified primary controller output to ensure system safety. The primary control may come from a human operator, an advanced control approach, or an autonomous control approach that cannot be verified to the same level as simpler control systems designs. The critical feature of RTA systems is their ability to alter unsafe control inputs explicitly to assure safety. In many cases, RTA systems can functionally be described as containing a monitor that watches the state of the system and output of a primary controller, and a backup controller that replaces or modifies control input when necessary to assure safety. An important quality of an RTA system is that the assurance mechanism is constructed in a way that is entirely agnostic to the underlying structure of the primary controller. By effectively decoupling the enforcement of safety constraints from performance-related objectives, RTA offers a number of useful advantages over traditional (offline) verification.

In our work, we begin by proposing an extension of the notion of triviality to control-affine systems with arbitrary number of states and controls. Next, our first result concerns two novel characterisations of trivial control-affine systems, one of them is based on the study of infinitesimal symmetries and is thus geometric. Second, we derive a normal form of trivial control-affine systems whose Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries possesses a transitive almost abelian Lie subalgebra. Third, we study and propose a characterisation of trivial control-affine systems on $3$-dimensional manifolds with scalar control. In particular, we give a novel proof of the previous characterisation obtained by Serres.

To allow a rich class of control systems to be abstracted, the update maps of the timed game automaton are extended.

Hence the resiliency issues for control systems need to be addressed by integrating the cyber resiliency with the physical layer resiliency. We introduce frameworks that can provide a holistic view of the control system resiliency and a quantitative design paradigm that can enable an optimal cross-layer and cross-stage design at the planning, operation, and recovery stage of control systems.

Information-theoretic approach to the study of control systems,"Hugo Touchette, Seth Lloyd","We propose an information-theoretic framework for analyzing control systems based on the close relationship of controllers to communication channels. A communication channel takes an input state and transforms it into an output state. A controller, similarly, takes the initial state of a system to be controlled and transforms it into a target state. In this sense, a controller can be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce desired outputs. In this transformation process, two different control strategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics that is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop control); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on some information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop control). Using this communication channel model of control, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be perfectly controllable and perfectly observable in terms of information and entropy. In addition, we derive a quantitative trade-off between the amount of information gathered by a closed-loop controller and its relative performance advantage over an open-loop controller in stabilizing a system. This work supplements earlier results [H. Touchette, S. Lloyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1156 (2000)] by providing new derivations of the advantage afforded by closed-loop control and by proposing an information-based optimality criterion for control systems. New applications of this approach pertaining to proportional controllers, and the control of chaotic maps are also presented.",2001-04-02T19:15:06Z,2003-05-16T00:38:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0104007v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0104007v2,"physics.data-an, physics.gen-ph, quant-ph"
Distributed Emergency Frequency Control Considering Transient Stability   Constraints in Multi-Infeed Hybrid AC-DC System,"Ye Liu, Chen Shen, Zhaojian Wang","Due to possible emergency faults and frequency regulation reserve shortage in the multi-infeed hybrid AC-DC (MIDC) system, the emergency frequency control (EFC) with LCC-HVDC systems participating is important for system frequency stability. Nevertheless, the existing decentralized EFC strategies cannot guarantee the transient stability constraints of lines and cannot meet the frequency restoration requirement. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a complementary distributed EFC strategy. By selecting the semi-distributed or fully-distributed control law according to the state of AC system control center, the proposed distributed EFC can improve the control performance with a normal control center and enhance the control reliability in case of control center failure. Then, to derive the semi-distributed and fully-distributed control laws, a general design method is proposed by formulating an optimal EFC problem. Both of these two control laws can guarantee transient stability constraints, restore system frequency and achieve the defined optimal control objective. Moreover, the optimality of the closed-loop equilibrium is proven, and a Lyapunov analysis shows the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with the discontinuous control dynamics. A case study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed distributed EFC strategy.",2022-10-14T03:52:47Z,2022-10-14T03:52:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07497v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07497v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Incoherent Control of Locally Controllable Quantum Systems,"Daoyi Dong, Chenbin Zhang, Herschel Rabitz, Alexander Pechen, Tzyh-Jong Tarn","An incoherent control scheme for state control of locally controllable quantum systems is proposed. This scheme includes three steps: (1) amplitude amplification of the initial state by a suitable unitary transformation, (2) projective measurement on the amplified state, and (3) final optimization by a unitary controlled transformation. The first step increases the amplitudes of some desired eigenstates and the corresponding probability of observing these eigenstates, the second step projects, with high probability, the amplified state into a desired eigenstate, and the last step steers this eigenstate into the target state. Within this scheme, two control algorithms are presented for two classes of quantum systems. As an example, the incoherent control scheme is applied to the control of a hydrogen atom by an external field. The results support the suggestion that projective measurements can serve as an effective control and local controllability information can be used to design control laws for quantum systems. Thus, this scheme establishes a subtle connection between control design and controllability analysis of quantum systems and provides an effective engineering approach for controlling quantum systems with partial controllability information.",2008-10-21T12:49:52Z,2008-10-21T12:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3814v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3814v1,quant-ph

"Iterative Learning Control of Fast, Nonlinear, Oscillatory Dynamics   (Preprint)","John W. Brooks, Christine M. Greve","The sudden onset of deleterious and oscillatory dynamics (often called instabilities) is a known challenge in many fluid, plasma, and aerospace systems. These dynamics are difficult to address because they are nonlinear, chaotic, and are often too fast for active control schemes. In this work, we develop an alternative active controls system using an iterative, trajectory-optimization and parameter-tuning approach based on Iterative Learning Control (ILC), Time-Lagged Phase Portraits (TLPP) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met.

Recently, model reduction by generalized differential (GD) balancing has been proposed for nonlinear systems with constant input-vector fields and linear output functions. First, we study incremental properties in the GD balancing framework. Next, based on these analyses, we provide GD LQG balancing and GD $H_\infty$-balancing as controller reduction methods for nonlinear systems by focusing on linear feedback and observer gains.

On Optimized Feedback Control and the Robustification of Opimal Controls,Martin Gugat,"We consider a system that is exactly controllable. For given initial state, terminal state and objective function, an optimal control is often well-defined. Such an optimal control has the disadvantage that although it works perfectly well for the given initial state, for a perturbed initial state it often does not make sense. In this talk we present a concept to obtain robust control schemes by the combination of the optimal control with a stabilizing feedback law. In this way, also for perturbed initial states the system is controlled in a reasonable way. In the talk we focus on the boundary control of the wave equation.

In this paper, spectral representations, eigenfunctions and approximations of graphons, and their applications to graphon-based control are studied. First, spectral properties of graphons are presented and then approximations based on Fourier approximated eigenfunctions are analyzed. Within this framework, two classes of graphons with simple spectral representations are given. Applications to graphon-based control analysis are next presented; in particular, the controllability of systems distributed over very large networks is expressed in terms of the properties of the corresponding graphon dynamical systems. Moreover, spectral analysis based upon real-world network data is presented, which demonstrates that low-dimensional spectral approximations of networks are possible.

Synthesizing Control Lyapunov-Value Functions for High-Dimensional   Systems Using System Decomposition and Admissible Control Sets,"Zheng Gong, Hyun Joe Jeong, Sylvia Herbert","Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) play a vital role in modern control applications, but finding them remains a problem. Recently, the control Lyapunov-value function (CLVF) and robust CLVF have been proposed as solutions for nonlinear time-invariant systems with bounded control and disturbance. However, the CLVF suffers from the ''curse of dimensionality,'' which hinders its application to practical high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we propose a method to decompose systems of a particular coupled nonlinear structure, in order to solve for the CLVF in each low-dimensional subsystem. We then reconstruct the full-dimensional CLVF and provide sufficient conditions for when this reconstruction is exact. Moreover, a point-wise optimal controller can be obtained using a quadratic program. We also show that when the exact reconstruction is impossible, the subsystems' CLVFs and their ``admissible control sets'' can be used to generate a Lipschitz continuous CLF.

Performance Analysis of Universal Robot Control System Using Networked   Predictive Control,"Mahsa Noroozi, Lorenz Kies","Networked control systems are feedback control systems with system components distributed at different locations connected through a communication network. Since the communication network is carried out through the internet and there are bandwidth and packet size limitations, network constraints appear. Some of these constraints are time delay and packet loss. These network limitations can degrade the performance and even destabilize the system. To overcome the adverse effect of these communication constraints, various approaches have been developed, among which a representative one is networked predictive control. This approach proposes a controller, which compensates for the network time delay and packet loss actively. This paper aims at implementing a networked predictive control system for controlling a robot arm through a computer network. The network delay is accounted for by a predictor, while the potential of packet loss is mitigated using redundant control packets. The results will show the stability of the system despite a high delay and a considerable packet loss. Additionally, improvements to previous networked predictive control systems will be suggested and an increase in performance can be shown. Lastly, the effects of different system and environment parameters on the control loop will be investigated.",2022-07-18T09:04:52Z,2022-08-16T07:55:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08450v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08450v2,cs.RO
Optimal Local and Remote Controls of Multiple Systems with   Multiplicative Noises and Unreliable Uplink Channels,"Qingyuan Qi, Lihua Xie, Huanshui Zhang","In this paper, the optimal local and remote linear quadratic (LQ) control problem is studied for a networked control system (NCS) which consists of multiple subsystems and each of which is described by a general multiplicative noise stochastic system with one local controller and one remote controller. Due to the unreliable uplink channels, the remote controller can only access unreliable state information of all subsystems, while the downlink channels from the remote controller to the local controllers are perfect. The difficulties of the LQ control problem for such a system arise from the different information structures of the local controllers and the remote controller. By developing the Pontyagin maximum principle, the necessary and sufficient solvability conditions are derived, which are based on the solution to a group of forward and backward difference equations (G-FBSDEs). Furthermore, by proposing a new method to decouple the G-FBSDEs and introducing new coupled Riccati equations (CREs), the optimal control strategies are derived where we verify that the separation principle holds for the multiplicative noise NCSs with packet dropouts. This paper can be seen as an important contribution to the optimal control problem with asymmetric information structures.",2020-07-30T00:28:57Z,2020-07-30T00:28:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15158v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15158v1,math.OC

Rather than treating the interconnected system as a whole, we first design local safety controllers for each subsystem separately to enforce local safety properties, with polytopic state and input constraints as well as bounded disturbance set. Then, by composing the local controllers, the interconnected system is guaranteed to satisfy the overall safety specification.

Differentiable Optimization-based Control Policy with Convergence   Analysis,"Yuexin Bian, Jie Feng, Yuanyuan Shi","Real-world system control requires both high-performing and interpretable controllers. Model-based control policies have gained popularity by using historical data to learn system costs and dynamics before implementation. However, this two-phase approach prevents these policies from achieving optimal control as the metrics that we train these models (e.g., mean squared errors) often differ from the actual control system cost. In this paper, we present DiffOP, a Differentiable Optimization-based Policy for optimal control. In the proposed framework, control actions are derived by solving an optimization, where the control cost function and system's dynamics can be parameterized as neural networks. Our key technical innovation lies in developing a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines policy gradients with implicit differentiation through the optimization layer, enabling end-to-end training with the actual cost feedback. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove DiffOP converges to stationary points at a rate of $O(1/K)$.

The optimization design is motivated by the implementation issues where it is desirable to reduce the time in trial and error process and accurately find the best decentralized subcontrollers. The method is applied to decentralized control system design for a short takeoff and landing fighter.

By integrating these separately designed controllers, the overall system's safety is ensured. Moreover, a new filter-based disturbance observer is utilized to design a PCBF-based safe controller for strict-feedback systems subject to mismatched disturbances. This approach broadens the class of systems to which CBF-based methods can be applied and significantly simplifies CBF construction by requiring only the model of the proxy subsystem.

However more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable, and harsh environments. Intelligent flight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning (RL) which has had success in other applications such as robotics. However previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent flight control systems trained with the state-of-the-art RL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy (DDGP), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

Intrusion Detection and Localization for Networked Embedded Control   Systems,"Vuk Lesi, Marcio Juliato, Shabbir Ahmed, Christopher Gutierrez, Qian Wang, Manoj Sastry","Closed-loop control systems employ continuous sensing and actuation to maintain controlled variables within preset bounds and achieve the desired system output. Intentional disturbances in the system, such as in the case of cyberattacks, can compromise reachability of control goals, and in several cases jeopardize safety. The increasing connectivity and exposure of networked control to external networks has enabled attackers to compromise these systems by exploiting security vulnerabilities. Attacks against safety-critical control loops can not only drive the system over a trajectory different from the desired, but also cause fatal consequences to humans. In this paper we present a physics-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aimed at increasing the security in control systems. In addition to conventional process state estimation for intrusion detection, since the controller cannot be trusted, we introduce a controller state estimator. Additionally, we make our detector context-aware by utilizing sensor measurements from other control loops, which allows to distinguish and characterize disturbances from attacks. We introduce adaptive thresholding and adaptive filtering as means to achieve context-awareness. Together, these methodologies allow detection and localization of attacks in closed-loop controls. Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of the approach by mounting a series of attacks against a networked Direct Current (DC) motor closed-loop speed control deployed on an ECU testbed, as well as on a simulated automated lane keeping system. Among other application domains, this set of approaches is key to support security in automotive systems, and ultimately increase road and passenger safety.",2021-06-17T21:49:07Z,2021-06-17T21:49:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09826v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09826v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Synthesis to Deployment: Cyber-Physical Control Architectures,"Shih-Hao Tseng, James Anderson","We consider the problem of how to deploy a controller to a (networked) cyber-physical system (CPS). Controlling a CPS is an involved task, and synthesizing a controller to respect sensing, actuation, and communication constraints is only part of the challenge. In addition to controller synthesis, one should also consider how the controller will be incorporated within the CPS. Put another way, the cyber layer and its interaction with the physical layer need to be taken into account.   In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical controller synthesis and practical CPS deployment. We adopt the system level synthesis (SLS) framework to synthesize a controller, either state-feedback or output-feedback, and provide deployment architectures for the standard SLS controllers. Furthermore, we derive new controller realizations for open-loop stable systems and introduce different state-feedback and output-feedback architectures for deployment, ranging from fully centralized to fully distributed. Finally, we compare the trade-offs among them in terms of robustness, memory, computation, and communication overhead.",2020-12-09T18:09:52Z,2021-06-01T03:47:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05211v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05211v2,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"
MPC-based Realtime Power System Control with DNN-based   Prediction/Sensitivity-Estimation,"Ramij Raja Hossain, Ratnesh Kumar","This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC)-based online real-time adaptive control scheme for emergency voltage control in power systems. Despite tremendous success in various applications, real-time implementation of MPC for control in power systems has not been successful due to its online computational burden for large-sized systems that takes more time than available between the two control decisions. This long-standing problem is addressed here by developing a novel MPC-based adaptive control framework which (i) adapts the nominal offline computed control, by successive control corrections, at each control decision point using the latest measurements, (ii) utilizes data-driven approach for prediction of voltage trajectory and its sensitivity with respect to control using trained deep neural networks (DNNs). In addition, a realistic coordination scheme among control inputs of static var compensators (SVC), load-shedding (LS), and load tap-changers (LTC) is presented with a goal of maintaining bus voltages within a predefined permissible range, where the delayed effect of LTC action is also incorporated in a novel way. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated for IEEE 9-bus as well as 39-bus systems, with $\pm 20\%$ variations in nominal loading conditions.

DPC poses an approximate solution to multiparametric programming problems emerging from explicit nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). Contrary to approximate MPC, DPC does not require supervision by an expert controller. Instead, a system dynamics model is learned from the observed system's dynamics, and the neural control law is optimized offline by leveraging the differentiable closed-loop system model. The combination of a differentiable closed-loop system and penalty methods for constraint handling of system outputs and inputs allows us to optimize the control law's parameters directly by backpropagating economic MPC loss through the learned system model.

The primary objective of controlling grid-connected MMCs (GC-MMCs) is to accurately track real and reactive power references while maintaining excellent harmonic performance in the output response. This paper proposes a novel model-free control strategy for GC-MMCs, employing a Fractional Order Proportional-Integral (FOPI) controller and a Fractional Order Fuzzy type-II Proportional-Integral (FOFPI) controller. The FOFPI controller utilizes a type-II Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to adaptively adjust the proportional and derivative gains during the control process, enabling effective control of the MMC under diverse operating conditions. The type-II FIS, which leverages type-II fuzzy sets, can mitigate uncertainty and nonlinearity in the system.

Decentralized Control of Stochastically Switched Linear System with   Unreliable Communication,"Seyed Mohammad Asghari, Yi Ouyang, Ashutosh Nayyar","We consider a networked control system (NCS) consisting of two plants, a global plant and a local plant, and two controllers, a global controller and a local controller.

We assume that the state and mode of the global plant are observed by both controllers while the state and mode of the local plant are only observed by the local controller. The local controller can inform the global controller of the local plant's state and mode through an unreliable TCP-like communication channel where successful transmissions are acknowledged. The objective of the controllers is to cooperatively minimize a modes-dependent quadratic cost over a finite time horizon.

Modern communication technologies allow users to obtain resolution-varying quantized measurements based on the prices paid. In this paper, we consider optimal controller synthesis of a Quantized-Feedback Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (QF-LQG) system where the measurements are to be quantized before being transmitted to the controller. The system is presented with several choices of quantizers, along with the cost of operating each quantizer. The objective is to jointly select the quantizers and the controller that would maintain an optimal balance between control performance and quantization cost. Under certain assumptions, this problem can be decoupled into two optimization problems: one for optimal controller synthesis and the other for optimal quantizer selection. We show that, similarly to the classical LQG problem, the optimal controller synthesis subproblem is characterized by Riccati equations. On the other hand, the optimal quantizer selection policy is found by solving a certain Markov-Decision-Process (MDP).",2020-01-31T17:40:27Z,2020-01-31T17:40:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11971v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11971v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.DS"
Leveraging Predictions in Power System Frequency Control: an Adaptive   Approach,"Wenqi Cui, Guanya Shi, Yuanyuan Shi, Baosen Zhang","Ensuring the frequency stability of electric grids with increasing renewable resources is a key problem in power system operations. In recent years, a number of advanced controllers have been designed to optimize frequency control. These controllers, however, almost always assume that the net load in the system remains constant over a sufficiently long time. Given the intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable resources, it is becoming important to explicitly consider net load that is time-varying.   This paper proposes an adaptive approach to frequency control in power systems with significant time-varying net load. We leverage the advances in short-term load forecasting, where the net load in the system can be accurately predicted using weather and other features. We integrate these predictions into the design of adaptive controllers, which can be seamlessly combined with most existing controllers including conventional droop control and emerging neural network-based controllers. We prove that the overall control architecture achieves frequency restoration decentralizedly.

Resource Optimization for Tail-Based Control in Wireless Networked   Control Systems,"Rasika Vijithasena, Rafaela Scaciota, Mehdi Bennis, Sumudu Samarakoon","Achieving control stability is one of the key design challenges of scalable Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCS) under limited communication and computing resources. This paper explores the use of an alternative control concept defined as tail-based control, which extends the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) cost function for multiple dynamic control systems over a shared wireless network. We cast the control of multiple control systems as a network-wide optimization problem and decouple it in terms of sensor scheduling, plant state prediction, and control policies. Toward this, we propose a solution consisting of a scheduling algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization for sensing, a mechanism based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for state prediction and uncertainty estimation, and a control policy based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure tail-based control stability. A set of discrete time-invariant mountain car control systems is used to evaluate the proposed solution and is compared against four variants that use state-of-the-art scheduling, prediction, and control methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method yields 22% reduction in overall cost in terms of communication and control resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods.",2024-06-20T13:27:44Z,2024-06-20T13:27:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14301v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14301v1,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY"

Optimal control of linear systems with limited control actions:   threshold-based event-triggered control,"Burak Demirel, Euhanna Ghadimi, Daniel E. Quevedo, Mikael Johansson","We consider a finite-horizon linear-quadratic optimal control problem where only a limited number of control messages are allowed for sending from the controller to the actuator. To restrict the number of control actions computed and transmitted by the controller, we employ a threshold-based event-triggering mechanism that decides whether or not a control message needs to be calculated and delivered. Due to the nature of threshold-based event-triggering algorithms, finding the optimal control sequence requires minimizing a quadratic cost function over a non-convex domain. In this paper, we firstly provide an exact solution to the non-convex problem mentioned above by solving an exponential number of quadratic programs. To reduce computational complexity, we, then, propose two efficient heuristic algorithms based on greedy search and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method. Later, we consider a receding horizon control strategy for linear systems controlled by event-triggered controllers, and we also provide a complete stability analysis of receding horizon control that uses finite horizon optimization in the proposed class.

Supervisor Localization of Discrete-Event Systems with Infinite Behavior,"Renyuan Zhang, Kai Cai","Recently we developed supervisor localization, a top-down approach to distributed control of discrete-event systems (DES) with finite behavior. Its essence is the allocation of monolithic (global) control action among the local control strategies of individual agents. In this report, we extend supervisor localization to study the distributed control of DES with infinite behavior. Specifically, we first employ Thistle and Wonham's supervisory control theory for DES with infinite behavior to compute a safety supervisor (for safety specifications) and a liveness supervisor (for liveness specifications), and then design a suitable localization procedure to decompose the safety supervisor into a set of safety local controllers, one for each controllable event, and decompose the liveness supervisor into a set of liveness local controllers, two for each controllable event. The localization procedure for decomposing the liveness supervisor is novel; in particular, a local controller is responsible for disabling the corresponding controllable event on only part of the states of the liveness supervisor, and consequently, the derived local controller in general has states number no more than that computed by considering the disablement on all the states. Moreover, we prove that the derived local controllers achieve the same controlled behavior with the safety and liveness supervisors. We finally illustrate the result by a Small Factory example.",2017-10-24T13:16:54Z,2017-10-24T13:16:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08751v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08751v1,cs.SY
Load Frequency Control of Solar PV and Solar Thermal Integrated Micro   grid using Narma-L2 Controller,Sambit Dash,"In this paper a novel approach to load frequency control of a microgrid with integrated Solar PV and Solar thermal generator is presented. A nonlinear adaptive controller based on an autoregressive moving average algorithm (NARMA) is used to control the frequency of the system. The objective of such a controller is to regulate and minimize frequency deviation due load changes. Further, a novel metaheuristic approach called Modified Whale Optimization Algorithm (MWOA) is used for creating an optimal PID controller to be used for frequency control. Finally, a comparative study between the proposed NARMA-L2 controller, WOA tuned PID controller and conventional PID controller is presented.

Decoherence and the conditions for the classical control of quantum   systems,G J Milburn,We find the conditions for one quantum system to function as a classical controller of another quantum system: the controller must be an open system and rapidly diagonalised in the basis of the controller variable that is coupled to the controlled system. This causes decoherence in the controlled system that can be made small if the rate of diagonalisation is fast. We give a detailed example based on the quantum optomechanical control of a mechanical resonator. The resulting equations are similar in structure to recently proposed models for consistently combining quantum and classical stochastic dynamics.,2012-01-24T20:43:00Z,2012-01-24T20:43:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5111v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5111v1,quant-ph

The developed methodology is based on the Arstein's theory of control Liapunov functions and related Sontag's formula, extended to retarded systems. If the actuator disturbance is bounded, then the controller yields the solution of the closed-loop system to achieve an arbitrarily fixed neighborhood of the origin, by increasing a control tuning parameter.

To find a CLF, many methods have been proposed in the literature, e.g. backstepping for cascaded systems and sum of squares (SOS) programming for polynomial systems. Dealing with continuous-time systems, the CLF-based controller is also continuous-time, whereas practical implementation on a digital platform requires sampled-time control.

Safety-Critical Control Synthesis for Unknown Sampled-Data Systems via   Control Barrier Functions,"Luyao Niu, Hongchao Zhang, Andrew Clark","As the complexity of control systems increases, safety becomes an increasingly important property since safety violations can damage the plant and put the system operator in danger. When the system dynamics are unknown, safety-critical synthesis becomes more challenging. Additionally, modern systems are controlled digitally and hence behave as sampled-data systems, i.e., the system dynamics evolve continuously while the control input is applied at discrete time steps. In this paper, we study the problem of control synthesis for safety-critical sampled-data systems with unknown dynamics. We overcome the challenges introduced by sampled-data implementation and unknown dynamics by constructing a set of control barrier function (CBF)-based constraints. By satisfying the constructed CBF constraint at each sampling time, we guarantee the unknown sampled-data system is safe for all time. We formulate a non-convex program to solve for the control signal at each sampling time. We decompose the non-convex program into two convex sub-problems.

A Unified Robust Motion Controller Synthesis for Compliant Robots Driven   by Series Elastic Actuators,Emre Sariyildiz,"This paper proposes a unified robust motion controller for the position and force control problems of compliant robot manipulators driven by Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs). It is shown that the dynamic model of the compliant robot includes not only matched but also mismatched disturbances that act on the system through a different channel from the control input. To tackle this complex robust control problem, the unified robust motion controller is synthesised by employing a second-order Disturbance Observer (DOb), which allows us to estimate not only disturbances but also their first and second order derivatives, and a novel controller design approach in state space. By using the Brunovsky canonical form transformation and the estimations of disturbances and their first and second order derivatives, the dynamic model of the robot is reconstructed so that a new system model that includes only matched disturbances is obtained for compliant robots driven by SEAs. The robust position and force controllers are simply designed by eliminating the matched disturbances of the reconstructed system model via the conventional DOb-based robust control method. The stability and performance of the proposed robust motion controllers are verified by simulations.",2022-02-01T00:51:54Z,2022-02-01T00:51:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00168v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00168v1,"cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Output-feedback control is facilitated by using the block-observable canonical form for linear, time-varying dynamics.

Furthermore, using differential flatness, we provide a constructive means to synthesize the multi-rate controller, thereby removing the need to search for suitable Lyapunov or barrier functions, or to approximately linearize/discretize nonlinear dynamics. We show the synthesized controller is a convex optimization problem, making it amenable to real-time implementations. The method is demonstrated experimentally on a ground rover and a quadruped robotic system.",2024-03-26T18:04:10Z,2024-03-26T18:04:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18015v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18015v1,"eess.SY, cs.RO, cs.SY"
Controllability of Linear Dynamical Systems Under Input Sparsity   Constraints,"Geethu Joseph, Chandra R. Murthy","In this work, we consider the controllability of a discrete-time linear dynamical system with sparse control inputs. Sparsity constraints on the input arises naturally in networked systems, where activating each input variable adds to the cost of control. We derive algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring controllability of a system with an arbitrary transfer matrix. The derived conditions can be verified in polynomial time complexity, unlike the more traditional Kalman-type rank tests. Further, we characterize the minimum number of input vectors required to satisfy the derived conditions for controllability. Finally, we present a generalized Kalman decomposition-like procedure that separates the state-space into subspaces corresponding to sparse-controllable and sparse-uncontrollable parts. These results form a theoretical basis for designing networked linear control systems with sparse inputs.",2019-12-27T16:36:27Z,2019-12-27T16:36:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12224v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12224v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.OC"
Optimal Transport-based Coverage Control for Swarm Robot Systems:   Generalization of the Voronoi Tessellation-based Method,"Daisuke Inoue, Yuji Ito, Hiroaki Yoshida","Swarm robot systems, which consist of many cooperating mobile robots, have attracted attention for their environmental adaptability and fault tolerance advantages. One of the most important tasks for such systems is coverage control, in which robots autonomously deploy to approximate a given spatial distribution. In this study, we formulate a coverage control paradigm using the concept of optimal transport and propose a novel control technique, which we have termed the optimal transport-based coverage control (OTCC) method. The proposed OTCC, derived via the gradient flow of the cost function in the Kantorovich dual problem, is shown to covers a widely used existing control method as a special case. We also perform a Lyapunov stability analysis of the controlled system, and provide numerical calculations to show that the OTCC reproduces target distributions with better performance than the existing control method.",2020-11-16T23:44:34Z,2020-11-16T23:44:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08337v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08337v1,"math.OC, cs.RO, cs.SY, eess.SY"

We present a novel two-level online algorithm, by integrating a higher-level learning strategy and a lower-level feedback control strategy. This method offers a practical and robust solution for online control, which achieves sublinear regret. Our work provides the first nonasymptotic results for controlling continuous-time linear systems with finite number of interactions with the system. Moreover, we examine how to train an agent in domain randomization environments from a non-stochastic control perspective. By applying our method to the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, we achieved improved results in multiple reinforcement learning tasks within domain randomization environments.

Reducing Conservativeness of Controlled-Invariant Safe Sets by   Introducing a Novel Synthesis of Control Barrier Certificates,"Naeim Ebrahimi Toulkani, Reza Ghabcheloo","Finding a controlled-invariant safe set for a given system with state and control constraints plays an important role in safety-critical systems. Current methods typically produce conservative solutions. In this paper, we introduce a method to generate controlled-invariant safe sets for nonlinear polynomial control-affine dynamical systems by using the notion of Control Barrier Certificates (CBCs). To this end, we relax CBC conditions into Sum of Squares (SOS) constraints, to be solved by an SOS program. We first assume a controlled-invariant safe set (although small) exists for the system. We then propose a method to iteratively enlarge the safe set. We theoretically prove that our method enlarges the safe set in each iteration. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our method through simulated numerical examples in 2D and 3D for single and multi-input dynamical systems and empirically show that our method produces a larger controlled-invariant safe set in these examples, compared to a state-of-the-art technique using Control Barrier Function (CBF).",2024-11-12T08:44:01Z,2024-11-12T08:44:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07640v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07640v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Safety of Sampled-Data Systems with Control Barrier Functions via   Approximate Discrete Time Models,"Andrew J. Taylor, Victor D. Dorobantu, Ryan K. Cosner, Yisong Yue, Aaron D.

Existing design paradigms do not address the gap between theory (controller design with continuous time models) and practice (the discrete time sampled implementation of the resulting controllers); this can lead to poor performance and violations of safety for hardware instantiations. We propose an approach to close this gap by synthesizing sampled-data counterparts to these CBF-based controllers using approximate discrete time models and Sampled-Data Control Barrier Functions (SD-CBFs). Using properties of a system's continuous time model, we establish a relationship between SD-CBFs and a notion of practical safety for sampled-data systems. Furthermore, we construct convex optimization-based controllers that formally endow nonlinear systems with safety guarantees in practice.

Firstly, different from all existing control methods for systems with state quantization, global stability of strict-feedback nonlinear systems is achieved without requiring the condition that the nonlinearities of the system model satisfy global Lipschitz continuity. Secondly, a novel barrier function-free prescribed performance control (BFPPC) method is proposed, which can guarantee prescribed transient performance under quantized states. Thirdly, a new \textit{W}-function-based control scheme is designed such that virtual control signals are not required to be differentiated repeatedly and the controller could be designed in a simple way, which guarantees global stability and lower design complexity compared with traditional dynamic surface control (DSC).

A small gain approach is used to evaluate the performance of the given quantum system. In order to get improved control performance, we propose two methods to design a coherent controller for the system. One is to formulate a static quantum controller by adding a controller Hamiltonian to the given system, and the other is to build a dynamic quantum controller which is directly coupled to the given system. Both controller design methods are given in terms of LMIs and a non-convex equality. Hence, a rank constrained LMI method is used as a numerical procedure. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the proposed methods and also to make a performance comparison with different controller design methods. Results show that for the same uncertain quantum system, the dynamic quantum controller can offer an improvement in performance over the static quantum controller.",2015-08-11T04:41:11Z,2015-08-11T04:41:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02485v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02485v1,cs.SY
Verified Compositions of Neural Network Controllers for Temporal Logic   Control Objectives,"Jun Wang, Samarth Kalluraya, Yiannis Kantaros","This paper presents a new approach to design verified compositions of Neural Network (NN) controllers for autonomous systems with tasks captured by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. Particularly, the LTL formula requires the system to reach and avoid certain regions in a temporal/logical order. We assume that the system is equipped with a finite set of trained NN controllers. Each controller has been trained so that it can drive the system towards a specific region of interest while avoiding others. Our goal is to check if there exists a temporal composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so, to compute it - that will yield composite system behaviors that satisfy a user-specified LTL task for any initial system state belonging to a given set. To address this problem, we propose a new approach that relies on a novel integration of automata theory and recently proposed reachability analysis tools for NN-controlled systems. We note that the proposed method can be applied to other controllers, not necessarily modeled by NNs, by appropriate selection of the reachability analysis tool. We focus on NN controllers due to their lack of robustness.

An Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Strategy in Closed-loop Control of Anesthesia,"Mohammad Javad Khodaei, Mohammad Hadi Balaghi Inaloo, Amin Mehrvarz, Nader Jalili","This paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy framework to improve drug infusion rate in closed-loop control of anesthesia. The proposed controller provides a sub-optimal propofol administration rate as input to reach the desired bispectral index, which is the output of the system, in both induction and maintenance phases. In this controller, a critic agent assesses the plant output and produces a reinforcement signal to adapt the controller parameters and minimize the propofol administration rate. The controller is applied to a conventional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics model of anesthesia to evaluate its applicability in closed loop-control of anesthesia. To simulate the designed controller, physiological parameters of 12 patients are used in the mathematical model. The simulation results show that the proposed controller can overcome current challenges in the closed-loop control of anesthesia like inter patient variability, model uncertainties and surgical disturbances without overdose or underdose in a time range of 2 to 4 minutes.

Reinforcement Learning for Process Control with Application in   Semiconductor Manufacturing,"Yanrong Li, Juan Du, Wei Jiang","Process control is widely discussed in the manufacturing process, especially for semiconductor manufacturing. Due to unavoidable disturbances in manufacturing, different process controllers are proposed to realize variation reduction. Since reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great advantages in learning actions from interactions with a dynamic system, we introduce RL methods for process control and propose a new controller called RL-based controller. Considering the fact that most existing process controllers mainly rely on a linear model assumption for the process input-output relationship, we first propose theoretical properties of RL-based controllers according to the linear model assumption. Then the performance of RL-based controllers and traditional process controllers (e.g., exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), general harmonic rule (GHR) controllers) are compared for linear processes. Furthermore, we find that the RL-based controllers have potential advantages to deal with other complicated nonlinear processes that are with and without assumed explicit model formulations. The intensive numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed RL-based controllers.",2021-10-22T03:31:00Z,2021-10-22T03:31:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11572v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11572v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Optimal Sampled-Data Control of a Nonlinear System,"Yasuaki Oishi, Noboru Sakamoto","Optimal sampled-data control of a nonlinear system is considered with the stable-manifold approach and extensive use of numerical techniques. The idea is to notice the Hamiltonian system associated with the considered optimal control problem and to compute trajectories on its stable manifold. Since the control input accompanied with those trajectories is proved to be optimal, the optimal control law can be obtained through interpolation. The stable-manifold approach was originally proposed for continuous-time optimal control and here it is adapted for sampled-data control based on the works of Navasca. In the case of sampled-data control, the approach requires the state transition of the controlled plant during one sampling period together with its derivatives with respect to the state and the input. Their computation is achieved by numerical techniques. Moreover, a shooting method is proposed for systematic generation of the trajectories and extension is considered for the intersample behavior to be taken into account. The proposed method is applied to tracking control of a wheeled mobile robot. It works successfully with a rather long sampling period.",2021-12-29T11:26:20Z,2021-12-29T11:26:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14507v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14507v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.OC"
Unifying Controller Design for Stabilizing Nonlinear Systems with   Norm-Bounded Control Inputs,"Ming Li, Zhiyong Sun, Siep Weiland","This paper revisits a classical challenge in the design of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems with a norm-bounded input constraint. By extending Lin-Sontag's universal formula and introducing a generic (state-dependent) scaling term, a unifying controller design method is proposed. The incorporation of this generic scaling term gives a unified controller and enables the derivation of alternative universal formulas with various favorable properties, which makes it suitable for tailored control designs to meet specific requirements and provides versatility across different control scenarios. Additionally, we present a constructive approach to determine the optimal scaling term, leading to an explicit solution to an optimization problem, named optimization-based universal formula. The resulting controller ensures asymptotic stability, satisfies a norm-bounded input constraint, and optimizes a predefined cost function. Finally, the essential properties of the unified controllers are analyzed, including smoothness, continuity at the origin, stability margin, and inverse optimality. Simulations validate the approach, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing a challenging stabilizing control problem of a nonlinear system.",2024-03-05T15:06:16Z,2024-03-05T15:06:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03030v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03030v1,"eess.SY, cs.AI, cs.SY, math.OC"

Megretski proved that the optimal mixed $\mathit{H}_2/\mathit{H}_\infty$ controller is non-rational whenever the constraint is active without giving an explicit construction of the controller. In this work, we provide the first exact closed-form solution to the infinite-horizon mixed $\mathit{H}_2/\mathit{H}_\infty$ control in the frequency domain. While the optimal controller is non-rational, our formulation provides a finite-dimensional parameterization of the optimal controller. Leveraging this fact, we introduce an efficient iterative algorithm that finds the optimal causal controller in the frequency domain. We show that this algorithm is convergent when the system is scalar and present numerical evidence for exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm.

Finding the Nearest Negative Imaginary System with Application to   Near-Optimal Controller Design,Mohamed Mabrok,"The negative imaginary (NI) systems theory has attracted interests due to the robustness properties of feedback interconnected NI systems. However, a full output optimal controller-synthesis methodology, for such class of systems, is yet to exist. In order to develop a solution towards this problem, we first develop a methodology to find the nearest NI system to a non NI system. This later problem stated as follows: for any linear time invariant (LTI) system defined by the state space matrices $(A, B, C, D)$, find the nearest NI system, with the state space matrices $(A+\Delta_A,B+\Delta_B,C+\Delta_C,D+\Delta_D)$, such that the norm of $(\Delta_A,\Delta_B,\Delta_C,\Delta_D)$ is minimized. Then, this methodology will be used to find the nearest optimal controller for a given NI plant. In other words, for a given NI system, an optimal control methodology, such as LQG, is used to design an optimal controller that satisfy a particular performance measure. Then, the developed methodology of finding the nearest NI system is used, as a near-optimal control synthesis methodology, to find the nearest NI system to the designed optimal controller.

Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No   Dynamic Regret,"Hongyu Zhou, Vasileios Tzoumas","We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system.

The proposed nonlinear controller is highly generalized and offers flexibility in achieving the control objective due to the freedom of choosing controller parameters from a range of values. By the virtue of additional tuning parameters, i.e. fractional powers on proportional and derivative difference terms, the nonlinear controller procures a family of UAV trajectories satisfying the same control objective. An appropriate adjustment of the parameters facilitates in generating smooth UAV trajectories without causing abrupt position jumps. The convergence of the closed-loop system is analyzed and established using the Lyapunov approach. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller which outperforms an existing formation controller by driving a team of UAVs elegantly in a target-centric formation.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive MPC variant that automatically estimates control and model parameters by leveraging ideas from Bayesian optimisation (BO) and the classical expected improvement acquisition function. We leverage recent results showing that BO can be reformulated via density ratio estimation, which can be efficiently approximated by simply learning a classifier.

Controlled fluid transport by the collective motion of microrotors,"Jake Buzhardt, Phanindra Tallapragada","Torque-driven microscale swimming robots, or microrotors, hold significant potential in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery, and micromanipulation. This paper addresses the challenge of controlling the transport of fluid volumes using the flow fields generated by interacting groups of microrotors. Our approach uses polynomial chaos expansions to model the time evolution of fluid particle distributions and formulate an optimal control problem, which we solve numerically. We implement this framework in simulation to achieve the controlled transport of an initial fluid particle distribution to a target destination while minimizing undesirable effects such as stretching and mixing. We consider the case where translational velocities of the rotors are directly controlled, as well as the case where only torques are controlled and the rotors move in response to the collective flow fields they generate. We analyze the solution of this optimal control problem by computing the Lagrangian coherent structures of the associated flow field, which reveal the formation of transport barriers that efficiently guide particles toward their target.

Online Stochastic Optimization for Unknown Linear Systems: Data-Driven   Synthesis and Controller Analysis,"Gianluca Bianchin, Miguel Vaquero, Jorge Cortes, Emiliano Dall'Anese","This paper proposes a data-driven control framework to regulate an unknown, stochastic linear dynamical system to the solution of a (stochastic) convex optimization problem. Despite the centrality of this problem, most of the available methods critically rely on a precise knowledge of the system dynamics (thus requiring off-line system identification and model refinement). To this aim, in this paper we first show that the steady-state transfer function of a linear system can be computed directly from control experiments, bypassing explicit model identification. Then, we leverage the estimated transfer function to design a controller -- which is inspired by stochastic gradient descent methods -- that regulates the system to the solution of the prescribed optimization problem. A distinguishing feature of our methods is that they do not require any knowledge of the system dynamics, disturbance terms, or their distributions. Our technical analysis combines concepts and tools from behavioral system theory, stochastic optimization with decision-dependent distributions, and stability analysis. We illustrate the applicability of the framework on a case study for mobility-on-demand ride service scheduling in Manhattan, NY.",2021-08-30T08:03:16Z,2021-08-30T08:03:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13040v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Optimal PID and Antiwindup Control Design as a Reinforcement Learning   Problem,"Nathan P. Lawrence, Gregory E. Stewart, Philip D. Loewen, Michael G. Forbes, Johan U. Backstrom, R. Bhushan Gopaluni","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has seen several successful applications to process control. Common methods rely on a deep neural network structure to model the controller or process. With increasingly complicated control structures, the closed-loop stability of such methods becomes less clear. In this work, we focus on the interpretability of DRL control methods. In particular, we view linear fixed-structure controllers as shallow neural networks embedded in the actor-critic framework. PID controllers guide our development due to their simplicity and acceptance in industrial practice. We then consider input saturation, leading to a simple nonlinear control structure. In order to effectively operate within the actuator limits we then incorporate a tuning parameter for anti-windup compensation. Finally, the simplicity of the controller allows for straightforward initialization. This makes our method inherently stabilizing, both during and after training, and amenable to known operational PID gains.",2020-05-10T01:05:26Z,2020-05-10T01:05:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04539v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04539v1,"math.OC, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Teaching data-driven control: from linear design to adaptive control   with throttle valves,"Emmanuel Witrant, Ioan DorÉ Landau, Marie-Pierre Vaillant","Electric throttle valves represent a challenge for control design, as their dynamics involve strong nonlinearities, characterized by an asymmetric hysteresis. Carrying experiments on multiple valves, a large variability in the characteristics of each valve and erratic steady-state behaviors can also be noticed, impairing classical model-based control strategies. Nevertheless, local data-driven linear models can be obtained and simple proportional-integral (PI) controllers, tuned individually for each valve with the appropriate data set, provide good tracking performance. As these controllers cannot be transposed from one valve to another, a robust strategy and an adaptive controller (using identification in closed-loop and controller re-design) may be necessary to propose a general method. This work aims at promoting control education on a simple yet challenging process, going from frequency analysis and linear design to an adaptive control method implemented with an online recursive algorithm.",2023-03-30T11:37:42Z,2023-03-30T11:37:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01567v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.01567v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, 93-05"
Hierarchical Control for the Wave Equation with a Moving Boundary,Isaías Pereira de Jesus,"This paper addresses the study of the hierarchical control for the one-dimensional wave equation in intervals with a moving boundary. This equation models the motion of a string where an endpoint is fixed and the other one is moving. When the speed of the moving endpoint is less than the characteristic speed, the controllability of this equation is established. We assume that we can act on the dynamic of the system by a hierarchy of controls. According to the formulation given by H. von Stackelberg (Marktform und Gleichgewicht, Springer, Berlin, 1934), there are local controls called followers and global controls called leaders. In fact, one considers situations where there are two cost (objective) functions. One possible way is to cut the control into two parts, one being thought of as ``the leader"" and the other one as ``the follower"". This situation is studied in the paper, with one of the cost functions being of the controllability type. We present the following results: the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium, the approximate controllability with respect to the leader control, and the optimality system for the leader control.",2025-01-26T16:54:12Z,2025-01-26T16:54:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10415v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10415v1,"math.OC, 35Q10, 35B37, 35B40"
Impedance Modulation for Negotiating Control Authority in a Haptic   Shared Control Paradigm,"Vahid Izadi, Akshay Bhardwaj, Amir H. Ghasemi","Communication and cooperation among team members can be enhanced significantly with physical interaction. Successful collaboration requires the integration of the individual partners' intentions into a shared action plan, which may involve a continuous negotiation of intentions and roles. This paper presents an adaptive haptic shared control framework wherein a human driver and an automation system are physically connected through a motorized steering wheel. By virtue of haptic feedback, the driver and automation system can monitor each other actions and can still intuitively express their control intentions. The objective of this paper is to develop a systematic model for an automation system that can vary its impedance such that the control authority can transit between the two agents intuitively and smoothly. To this end, we defined a cost function that not only ensures the safety of the collaborative task but also takes account of the assistive behavior of the automation system. We employed a predictive controller based on modified least square to modulate the automation system impedance such that the cost function is optimized. The results demonstrate the significance of the proposed approach for negotiating the control authority, specifically when humans and automation are in a non-cooperative mode. Furthermore, the performance of the adaptive haptic shared control is compared with the traditional fixed automation impedance haptic shared control paradigm.",2020-01-21T21:28:19Z,2020-03-20T00:33:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07779v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07779v2,"eess.SY, cs.RO, cs.SY"
Nested Control Co-design of a Spar Buoy Horizontal-axis Floating   Offshore Wind Turbine,"Saeid Bayat, Yong Hoon Lee, James T. Allison","Floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) systems involve several coupled physical analysis disciplines, including aeroelasticity, multi-body structural dynamics, hydrodynamics, and controls. Conventionally, physical structure (plant) and control design decisions are treated as two separate problems, and generally, control design is performed after the plant design is complete. However, this sequential design approach cannot fully capitalize upon the synergy between plant and control design decisions. These conventional design practices produce suboptimal designs, especially in cases with strong coupling between plant and control design decisions. Control co-design (CCD) is a holistic design approach that accounts fully for plant-control design coupling by optimizing these decisions simultaneously. CCD is especially advantageous for system design problems with complex interactions between physics disciplines, which is the case for FOWT systems. This paper presents and demonstrates a nested CCD approach using open-loop optimal control (OLOC) for a simplified reduced-order model that simulates FOWT dynamic behavior. This simplified model is helpful for optimization studies due to its computational efficiency, but is still sufficiently rich enough to capture important multidisciplinary physics couplings and plant-control design coupling associated with a horizontal-axis FOWT system with a spar buoy floating platform. The CCD result shows an improvement in the objective function, annual energy production (AEP), compared to the baseline design by more than eleven percent. Optimization studies at this fidelity level can provide system design engineers with insights into design directions that leverage design coupling to improve performance. These studies also provide a template for future more detailed turbine CCD optimization studies that utilize higher fidelity models and design representations.",2023-10-24T02:25:16Z,2023-10-24T02:25:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15463v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15463v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Identification of stormwater control strategies and their associated   uncertainties using Bayesian Optimization,"Abhiram Mullapudi, Branko Kerkez","Dynamic control is emerging as an effective methodology for operating stormwater systems under stress from rapidly evolving weather patterns. Informed by rainfall predictions and real-time sensor measurements, control assets in the stormwater network can be dynamically configured to tune the behavior of the stormwater network to reduce the risk of urban flooding, equalize flows to the water reclamation facilities, and protect the receiving water bodies. However, developing such control strategies requires significant human and computational resources, and a methodology does not yet exist for quantifying the risks associated with implementing these control strategies. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization-based approach for identifying stormwater control strategies and estimating the associated uncertainties. We evaluate the efficacy of this approach in identifying viable control strategies in a simulated environment on real-world inspired combined and separated stormwater networks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach by comparing it against a Genetic algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the Bayesian Optimization-based approach to quantify the uncertainty associated with the identified control strategies and evaluate it on a synthetic stormwater network. To our knowledge, this is the first-ever stormwater control methodology that quantifies uncertainty associated with the identified control actions.

A Fault-Tolerant Integrated Vehicle Stability Control Using Adaptive   Control Allocation,"Ozan Temiz, Melih Cakmakci, Yildiray Yildiz","The focus of this paper is an integrated, fault-tolerant vehicle supervisory control algorithm for the overall stability of ground vehicles. Vehicle control systems contain many sensors and actuators that can communicate with each other over communication networks. The proposed supervisory control scheme is composed of a high-level controller that creates a virtual control input vector and a low-level control allocator that distributes the virtual control effort among redundant actuators. Virtual control input incorporates the required traction force, yaw, pitch, and roll moment corrections, and the lateral force correction to ensure stability while following a maneuvering reference initiated by the driver. Based on the virtual control input vector, the allocation module determines front steering angle correction, rear steering angle, traction forces at each tire, and active suspension forces. The proposed control framework distinguishes itself from earlier results in the literature by its ability to adapt to failures and uncertainties by updating its parameters online, without the need for fault identification. The control structure is validated in the simulation environment using a fourteen degree of freedom nonlinear vehicle model.

Inventory Consensus Control in Supply Chain Networks using   Dissipativity-Based Control and Topology Co-Design,"Shirantha Welikala, Hai Lin, Panos J.

Typically, SCNs are viewed as static entities regularly optimized to maintain their optimal operation. However, the dynamic nature of SCNs and their associated uncertainties have motivated researchers to treat SCNs as dynamic networked systems requiring robust control techniques. In this paper, we address the SCN inventory consensus problem, which aims to synchronize multiple parallel supply chains, enhancing coordination and robustness of the overall SCN. To achieve this, we take a novel approach exploiting dissipativity theory. In particular, we propose a dissipativity-based co-design strategy for distributed consensus controllers and communication topology in SCNs. It requires only the dissipativity information of the individual supply chains and involves solving a set of convex optimization problems, thus contributing to scalability, compositionality, and computational efficiency. Moreover, it optimizes the robustness of the SCN to various associated uncertainties, mitigating both bullwhip and ripple effects.

Temporal Logic Trees for Model Checking and Control Synthesis of   Uncertain Discrete-time Systems,"Yulong Gao, Alessandro Abate, Frank J. Jiang, Mirco Giacobbe, Lihua Xie, Karl H. Johansson","We propose algorithms for performing model checking and control synthesis for discrete-time uncertain systems under linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. We construct temporal logic trees (TLT) from LTL formulae via reachability analysis. In contrast to automaton-based methods, the construction of the TLT is abstraction-free for infinite systems, that is, we do not construct discrete abstractions of the infinite systems. Moreover, for a given transition system and an LTL formula, we prove that there exist both a universal TLT and an existential TLT via minimal and maximal reachability analysis, respectively. We show that the universal TLT is an underapproximation for the LTL formula and the existential TLT is an overapproximation. We provide sufficient conditions and necessary conditions to verify whether a transition system satisfies an LTL formula by using the TLT approximations. As a major contribution of this work, for a controlled transition system and an LTL formula, we prove that a controlled TLT can be constructed from the LTL formula via control-dependent reachability analysis. Based on the controlled TLT, we design an online control synthesis algorithm, under which a set of feasible control inputs can be generated at each time step. We also prove that this algorithm is recursively feasible. We illustrate the proposed methods for both finite and infinite systems and highlight the generality and online scalability with two simulated examples.",2020-07-05T09:32:34Z,2020-07-05T09:32:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02271v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02271v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Computing robust control invariant sets of constrained nonlinear   systems: A graph algorithm approach,"Benjamin Decardi-Nelson, Jinfeng Liu","This paper deals with the computation of the largest robust control invariant sets (RCISs) of constrained nonlinear systems. The proposed approach is based on casting the search for the invariant set as a graph theoretical problem. Specifically, a general class of discrete-time time-invariant nonlinear systems is considered. First, the dynamics of a nonlinear system is approximated with a directed graph. Subsequently, the condition for robust control invariance is derived and an algorithm for computing the robust control invariant set is presented. The algorithm combines the iterative subdivision technique with the robust control invariance condition to produce outer approximations of the largest robust control invariant set at each iteration. Following this, we prove convergence of the algorithm to the largest RCIS as the iterations proceed to infinity. Based on the developed algorithms, an algorithm to compute inner approximations of the RCIS is also presented. A special case of input affine and disturbance affine systems is also considered. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",2020-09-28T18:56:12Z,2020-09-28T18:56:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13581v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13581v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, math.DS"
Cooperative Tuning of Multi-Agent Optimal Control Systems,"Zehui Lu, Wanxin Jin, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian D. O. Anderson","This paper investigates the problem of cooperative tuning of multi-agent optimal control systems, where a network of agents (i.e. multiple coupled optimal control systems) adjusts parameters in their dynamics, objective functions, or controllers in a coordinated way to minimize the sum of their loss functions. Different from classical techniques for tuning parameters in a controller, we allow tunable parameters appearing in both the system dynamics and the objective functions of each agent. A framework is developed to allow all agents to reach a consensus on the tunable parameter, which minimizes team loss. The key idea of the proposed algorithm rests on the integration of consensus-based distributed optimization for a multi-agent system and a gradient generator capturing the optimal performance as a function of the parameter in the feedback loop tuning the parameter for each agent. Both theoretical results and simulations for a synchronous multi-agent rendezvous problem are provided to validate the proposed method for cooperative tuning of multi-agent optimal control.",2022-09-24T14:28:42Z,2022-09-24T14:28:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12017v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12017v1,"eess.SY, cs.MA, cs.SY"

Computationally Efficient System Level Tube-MPC for Uncertain Systems,"Jerome Sieber, Alexandre Didier, Melanie N. Zeilinger","Tube-based model predictive control (MPC) is the principal robust control technique for constrained linear systems affected by additive disturbances. While tube-based methods that compute the tubes online have been successfully applied to systems with additive disturbances, their application to systems affected by additional model uncertainties is challenging. This paper introduces a new tube-based MPC method - named filter-based system level tube-MPC (SLTMPC) - which overapproximates both uncertainties with an online optimized disturbance set, while simultaneously computing the tube controller online. Extending prior work, we generalize the method to polytopic disturbance sets and for the first time provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees for the receding horizon controller. These guarantees are obtained by virtue of a new terminal controller design and an online optimized terminal set. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method, we additionally introduce an asynchronous computation scheme that separates the optimization of the tube controller and the nominal trajectory.

Leader-follower Tracking Control with Guaranteed Consensus Performance   for Interconnected Systems with Linear Dynamic Uncertain Coupling,"Yi Cheng, V. Ugrinovskii","This paper considers the leader-follower tracking control problem for linear interconnected systems with undirected topology and linear dynamic coupling. Interactions between the systems are treated as linear dynamic uncertainty and are described in terms of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A consensus-type tracking control protocol is proposed for each system based on its state relative its neighbors. In addition a selected set of subsystems uses for control their relative states with respect to the leader. Two methods are proposed for the design of this control protocol. One method uses a coordinate transformation to recast the protocol design problem as a decentralized robust control problem for an auxiliary interconnected large scale system. Another method is direct, it does not employ coordinate transformation; it also allows for more general linear uncertain interactions. Using these methods, sufficient conditions are obtained which guarantee that the system tracks the leader. These conditions guarantee a suboptimal bound on the system consensus and tracking performance. The proposed methods are compared using a simulation example, and their effectiveness is discussed. Also, algorithms are proposed for computing suboptimal controllers.",2015-02-14T12:51:50Z,2015-02-14T12:51:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04205v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04205v1,cs.SY

Traditional DeePC methods use pre-collected input/output (I/O) data to construct Hankel matrices for online predictive control. However, in systems with evolving dynamics or insufficient pre-collected data, incorporating real-time data into the DeePC framework becomes crucial to enhance control performance. This paper proposes an online DeePC framework for time-varying systems (i.e., systems with evolving dynamics), enabling the algorithm to update the Hankel matrix online by adding real-time informative signals. By exploiting the minimum non-zero singular value of the Hankel matrix, the developed online DeePC selectively integrates informative data and effectively captures evolving system dynamics. Additionally, a numerical singular value decomposition technique is introduced to reduce the computational complexity for updating a reduced-order Hankel matrix.

Robust Stabilization of Resource Limited Networked Control Systems Under   Denial-of-Service Attack,"Niladri Sekhar Tripathy, Mohammadreza Chamanbaz, Roland Bouffanais","In this paper, we consider a class of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which aims at overloading the communication channel. On top of the security issue, continuous or periodic transmission of information within feedback loop is necessary for the effective control and stabilization of the system. In addition, uncertainty---originating from variation of parameters or unmodeled system dynamics---plays a key role in the system's stability. To address these three critical factors, we solve the joint control and security problem for an uncertain discrete-time Networked Control System (NCS) subject to limited availability of the shared communication channel. An event-triggered-based control and communication strategy is adopted to reduce bandwidth consumption. To tackle the uncertainty in the system dynamics, a robust control law is derived using an optimal control approach based on a virtual nominal dynamics associated with a quadratic cost-functional. The conditions for closed-loop stability and aperiodic transmission rule of feedback information are derived using the discrete-time Input-to-State Stability theory.

The purpose of this paper is to design a coherent feedback controller for a class of linear quantum systems suffering from Markovian jumping faults so that the closed-loop quantum system has both fault tolerance and H-infinity disturbance attenuation performance. This paper first extends the physical realization conditions from the time-invariant case to the time-varying case for linear stochastic quantum systems. By relating the fault tolerant H-infinity control problem to the dissipation properties and the solutions of Riccati differential equations, an H-infinity controller for the quantum system is then designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In particular, an algorithm is employed to introduce additional noises and to construct the corresponding input matrices to ensure the physical realizability of the quantum controller. For real applications of the developed fault-tolerant control strategy, we present a linear quantum system example from quantum optics, where the amplitude of the pumping field randomly jumps among different values.

Fast and Optimal Adaptive Tracking Control: A Novel Meta-Reinforcement   Learning via Conditional Generative Adversarial Net,"Mohammad Mahmoudi, Nasser Sadati","The control of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics has been a significant field of research for many years. This paper presents a novel data-driven optimal adaptive control structure with less control effort and faster adaptation than standard adaptive control counterparts. The proposed control structure utilizes the system's recorded data to increase the speed of adaptation and performance dramatically. In this study, we employ a conditional generative adversarial net (CGAN) as a novel central pattern generator to reproduce the steady-state harmonic pattern of the control signals matching the system's uncertainties over a wide range. We can also use the CGAN architecture as a fault detector. The CGAN provides a low-dimensional latent space of uncertainties. It enables rapid and convenient adaptation when there are many parametric uncertainties, especially for large-scale systems. Then, we introduce a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework to adapt the latent space of CGAN to the system's uncertainties as an optimal direct adaptive controller without any system identifier. Another part of the control structure is a regulator that achieves semi-global asymptotic tracking using the Lyapunov stability analysis.

Data-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning for Attitude Control of   Fixed-Wing UAVs: Field Experiments,"Eivind Bøhn, Erlend M. Coates, Dirk Reinhardt, Tor Arne Johansen","Attitude control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a difficult control problem in part due to uncertain nonlinear dynamics, actuator constraints, and coupled longitudinal and lateral motions. Current state-of-the-art autopilots are based on linear control and are thus limited in their effectiveness and performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a machine learning method to automatically discover optimal control laws through interaction with the controlled system, which can handle complex nonlinear dynamics. We show in this paper that DRL can successfully learn to perform attitude control of a fixed-wing UAV operating directly on the original nonlinear dynamics, requiring as little as three minutes of flight data. We initially train our model in a simulation environment and then deploy the learned controller on the UAV in flight tests, demonstrating comparable performance to the state-of-the-art ArduPlane proportional-integral-derivative (PID) attitude controller with no further online learning required. Learning with significant actuation delay and diversified simulated dynamics were found to be crucial for successful transfer to control of the real UAV.

Null controllability of one-dimensional barotropic and non-barotropic   linearized compressible Navier-Stokes system using one boundary control,Jiten Kumbhakar,"In this article, we study boundary null controllability properties of the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the interval $(0,2\pi)$ for both barotropic and non-barotropic fluids using only one boundary control. We consider all the possible cases of the act of control for both systems (density, velocity and temperature). These controls are acting on the boundary and are given as the difference of the values at $x=0$ and $x=2\pi$. In this setup, using a boundary control acting in density, we first prove null controllability of both the barotropic and non-barotropic systems at large time in the spaces $(\dot{L}^2(0,2\pi))^2$ and $(\dot{L}^2(0,2\pi))^3$ respectively (where the dot represents functions with mean value zero). When the control is acting in the velocity component, we prove null controllability at large time in the spaces $\dot{H}^1_{\text{per}}(0,2\pi)\times\dot{L}^2(0,2\pi)$ and $\dot{H}^1_{\text{per}}(0,2\pi)\times(\dot{L}^2(0,2\pi))^2$ respectively. Further, in both cases, we prove that these null controllability results are sharp with respect to the regularity of the initial states in velocity/ temperature case, and time in the density case. Finally, for both barotropic and non-barotropic fluids, we prove that, under some assumptions, the system cannot be approximately controllable at any time, whether there is a control acting in density, velocity or temperature.",2023-01-10T17:11:30Z,2024-01-24T16:46:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04080v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04080v2,"math.AP, math.OC"
Design Of Fuzzy Logic Traffic Controller For Isolated Intersections With   Emergency Vehicle Priority System Using MATLAB Simulation,"Mohit Jha, Shailja Shukla","Traffic is the chief puzzle problem which every country faces because of the enhancement in number of vehicles throughout the world, especially in large urban towns. Hence the need arises for simulating and optimizing traffic control algorithms to better accommodate this increasing demand. Fuzzy optimization deals with finding the values of input parameters of a complex simulated system which result in desired output. This paper presents a MATLAB simulation of fuzzy logic traffic controller for controlling flow of traffic in isolated intersections. This controller is based on the waiting time and queue length of vehicles at present green phase and vehicles queue lengths at the other phases. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase difference to ascertain sebaceous flow of traffic with least waiting time and queue length. In this paper, the isolated intersection model used consists of two alleyways in each approach. Every outlook has different value of queue length and waiting time, systematically, at the intersection. The maximum value of waiting time and vehicle queue length has to be selected by using proximity sensors as inputs to controller for the ameliorate control traffic flow at the intersection. An intelligent traffic model and fuzzy logic traffic controller are developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controller under different pre-defined conditions for oleaginous flow of traffic. Additionally, this fuzzy logic traffic controller has emergency vehicle siren sensors which detect emergency vehicle movement like ambulance, fire brigade, Police Van etc. and gives maximum priority to him and pass preferred signal to it.",2014-05-05T15:47:31Z,2014-05-05T15:47:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0936v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0936v1,"cs.AI, cs.SY"
Fuzzy Discrete Event Systems under Fuzzy Observability and a   test-algorithm,"Daowen Qiu, Fuchun Liu","In order to more effectively cope with the real-world problems of vagueness, impreciseness, and subjectivity, fuzzy discrete event systems (FDESs) were proposed recently. Notably, FDESs have been applied to biomedical control for HIV/AIDS treatment planning and sensory information processing for robotic control. Qiu, Cao and Ying independently developed supervisory control theory of FDESs. We note that the controllability of events in Qiu's work is fuzzy but the observability of events is crisp, and, the observability of events in Cao and Ying's work is also crisp although the controllability is not completely crisp since the controllable events can be disabled with any degrees. Motivated by the necessity to consider the situation that the events may be observed or controlled with some membership degrees, in this paper, we establish the supervisory control theory of FDESs with partial observations, in which both the observability and controllability of events are fuzzy instead. We formalize the notions of fuzzy controllability condition and fuzzy observability condition. And Controllability and Observability Theorem of FDESs is set up in a more generic framework. In particular, we present a detailed computing flow to verify whether the controllability and observability conditions hold. Thus, this result can decide the existence of supervisors. Also, we use this computing method to check the existence of supervisors in the Controllability and Observability Theorem of classical discrete event systems (DESs), which is a new method and different from classical case.

Holistic Cyber-Physical Management for Dependable Wireless Control   Systems,"Yehan Ma, Dolvara Gunatilaka, Bo Li, Humberto Gonzalez, Chenyang Lu","Wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) are gaining momentum in industrial process automation as a communication infrastructure for lowering deployment and maintenance costs. In traditional wireless control systems the plant controller and the network manager operate in isolation, which ignore the significant influence of network reliability on plant control performance. To enhance the dependability of industrial wireless control, we propose a holistic cyber-physical management framework that employs run-time coordination between the plant control and network management. Our design includes a holistic controller that generates actuation signals to physical plants and reconfigures the WSAN to maintain desired control performance while saving wireless resources. As a concrete example of holistic control, we design a holistic manager that dynamically reconfigures the number of transmissions in the WSAN based on online observations of physical and cyber variables. We have implemented the holistic management framework in the Wireless Cyber-Physical Simulator (WCPS). A systematic case study has been presented based on two 5-state plants sharing a 16-node WSAN. Simulation results show that the holistic management design has significantly enhanced the resilience of the system against both wireless interferences and physical disturbances, while effectively reducing the number of wireless transmissions.",2017-05-04T14:45:42Z,2017-05-04T14:45:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01862v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.01862v1,cs.SY
Distributed bilayered control for transient frequency safety and system   stability in power grids,"Yifu Zhang, Jorge Cortes","This paper considers power networks governed by swing nonlinear dynamics and subject to disturbances. We develop a bilayered control strategy for a subset of buses that simultaneously guarantees transient frequency safety of each individual bus and asymptotic stability of the entire network. The bottom layer is a model predictive controller that, based on periodically sampled system information, optimizes control resources to have transient frequency evolve close to a safe desired interval. The top layer is a real-time controller assisting the bottom-layer controller to guarantee transient frequency safety is actually achieved. We show that control signals at both layers are Lipschitz in the state and do not jeopardize stability of the network. Furthermore, we carefully characterize the information requirements at each bus necessary to implement the controller and employ saddle-point dynamics to introduce a distributed implementation that only requires information exchange with up to 2-hop neighbors in the power network.

A Computationally Efficient Hamilton-Jacobi-based Formula for   State-Constrained Optimal Control Problems,"Donggun Lee, Claire J.

Although grid-based methods, such as the level-set method [1], numerically solve a general class of HJ partial differential equations, the computational complexity is exponential in the dimension of the continuous state. To manage this computational complexity, methods based on Lax-Hopf theory have been developed for the state-unconstrained optimal control problem under certain assumptions, such as affine dynamics and state-independent stage cost. Based on the Lax formula [2], this paper proposes an HJ formula for the state-constrained optimal control problem for nonlinear systems. We call this formula \textit{the generalized Lax formula} for the optimal control problem. The HJ formula provides both the optimal cost and an optimal control signal. We also provide an efficient computational method for a class of problems for which the dynamics is affine in the state, and for which the stage and terminal cost, as well as the state constraints, are convex in the state. This class of problems does not require affine dynamics and convex stage cost in the control.

Robust MPC-based energy management systems tend to under-utilize the renewable energy sources to guarantee safe operation. In order to mitigate this effect, we further consider droop control of renewable energy sources. For a microgrid with droop-controlled units, we show that enhancing droop feedback with saturation enlarges the space of feasible control actions. However, the resulting controller requires to solve a mixed-integer problem with additional variables and equations representing saturation. We derive a computationally tractable formulation for this problem. Furthermore, we investigate the performance gained by using droop with saturation, renewable droop and combination of both in a case study.",2021-07-06T16:42:13Z,2021-07-06T16:42:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02719v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02719v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"

A novel algorithm for the design of robustly invariant online terminal sets and terminal controllers is presented. Set membership identification is used to update the parameter uncertainty online. A predicted worst-case cost is used in the MPC optimization problem to model the dual effect of the control input.

"Safe Control with Learned Certificates: A Survey of Neural Lyapunov,   Barrier, and Contraction methods","Charles Dawson, Sicun Gao, Chuchu Fan","Learning-enabled control systems have demonstrated impressive empirical performance on challenging control problems in robotics, but this performance comes at the cost of reduced transparency and lack of guarantees on the safety or stability of the learned controllers. In recent years, new techniques have emerged to provide these guarantees by learning certificates alongside control policies -- these certificates provide concise, data-driven proofs that guarantee the safety and stability of the learned control system. These methods not only allow the user to verify the safety of a learned controller but also provide supervision during training, allowing safety and stability requirements to influence the training process itself. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this rapidly developing field of certificate learning.

The control Lyapunov functions are based on measures of the energy of the system with the kinetic energy expressed in ways similar to Newtonian or relativistic mechanics. The derived feedback laws (cruise controllers) are decentralized, as each vehicle determines its control input based on its own speed and on the relative speeds and distances from adjacent vehicles and from the boundary of the road. Moreover, the corresponding macroscopic models are derived, obtaining fluid-like models that consist of a conservation equation and a momentum equation with pressure and viscous terms.

To address such a limitation, this paper proposes a novel design combining an extended state observer (ESO) with a CBF for safe control of a system with model uncertainty and external disturbances only using output measurement. Our approach provides a less conservative estimation error bound than other disturbance observer-based CBFs. Moreover, only output measurements are needed to estimate the disturbances instead of access to the full state. The bounds of state estimation error and disturbance estimation error are obtained in a unified manner and then used for robust safe control under uncertainty.

The lattice piecewise affine(PWA) function was used to represent the control law of explicit MPC, although the online calculation complexity is reduced, the offline calculation is still prohibitive for complex problems. In this paper, we use the sample points in the feasible region with their corresponding affine functions to construct the lattice PWA approximation of the optimal MPC controller designed for satellite attitude control.

The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each state and input constraint.

However, guaranteeing the safety and reliability of CPSs with this kind of controllers is currently very challenging, which is of vital importance in many real-life safety-critical applications. To cope with this difficulty, we propose in this work a Safe-visor architecture for sandboxing unverified controllers in CPSs operating in noisy environments (a.k.a. stochastic CPSs). The proposed architecture contains a history-based supervisor, which checks inputs from the unverified controller and makes a compromise between functionality and safety of the system, and a safety advisor that provides fallback when the unverified controller endangers the safety of the system. Both the history-based supervisor and the safety advisor are designed based on an approximate probabilistic relation between the original system and its finite abstraction. By employing this architecture, we provide formal probabilistic guarantees on preserving the safety specifications expressed by accepting languages of deterministic finite automata (DFA). Meanwhile, the unverified controllers can still be employed in the control loop even though they are not reliable.

Design and Implementation of Data-driven Predictive Cloud Control System,"Runze Gao, Yuanqing Xia, Li Dai, Zhongqi Sun","Nowadays, the rapid increases of the scale and complexity of the controlled plants bring new challenges such as computing power and storage for conventional control systems. Cloud computing is concerned as a powerful solution to handle the complex large-scale control missions using sufficient computing resources. However, the developed computing ability enables more complex devices and mass data being involved and thus the applications of model-based algorithms are constrained. Motivated by the above, we propose an original data-driven predictive cloud control system. To achieve the proposed system, a practical data-driven predictive cloud control platform rather than only a numerical simulator is established and together a cloud-edge communication scheme is developed. Finally, the verification of simulations and experiments as well as discussions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.",2021-12-29T01:05:50Z,2021-12-29T01:05:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14347v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14347v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Energy cost for target control of complex networks,"Gaopeng Duan, Aming Li, Tao Meng, Long Wang","To promote the implementation of realistic control over various complex networks, recent work has been focusing on analyzing energy cost. Indeed, the energy cost quantifies how much effort is required to drive the system from one state to another when it is fully controllable. A fully controllable system means that the system can be driven by external inputs from any initial state to any final state in finite time. However, it is prohibitively expensive and unnecessary to confine that the system is fully controllable when we merely need to accomplish the so-called target control---controlling a subnet of nodes chosen from the entire network. Yet, when the system is partially controllable, the associated energy cost remains elusive. Here we present the minimum energy cost for controlling an arbitrary subset of nodes of a network. Moreover, we systematically show the scaling behavior of the precise upper and lower bounds of the minimum energy in term of the time given to accomplish control. For controlling a given number of target nodes, we further demonstrate that the associated energy over different configurations can differ by several orders of magnitude. When the adjacency matrix of the network is nonsingular, we can simplify the framework by just considering the induced subgraph spanned by target nodes instead of the entire network. Importantly, we find that, energy cost could be saved by orders of magnitude as we only need the partial controllability of the entire network. Our theoretical results are all corroborated by numerical calculations, and pave the way for estimating the energy cost to implement realistic target control in various applications.",2019-07-15T09:52:24Z,2019-07-15T09:52:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06401v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06401v1,math.OC
Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control Problems for Mean-Field Stochastic   Differential Equations with Jumps,"Maoning Tang, Qingxin Meng","In this paper, we study a linear-quadratic optimal control problem for mean-field stochastic differential equations driven by a Poisson random martingale measure and a multidimensional Brownian motion. Firstly, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control is obtained by the classic convex variation principle. Secondly, by the duality method, the optimality system, also called the stochastic Hamilton system which turns out to be a linear fully coupled mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equation with jumps, is derived to characterize the optimal control. Thirdly, applying a decoupling technique, we establish the connection between two Riccati equation and the stochastic Hamilton system and then prove the optimal control has a state feedback representation.",2016-10-11T05:20:48Z,2016-10-11T05:20:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03193v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03193v1,math.OC

Expectation-Maximization Based Defense Mechanism for Distributed Model   Predictive Control,"Rafael Accácio Nogueira, Romain Bourdais, Simon Leglaive, Hervé Guéguen",Controlling large-scale systems sometimes requires decentralized computation. Communication among agents is crucial to achieving consensus and optimal global behavior. These negotiation mechanisms are sensitive to attacks on those exchanges. This paper proposes an algorithm based on Expectation Maximization to mitigate the effects of attacks in a resource allocation based distributed model predictive control. The performance is assessed through an academic example of the temperature control of multiple rooms under input power constraints.,2022-07-17T14:54:45Z,2022-07-17T14:54:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08194v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08194v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Robust Adaptive Geometric Tracking Controls on SO(3) with an Application   to the Attitude Dynamics of a Quadrotor UAV,Taeyoung Lee,"This paper provides new results for a robust adaptive tracking control of the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. Both of the attitude dynamics and the proposed control system are globally expressed on the special orthogonal group, to avoid complexities and ambiguities associated with other attitude representations such as Euler angles or quaternions. By designing an adaptive law for the inertia matrix of a rigid body, the proposed control system can asymptotically follow an attitude command without the knowledge of the inertia matrix, and it is extended to guarantee boundedness of tracking errors in the presence of unstructured disturbances. These are illustrated by numerical examples and experiments for the attitude dynamics of a quadrotor UAV.",2011-08-30T18:23:06Z,2011-08-30T18:23:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.6031v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.6031v1,"math.OC, cs.SY"
Locally optimal controllers and globally inverse optimal controllers,"Sofiane Benachour, Humberto Stein Shiromoto, Vincent Andrieu","In this paper we consider the problem of global asymptotic stabilization with prescribed local behavior. We show that this problem can be formulated in terms of control Lyapunov functions. Moreover, we show that if the local control law has been synthesized employing a LQ approach, then the associated Lyapunov function can be seen as the value function of an optimal problem with some specific local properties. We illustrate these results on two specific classes of systems: backstepping and feedforward systems. Finally, we show how this framework can be employed when considering the orbital transfer problem.",2015-02-11T19:58:34Z,2015-02-11T19:58:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03415v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03415v1,"math.OC, cs.SY"
Controller design for robust invariance from noisy data,"Andrea Bisoffi, Claudio De Persis, Pietro Tesi","For an unknown linear system, starting from noisy open-loop input-state data collected during a finite-length experiment, we directly design a linear feedback controller that guarantees robust invariance of a given polyhedral set of the state in the presence of disturbances.

Learning Rigidity-based Flocking Control with Gaussian Processes,"Manuela Gamonal, Thomas Beckers, George J. Pappas, Leonardo J. Colombo",Flocking control of multi-agents system is challenging for agents with partially unknown dynamics. This paper proposes an online learning-based controller to stabilize flocking motion of double-integrator agents with additional unknown nonlinear dynamics by using Gaussian processes (GP). Agents interaction is described by a time-invariant infinitesimally minimally rigid undirected graph. We provide a decentralized control law that exponentially stabilizes the motion of the agents and captures Reynolds boids motion for swarms by using GPs as an online learning-based oracle for the prediction of the unknown dynamics. In particular the presented approach guarantees a probabilistic bounded tracking error with high probability.,2021-12-14T22:57:39Z,2021-12-14T22:57:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07779v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07779v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
