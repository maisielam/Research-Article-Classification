HyperCon: Image-To-Video Model Transfer for Video-To-Video Translation   Tasks,"Ryan Szeto, Mostafa El-Khamy, Jungwon Lee, Jason J. Corso","Video-to-video translation is more difficult than image-to-image translation due to the temporal consistency problem that, if unaddressed, leads to distracting flickering effects. Although video models designed from scratch produce temporally consistent results, training them to match the vast visual knowledge captured by image models requires an intractable number of videos. To combine the benefits of image and video models, we propose an image-to-video model transfer method called Hyperconsistency (HyperCon) that transforms any well-trained image model into a temporally consistent video model without fine-tuning. HyperCon works by translating a temporally interpolated video frame-wise and then aggregating over temporally localized windows on the interpolated video. It handles both masked and unmasked inputs, enabling support for even more video-to-video translation tasks than prior image-to-video model transfer techniques. We demonstrate HyperCon on video style transfer and inpainting, where it performs favorably compared to prior state-of-the-art methods without training on a single stylized or incomplete video.

Analyzing Zero-Shot Abilities of Vision-Language Models on Video   Understanding Tasks,"Avinash Madasu, Anahita Bhiwandiwalla, Vasudev Lal","Foundational multimodal models pre-trained on large scale image-text pairs or video-text pairs or both have shown strong generalization abilities on downstream tasks. However unlike image-text models, pretraining video-text models is always not feasible due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale clean and aligned data, and exponential computational costs involved in the pretraining phase. Therefore, the pertinent question to ask is: Can image-text models be adapted to video tasks and is there any benefit to using these models over pretraining directly on videos? In this work, we focus on this question by proposing a detailed study on the generalization abilities of image-text models when evaluated on video understanding tasks in a zero-shot setting. We investigate 9 foundational image-text models on a diverse set of video tasks that include video action recognition (video AR), video retrieval (video RT), video question answering (video QA), video multiple choice (video MC) and video captioning (video CP). Our experiments show that image-text models exhibit impressive performance on video AR, video RT and video MC. Furthermore, they perform moderately on video captioning and poorly on video QA. These findings shed a light on the benefits of adapting foundational image-text models to an array of video tasks while avoiding the costly pretraining step.",2023-10-07T20:57:54Z,2023-11-24T22:25:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04914v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04914v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL"
"State-of-the-art in 360° Video/Image Processing: Perception,   Assessment and Compression","Chen Li, Mai Xu, Shanyi Zhang, Patrick Le Callet","Nowadays, 360{\deg} video/image has been increasingly popular and drawn great attention. The spherical viewing range of 360{\deg} video/image accounts for huge data, which pose the challenges to 360{\deg} video/image processing in solving the bottleneck of storage, transmission, etc. Accordingly, the recent years have witnessed the explosive emergence of works on 360{\deg} video/image processing. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art works on 360{\deg} video/image processing from the aspects of perception, assessment and compression. First, this paper reviews both datasets and visual attention modelling approaches for 360{\deg} video/image. Second, we survey the related works on both subjective and objective visual quality assessment (VQA) of 360{\deg} video/image.

Two Decades of Colorization and Decolorization for Images and Videos,Shiguang Liu,"Colorization is a computer-aided process, which aims to give color to a gray image or video. It can be used to enhance black-and-white images, including black-and-white photos, old-fashioned films, and scientific imaging results. On the contrary, decolorization is to convert a color image or video into a grayscale one. A grayscale image or video refers to an image or video with only brightness information without color information. It is the basis of some downstream image processing applications such as pattern recognition, image segmentation, and image enhancement. Different from image decolorization, video decolorization should not only consider the image contrast preservation in each video frame, but also respect the temporal and spatial consistency between video frames. Researchers were devoted to develop decolorization methods by balancing spatial-temporal consistency and algorithm efficiency. With the prevalance of the digital cameras and mobile phones, image and video colorization and decolorization have been paid more and more attention by researchers. This paper gives an overview of the progress of image and video colorization and decolorization methods in the last two decades.",2022-04-28T07:43:52Z,2022-07-18T09:22:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13322v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13322v2,"cs.CV, cs.GR"
Fewer Tokens and Fewer Videos: Extending Video Understanding Abilities   in Large Vision-Language Models,"Shimin Chen, Yitian Yuan, Shaoxiang Chen, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma","Amidst the advancements in image-based Large Vision-Language Models (image-LVLM), the transition to video-based models (video-LVLM) is hindered by the limited availability of quality video data. This paper addresses the challenge by leveraging the visual commonalities between images and videos to efficiently evolve image-LVLMs into video-LVLMs. We present a cost-effective video-LVLM that enhances model architecture, introduces innovative training strategies, and identifies the most effective types of video instruction data. Our innovative weighted token sampler significantly compresses the visual token numbers of each video frame, effectively cutting computational expenses. We also find that judiciously using just 10% of the video data, compared to prior video-LVLMs, yields impressive results during various training phases. Moreover, we delve into the influence of video instruction data in limited-resource settings, highlighting the significance of incorporating video training data that emphasizes temporal understanding to enhance model performance. The resulting Fewer Tokens and Fewer Videos LVLM (FTFV-LVLM) exhibits exceptional performance across video and image benchmarks, validating our model's design and training approaches.",2024-06-12T09:22:45Z,2024-06-12T09:22:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08024v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08024v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
OmniVL:One Foundation Model for Image-Language and Video-Language Tasks,"Junke Wang, Dongdong Chen, Zuxuan Wu, Chong Luo, Luowei Zhou, Yucheng Zhao, Yujia Xie, Ce Liu, Yu-Gang Jiang, Lu Yuan","This paper presents OmniVL, a new foundation model to support both image-language and video-language tasks using one universal architecture. It adopts a unified transformer-based visual encoder for both image and video inputs, and thus can perform joint image-language and video-language pretraining. We demonstrate, for the first time, such a paradigm benefits both image and video tasks, as opposed to the conventional one-directional transfer (e.g., use image-language to help video-language). To this end, we propose a decoupled joint pretraining of image-language and video-language to effectively decompose the vision-language modeling into spatial and temporal dimensions and obtain performance boost on both image and video tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel unified vision-language contrastive (UniVLC) loss to leverage image-text, video-text, image-label (e.g., image classification), video-label (e.g., video action recognition) data together, so that both supervised and noisily supervised pretraining data are utilized as much as possible. Without incurring extra task-specific adaptors, OmniVL can simultaneously support visual only tasks (e.g., image classification, video action recognition), cross-modal alignment tasks (e.g., image/video-text retrieval), and multi-modal understanding and generation tasks (e.g., image/video question answering, captioning). We evaluate OmniVL on a wide range of downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results with similar model size and data scale.",2022-09-15T17:59:59Z,2022-10-19T21:03:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07526v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07526v2,cs.CV
BIVDiff: A Training-Free Framework for General-Purpose Video Synthesis   via Bridging Image and Video Diffusion Models,"Fengyuan Shi, Jiaxi Gu, Hang Xu, Songcen Xu, Wei Zhang, Limin Wang","Diffusion models have made tremendous progress in text-driven image and video generation. Now text-to-image foundation models are widely applied to various downstream image synthesis tasks, such as controllable image generation and image editing, while downstream video synthesis tasks are less explored for several reasons. First, it requires huge memory and computation overhead to train a video generation foundation model. Even with video foundation models, additional costly training is still required for downstream video synthesis tasks. Second, although some works extend image diffusion models into videos in a training-free manner, temporal consistency cannot be well preserved. Finally, these adaption methods are specifically designed for one task and fail to generalize to different tasks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a training-free general-purpose video synthesis framework, coined as {\bf BIVDiff}, via bridging specific image diffusion models and general text-to-video foundation diffusion models. Specifically, we first use a specific image diffusion model (e.g., ControlNet and Instruct Pix2Pix) for frame-wise video generation, then perform Mixed Inversion on the generated video, and finally input the inverted latents into the video diffusion models (e.g., VidRD and ZeroScope) for temporal smoothing. This decoupled framework enables flexible image model selection for different purposes with strong task generalization and high efficiency. To validate the effectiveness and general use of BIVDiff, we perform a wide range of video synthesis tasks, including controllable video generation, video editing, video inpainting, and outpainting.",2023-12-05T14:56:55Z,2024-04-09T09:12:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02813v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02813v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
An Overview of Color Transfer and Style Transfer for Images and Videos,Shiguang Liu,"Image or video appearance features (e.g., color, texture, tone, illumination, and so on) reflect one's visual perception and direct impression of an image or video. Given a source image (video) and a target image (video), the image (video) color transfer technique aims to process the color of the source image or video (note that the source image or video is also referred to the reference image or video in some literature) to make it look like that of the target image or video, i.e., transferring the appearance of the target image or video to that of the source image or video, which can thereby change one's perception of the source image or video. As an extension of color transfer, style transfer refers to rendering the content of a target image or video in the style of an artist with either a style sample or a set of images through a style transfer model. As an emerging field, the study of style transfer has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers. After decades of development, it has become a highly interdisciplinary research with a variety of artistic expression styles can be achieved. This paper provides an overview of color transfer and style transfer methods over the past years.",2022-04-28T08:20:54Z,2022-07-19T04:08:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13339v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13339v3,"cs.CV, cs.GR"
Deep Priors for Video Quality Prediction,"Siddharath Narayan Shakya, Parimala Kancharla","In this work, we designed a completely blind video quality assessment algorithm using the deep video prior. This work mainly explores the utility of deep video prior in estimating the visual quality of the video. In our work, we have used a single distorted video and a reference video pair to learn the deep video prior. At inference time, the learned deep prior is used to restore the original videos from the distorted videos. The ability of learned deep video prior to restore the original video from the distorted video is measured to quantify distortion in the video. Our hypothesis is that the learned deep video prior fails in restoring the highly distorted videos. The restoring ability of deep video prior is proportional to the distortion present in the video. Therefore, we propose to use the distance between the distorted video and the restored video as the perceptual quality of the video. Our algorithm is trained using a single video pair and it does not need any labelled data. We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing unsupervised video quality assessment algorithms in terms of LCC and SROCC on a synthetically distorted video quality assessment dataset.",2024-10-29T22:15:03Z,2024-11-05T13:21:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22566v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22566v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Face Translation between Images and Videos using Identity-aware CycleGAN,"Zhiwu Huang, Bernhard Kratzwald, Danda Pani Paudel, Jiqing Wu, Luc Van Gool","This paper presents a new problem of unpaired face translation between images and videos, which can be applied to facial video prediction and enhancement. In this problem there exist two major technical challenges: 1) designing a robust translation model between static images and dynamic videos, and 2) preserving facial identity during image-video translation. To address such two problems, we generalize the state-of-the-art image-to-image translation network (Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks) to the image-to-video/video-to-image translation context by exploiting a image-video translation model and an identity preservation model. In particular, we apply the state-of-the-art Wasserstein GAN technique to the setting of image-video translation for better convergence, and we meanwhile introduce a face verificator to ensure the identity. Experiments on standard image/video face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",2017-12-04T09:27:14Z,2017-12-04T09:27:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00971v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00971v1,cs.CV
SinFusion: Training Diffusion Models on a Single Image or Video,"Yaniv Nikankin, Niv Haim, Michal Irani","Diffusion models exhibited tremendous progress in image and video generation, exceeding GANs in quality and diversity. However, they are usually trained on very large datasets and are not naturally adapted to manipulate a given input image or video. In this paper we show how this can be resolved by training a diffusion model on a single input image or video. Our image/video-specific diffusion model (SinFusion) learns the appearance and dynamics of the single image or video, while utilizing the conditioning capabilities of diffusion models. It can solve a wide array of image/video-specific manipulation tasks. In particular, our model can learn from few frames the motion and dynamics of a single input video. It can then generate diverse new video samples of the same dynamic scene, extrapolate short videos into long ones (both forward and backward in time) and perform video upsampling. Most of these tasks are not realizable by current video-specific generation methods.",2022-11-21T18:59:33Z,2023-06-19T08:30:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11743v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11743v3,"cs.CV, cs.LG"
I4VGen: Image as Free Stepping Stone for Text-to-Video Generation,"Xiefan Guo, Jinlin Liu, Miaomiao Cui, Liefeng Bo, Di Huang","Text-to-video generation has trailed behind text-to-image generation in terms of quality and diversity, primarily due to the inherent complexities of spatio-temporal modeling and the limited availability of video-text datasets. Recent text-to-video diffusion models employ the image as an intermediate step, significantly enhancing overall performance but incurring high training costs. In this paper, we present I4VGen, a novel video diffusion inference pipeline to leverage advanced image techniques to enhance pre-trained text-to-video diffusion models, which requires no additional training. Instead of the vanilla text-to-video inference pipeline, I4VGen consists of two stages: anchor image synthesis and anchor image-augmented text-to-video synthesis. Correspondingly, a simple yet effective generation-selection strategy is employed to achieve visually-realistic and semantically-faithful anchor image, and an innovative noise-invariant video score distillation sampling (NI-VSDS) is developed to animate the image to a dynamic video by distilling motion knowledge from video diffusion models, followed by a video regeneration process to refine the video. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method produces videos with higher visual realism and textual fidelity. Furthermore, I4VGen also supports being seamlessly integrated into existing image-to-video diffusion models, thereby improving overall video quality.",2024-06-04T11:48:44Z,2024-10-03T06:36:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02230v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02230v2,cs.CV
Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation,"Wei Feng, Xin Wang, Hong Chen, Zeyang Zhang, Wenwu Zhu","Video generation has witnessed great success recently, but their application in generating long videos still remains challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining the temporal consistency of generated videos and the high memory cost during generation. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose a brave and new idea of Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation, connecting the massive video moment retrieval to the video generation task for the first time, providing a new paradigm for long video generation. The method of our work can be summarized as three steps: (i) We design sequential scene text prompts as the queries for video grounding, utilizing the massive video moment retrieval to search for video moment segments that meet the text requirements in the video database. (ii) Based on the source frames of retrieved video moment segments, we adopt video editing methods to create new video content while preserving the temporal consistency of the retrieved video. Since the editing can be conducted segment by segment, and even frame by frame, it largely reduces the memory cost. (iii) We also attempt video morphing and personalized generation methods to improve the subject consistency of long video generation, providing ablation experimental results for the subtasks of long video generation. Our approach seamlessly extends the development in image/video editing, video morphing and personalized generation, and video grounding to the long video generation, offering effective solutions for generating long videos at low memory cost.",2024-07-18T07:05:05Z,2024-07-18T07:05:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13219v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13219v1,cs.CV
INR-V: A Continuous Representation Space for Video-based Generative   Tasks,"Bipasha Sen, Aditya Agarwal, Vinay P Namboodiri, C. V. Jawahar","Generating videos is a complex task that is accomplished by generating a set of temporally coherent images frame-by-frame. This limits the expressivity of videos to only image-based operations on the individual video frames needing network designs to obtain temporally coherent trajectories in the underlying image space. We propose INR-V, a video representation network that learns a continuous space for video-based generative tasks. INR-V parameterizes videos using implicit neural representations (INRs), a multi-layered perceptron that predicts an RGB value for each input pixel location of the video. The INR is predicted using a meta-network which is a hypernetwork trained on neural representations of multiple video instances. Later, the meta-network can be sampled to generate diverse novel videos enabling many downstream video-based generative tasks. Interestingly, we find that conditional regularization and progressive weight initialization play a crucial role in obtaining INR-V. The representation space learned by INR-V is more expressive than an image space showcasing many interesting properties not possible with the existing works. For instance, INR-V can smoothly interpolate intermediate videos between known video instances (such as intermediate identities, expressions, and poses in face videos). It can also in-paint missing portions in videos to recover temporally coherent full videos. In this work, we evaluate the space learned by INR-V on diverse generative tasks such as video interpolation, novel video generation, video inversion, and video inpainting against the existing baselines. INR-V significantly outperforms the baselines on several of these demonstrated tasks, clearly showcasing the potential of the proposed representation space.",2022-10-29T11:54:58Z,2023-04-03T02:58:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16579v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16579v2,cs.CV
AVD: Adversarial Video Distillation,"Mohammad Tavakolian, Mohammad Sabokrou, Abdenour Hadid","In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient approach for video representation, called Adversarial Video Distillation (AVD). The key idea is to represent videos by compressing them in the form of realistic images, which can be used in a variety of video-based scene analysis applications. Representing a video as a single image enables us to address the problem of video analysis by image analysis techniques. To this end, we exploit a 3D convolutional encoder-decoder network to encode the input video as an image by minimizing the reconstruction error. Furthermore, weak supervision by an adversarial training procedure is imposed on the output of the encoder to generate semantically realistic images. The encoder learns to extract semantically meaningful representations from a given input video by mapping the 3D input into a 2D latent representation. The obtained representation can be simply used as the input of deep models pre-trained on images for video classification. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method for video-based activity recognition on three standard and challenging benchmark datasets, i.e. UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics. The experimental results demonstrate that AVD achieves interesting performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for video classification.",2019-07-12T09:23:32Z,2019-07-12T09:23:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05640v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05640v1,cs.CV
TOPA: Extending Large Language Models for Video Understanding via   Text-Only Pre-Alignment,"Wei Li, Hehe Fan, Yongkang Wong, Mohan Kankanhalli, Yi Yang","Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive use of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge despite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty primarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient language supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this paper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend large language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for pre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM to automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames, along with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then, these annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with the video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we employ the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text modalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames, encoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP image features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive experiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video understanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient framework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training on any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0% on the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This performance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves competitive with recent GPT-3.5-based video agents.",2024-05-22T18:35:10Z,2024-11-03T09:25:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13911v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13911v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL"

HARP: Autoregressive Latent Video Prediction with High-Fidelity Image   Generator,"Younggyo Seo, Kimin Lee, Fangchen Liu, Stephen James, Pieter Abbeel","Video prediction is an important yet challenging problem; burdened with the tasks of generating future frames and learning environment dynamics. Recently, autoregressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video prediction tool, by separating the video prediction into two sub-problems: pre-training an image generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive prediction model in the latent space of the image generator. However, successfully generating high-fidelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be seen. In this work, we investigate how to train an autoregressive latent video prediction model capable of predicting high-fidelity future frames with minimal modification to existing models, and produce high-resolution (256x256) videos. Specifically, we scale up prior models by employing a high-fidelity image generator (VQ-GAN) with a causal transformer model, and introduce additional techniques of top-k sampling and data augmentation to further improve video prediction quality.

VVC Extension Scheme for Object Detection Using Contrast Reduction,"Takahiro Shindo, Taiju Watanabe, Kein Yamada, Hiroshi Watanabe","In recent years, video analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used, due to the remarkable development of image recognition technology using deep learning. In 2019, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has started standardization of Video Coding for Machines (VCM) as a video coding technology for image recognition. In the framework of VCM, both higher image recognition accuracy and video compression performance are required. In this paper, we propose an extention scheme of video coding for object detection using Versatile Video Coding (VVC). Unlike video for human vision, video used for object detection does not require a large image size or high contrast. Since downsampling of the image can reduce the amount of information to be transmitted. Due to the decrease in image contrast, entropy of the image becomes smaller. Therefore, in our proposed scheme, the original image is reduced in size and contrast, then coded with VVC encoder to achieve high compression performance. Then, the output image from the VVC decoder is restored to its original image size using the bicubic method. Experimental results show that the proposed video coding scheme achieves better coding performance than regular VVC in terms of object detection accuracy.",2023-05-30T06:29:04Z,2023-05-30T06:29:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18782v1,cs.CV
VideoGPT+: Integrating Image and Video Encoders for Enhanced Video   Understanding,"Muhammad Maaz, Hanoona Rasheed, Salman Khan, Fahad Khan","Building on the advances of language models, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have contributed significant improvements in video understanding. While the current video LMMs utilize advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), they rely on either image or video encoders to process visual inputs, each of which has its own limitations. Image encoders excel at capturing rich spatial details from frame sequences but lack explicit temporal context, which can be important in videos with intricate action sequences. On the other hand, video encoders provide temporal context but are often limited by computational constraints that lead to processing only sparse frames at lower resolutions, resulting in reduced contextual and spatial understanding. To this end, we introduce VideoGPT+, which combines the complementary benefits of the image encoder (for detailed spatial understanding) and the video encoder (for global temporal context modeling). The model processes videos by dividing them into smaller segments and applies an adaptive pooling strategy on features extracted by both image and video encoders. Our architecture showcases improved performance across multiple video benchmarks, including VCGBench, MVBench and Zero-shot question-answering. Further, we develop 112K video-instruction set using a novel semi-automatic annotation pipeline which further improves the model performance.

HawkEye: Training Video-Text LLMs for Grounding Text in Videos,"Yueqian Wang, Xiaojun Meng, Jianxin Liang, Yuxuan Wang, Qun Liu, Dongyan Zhao","Video-text Large Language Models (video-text LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in answering questions and holding conversations on simple videos. However, they perform almost the same as random on grounding text queries in long and complicated videos, having little ability to understand and reason about temporal information, which is the most fundamental difference between videos and images. In this paper, we propose HawkEye, one of the first video-text LLMs that can perform temporal video grounding in a fully text-to-text manner. To collect training data that is applicable for temporal video grounding, we construct InternVid-G, a large-scale video-text corpus with segment-level captions and negative spans, with which we introduce two new time-aware training objectives to video-text LLMs. We also propose a coarse-grained method of representing segments in videos, which is more robust and easier for LLMs to learn and follow than other alternatives. Extensive experiments show that HawkEye is better at temporal video grounding and comparable on other video-text tasks with existing video-text LLMs, which verifies its superior video-text multi-modal understanding abilities.",2024-03-15T11:58:18Z,2024-03-15T11:58:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10228v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10228v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL"
A New Dataset and A Baseline Model for Breast Lesion Detection in   Ultrasound Videos,"Zhi Lin, Junhao Lin, Lei Zhu, Huazhu Fu, Jing Qin, Liansheng Wang","Breast lesion detection in ultrasound is critical for breast cancer diagnosis. Existing methods mainly rely on individual 2D ultrasound images or combine unlabeled video and labeled 2D images to train models for breast lesion detection. In this paper, we first collect and annotate an ultrasound video dataset (188 videos) for breast lesion detection. Moreover, we propose a clip-level and video-level feature aggregated network (CVA-Net) for addressing breast lesion detection in ultrasound videos by aggregating video-level lesion classification features and clip-level temporal features. The clip-level temporal features encode local temporal information of ordered video frames and global temporal information of shuffled video frames. In our CVA-Net, an inter-video fusion module is devised to fuse local features from original video frames and global features from shuffled video frames, and an intra-video fusion module is devised to learn the temporal information among adjacent video frames. Moreover, we learn video-level features to classify the breast lesions of the original video as benign or malignant lesions to further enhance the final breast lesion detection performance in ultrasound videos. Experimental results on our annotated dataset demonstrate that our CVA-Net clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The corresponding code and dataset are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/jhl-Det/CVA-Net}.",2022-07-01T01:37:50Z,2022-07-01T01:37:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00141v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00141v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Unsupervised Adversarial Visual Level Domain Adaptation for Learning   Video Object Detectors from Images,"Avisek Lahiri, Charan Reddy, Prabir Kumar Biswas","Deep learning based object detectors require thousands of diversified bounding box and class annotated examples. Though image object detectors have shown rapid progress in recent years with the release of multiple large-scale static image datasets, object detection on videos still remains an open problem due to scarcity of annotated video frames. Having a robust video object detector is an essential component for video understanding and curating large-scale automated annotations in videos. Domain difference between images and videos makes the transferability of image object detectors to videos sub-optimal. The most common solution is to use weakly supervised annotations where a video frame has to be tagged for presence/absence of object categories. This still takes up manual effort. In this paper we take a step forward by adapting the concept of unsupervised adversarial image-to-image translation to perturb static high quality images to be visually indistinguishable from a set of video frames. We assume the presence of a fully annotated static image dataset and an unannotated video dataset. Object detector is trained on adversarially transformed image dataset using the annotations of the original dataset. Experiments on Youtube-Objects and Youtube-Objects-Subset datasets with two contemporary baseline object detectors reveal that such unsupervised pixel level domain adaptation boosts the generalization performance on video frames compared to direct application of original image object detector. Also, we achieve competitive performance compared to recent baselines of weakly supervised methods. This paper can be seen as an application of image translation for cross domain object detection.",2018-10-04T07:07:29Z,2018-10-04T07:07:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02074v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02074v1,cs.CV

Do Less and Achieve More: Training CNNs for Action Recognition Utilizing   Action Images from the Web,"Shugao Ma, Sarah Adel Bargal, Jianming Zhang, Leonid Sigal, Stan Sclaroff","Recently, attempts have been made to collect millions of videos to train CNN models for action recognition in videos. However, curating such large-scale video datasets requires immense human labor, and training CNNs on millions of videos demands huge computational resources. In contrast, collecting action images from the Web is much easier and training on images requires much less computation. In addition, labeled web images tend to contain discriminative action poses, which highlight discriminative portions of a video's temporal progression. We explore the question of whether we can utilize web action images to train better CNN models for action recognition in videos. We collect 23.8K manually filtered images from the Web that depict the 101 actions in the UCF101 action video dataset. We show that by utilizing web action images along with videos in training, significant performance boosts of CNN models can be achieved. We then investigate the scalability of the process by leveraging crawled web images (unfiltered) for UCF101 and ActivityNet.

A Graph-based Ranking Approach to Extract Key-frames for Static Video   Summarization,Saikat Chakraborty,"Video abstraction has become one of the efficient approaches to grasp the content of a video without seeing it entirely. Key frame-based static video summarization falls under this category. In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach which summarizes the video with best user satisfaction. We treated each video frame as a node of the graph and assigned a rank to each node by our proposed VidRank algorithm. We developed three different models of VidRank algorithm and performed a comparative study on those models.

Unsupervised Video-to-Video Translation,"Dina Bashkirova, Ben Usman, Kate Saenko","Unsupervised image-to-image translation is a recently proposed task of translating an image to a different style or domain given only unpaired image examples at training time. In this paper, we formulate a new task of unsupervised video-to-video translation, which poses its own unique challenges. Translating video implies learning not only the appearance of objects and scenes but also realistic motion and transitions between consecutive frames.We investigate the performance of per-frame video-to-video translation using existing image-to-image translation networks, and propose a spatio-temporal 3D translator as an alternative solution to this problem. We evaluate our 3D method on multiple synthetic datasets, such as moving colorized digits, as well as the realistic segmentation-to-video GTA dataset and a new CT-to-MRI volumetric images translation dataset. Our results show that frame-wise translation produces realistic results on a single frame level but underperforms significantly on the scale of the whole video compared to our three-dimensional translation approach, which is better able to learn the complex structure of video and motion and continuity of object appearance.",2018-06-10T18:18:26Z,2018-06-10T18:18:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03698v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03698v1,cs.CV
PG-Video-LLaVA: Pixel Grounding Large Video-Language Models,"Shehan Munasinghe, Rusiru Thushara, Muhammad Maaz, Hanoona Abdul Rasheed, Salman Khan, Mubarak Shah, Fahad Khan","Extending image-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to videos is challenging due to the inherent complexity of video data. The recent approaches extending image-based LMMs to videos either lack the grounding capabilities (e.g., VideoChat, Video-ChatGPT, Video-LLaMA) or do not utilize the audio-signals for better video understanding (e.g., Video-ChatGPT). Addressing these gaps, we propose PG-Video-LLaVA, the first LMM with pixel-level grounding capability, integrating audio cues by transcribing them into text to enrich video-context understanding. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf tracker and a novel grounding module, enabling it to spatially localize objects in videos following user instructions. We evaluate PG-Video-LLaVA using video-based generative and question-answering benchmarks and introduce new benchmarks specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance in videos. Further, we propose the use of Vicuna over GPT-3.5, as utilized in Video-ChatGPT, for video-based conversation benchmarking, ensuring reproducibility of results which is a concern with the proprietary nature of GPT-3.5.

Accuracy Improvement of Object Detection in VVC Coded Video Using   YOLO-v7 Features,"Takahiro Shindo, Taiju Watanabe, Kein Yamada, Hiroshi Watanabe","With advances in image recognition technology based on deep learning, automatic video analysis by Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widespread. As the amount of video used for image recognition increases, efficient compression methods for such video data are necessary. In general, when the image quality deteriorates due to image encoding, the image recognition accuracy also falls. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neural-network-based approach to improve image recognition accuracy, especially the object detection accuracy by applying post-processing to the encoded video. Versatile Video Coding (VVC) will be used for the video compression method, since it is the latest video coding method with the best encoding performance. The neural network is trained using the features of YOLO-v7, the latest object detection model. By using VVC as the video coding method and YOLO-v7 as the detection model, high object detection accuracy is achieved even at low bit rates. Experimental results show that the combination of the proposed method and VVC achieves better coding performance than regular VVC in object detection accuracy.",2023-04-03T02:38:54Z,2023-04-03T02:38:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00689v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.00689v1,"cs.CV, cs.MM, eess.IV"
Deceiving Google's Cloud Video Intelligence API Built for Summarizing   Videos,"Hossein Hosseini, Baicen Xiao, Radha Poovendran","Despite the rapid progress of the techniques for image classification, video annotation has remained a challenging task. Automated video annotation would be a breakthrough technology, enabling users to search within the videos. Recently, Google introduced the Cloud Video Intelligence API for video analysis. As per the website, the system can be used to ""separate signal from noise, by retrieving relevant information at the video, shot or per frame"" level. A demonstration website has been also launched, which allows anyone to select a video for annotation. The API then detects the video labels (objects within the video) as well as shot labels (description of the video events over time). In this paper, we examine the usability of the Google's Cloud Video Intelligence API in adversarial environments. In particular, we investigate whether an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that the API will return only the adversary-desired labels. For this, we select an image, which is different from the video content, and insert it, periodically and at a very low rate, into the video. We found that if we insert one image every two seconds, the API is deceived into annotating the video as if it only contained the inserted image. Note that the modification to the video is hardly noticeable as, for instance, for a typical frame rate of 25, we insert only one image per 50 video frames. We also found that, by inserting one image per second, all the shot labels returned by the API are related to the inserted image. We perform the experiments on the sample videos provided by the API demonstration website and show that our attack is successful with different videos and images.",2017-03-26T20:52:43Z,2017-03-31T05:25:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09793v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09793v2,"cs.CV, cs.LG"
A General Framework for Edited Video and Raw Video Summarization,"Xuelong Li, Bin Zhao, Xiaoqiang Lu","In this paper, we build a general summarization framework for both of edited video and raw video summarization. Overall, our work can be divided into three folds: 1) Four models are designed to capture the properties of video summaries, i.e., containing important people and objects (importance), representative to the video content (representativeness), no similar key-shots (diversity) and smoothness of the storyline (storyness). Specifically, these models are applicable to both edited videos and raw videos. 2) A comprehensive score function is built with the weighted combination of the aforementioned four models. Note that the weights of the four models in the score function, denoted as property-weight, are learned in a supervised manner. Besides, the property-weights are learned for edited videos and raw videos, respectively. 3) The training set is constructed with both edited videos and raw videos in order to make up the lack of training data. Particularly, each training video is equipped with a pair of mixing-coefficients which can reduce the structure mess in the training set caused by the rough mixture. We test our framework on three datasets, including edited videos, short raw videos and long raw videos. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",2019-04-24T07:42:23Z,2019-04-24T07:42:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10669v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10669v1,cs.CV
Motion Consistency Model: Accelerating Video Diffusion with Disentangled   Motion-Appearance Distillation,"Yuanhao Zhai, Kevin Lin, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Chung-Ching Lin, David Doermann, Junsong Yuan, Lijuan Wang","Image diffusion distillation achieves high-fidelity generation with very few sampling steps. However, applying these techniques directly to video diffusion often results in unsatisfactory frame quality due to the limited visual quality in public video datasets. This affects the performance of both teacher and student video diffusion models. Our study aims to improve video diffusion distillation while improving frame appearance using abundant high-quality image data. We propose motion consistency model (MCM), a single-stage video diffusion distillation method that disentangles motion and appearance learning. Specifically, MCM includes a video consistency model that distills motion from the video teacher model, and an image discriminator that enhances frame appearance to match high-quality image data. This combination presents two challenges: (1) conflicting frame learning objectives, as video distillation learns from low-quality video frames while the image discriminator targets high-quality images; and (2) training-inference discrepancies due to the differing quality of video samples used during training and inference. To address these challenges, we introduce disentangled motion distillation and mixed trajectory distillation. The former applies the distillation objective solely to the motion representation, while the latter mitigates training-inference discrepancies by mixing distillation trajectories from both the low- and high-quality video domains. Extensive experiments show that our MCM achieves the state-of-the-art video diffusion distillation performance. Additionally, our method can enhance frame quality in video diffusion models, producing frames with high aesthetic scores or specific styles without corresponding video data.",2024-06-11T02:09:46Z,2024-10-26T22:27:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06890v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06890v2,cs.CV
On Flow Profile Image for Video Representation,"Mohammadreza Babaee, David Full, Gerhard Rigoll","Video representation is a key challenge in many computer vision applications such as video classification, video captioning, and video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for video representation that captures meaningful information including motion and appearance from a sequence of video frames and compacts it into a single image. To this end, we compute the optical flow and use it in a least squares optimization to find a new image, the so-called Flow Profile Image (FPI). This image encodes motions as well as foreground appearance information while background information is removed. The quality of this image is validated in activity recognition experiments and the results are compared with other video representation techniques such as dynamic images [1] and eigen images [2]. The experimental results as well as visual quality confirm that FPIs can be successfully used in video processing applications.",2019-05-12T08:48:06Z,2019-05-12T08:48:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04668v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04668v1,cs.CV
Fine-gained Zero-shot Video Sampling,"Dengsheng Chen, Jie Hu, Xiaoming Wei, Enhua Wu","Incorporating a temporal dimension into pretrained image diffusion models for video generation is a prevalent approach. However, this method is computationally demanding and necessitates large-scale video datasets. More critically, the heterogeneity between image and video datasets often results in catastrophic forgetting of the image expertise. Recent attempts to directly extract video snippets from image diffusion models have somewhat mitigated these problems. Nevertheless, these methods can only generate brief video clips with simple movements and fail to capture fine-grained motion or non-grid deformation. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-Shot video Sampling algorithm, denoted as $\mathcal{ZS}^2$, capable of directly sampling high-quality video clips from existing image synthesis methods, such as Stable Diffusion, without any training or optimization. Specifically, $\mathcal{ZS}^2$ utilizes the dependency noise model and temporal momentum attention to ensure content consistency and animation coherence, respectively. This ability enables it to excel in related tasks, such as conditional and context-specialized video generation and instruction-guided video editing.

MotionVideoGAN: A Novel Video Generator Based on the Motion Space   Learned from Image Pairs,"Jingyuan Zhu, Huimin Ma, Jiansheng Chen, Jian Yuan","Video generation has achieved rapid progress benefiting from high-quality renderings provided by powerful image generators. We regard the video synthesis task as generating a sequence of images sharing the same contents but varying in motions. However, most previous video synthesis frameworks based on pre-trained image generators treat content and motion generation separately, leading to unrealistic generated videos. Therefore, we design a novel framework to build the motion space, aiming to achieve content consistency and fast convergence for video generation. We present MotionVideoGAN, a novel video generator synthesizing videos based on the motion space learned by pre-trained image pair generators. Firstly, we propose an image pair generator named MotionStyleGAN to generate image pairs sharing the same contents and producing various motions. Then we manage to acquire motion codes to edit one image in the generated image pairs and keep the other unchanged. The motion codes help us edit images within the motion space since the edited image shares the same contents with the other unchanged one in image pairs. Finally, we introduce a latent code generator to produce latent code sequences using motion codes for video generation.

Compared to video editing which faces additional challenges in the time dimension, image editing has witnessed the development of more diverse, high-quality approaches and more capable software like Photoshop. In light of this gap, we introduce a novel and generic solution that extends the applicability of image editing tools to videos by propagating edits from a single frame to the entire video using a pre-trained image-to-video model. Our method, dubbed I2VEdit, adaptively preserves the visual and motion integrity of the source video depending on the extent of the edits, effectively handling global edits, local edits, and moderate shape changes, which existing methods cannot fully achieve. At the core of our method are two main processes: Coarse Motion Extraction to align basic motion patterns with the original video, and Appearance Refinement for precise adjustments using fine-grained attention matching.

Data Collection-free Masked Video Modeling,"Yuchi Ishikawa, Masayoshi Kondo, Yoshimitsu Aoki","Pre-training video transformers generally requires a large amount of data, presenting significant challenges in terms of data collection costs and concerns related to privacy, licensing, and inherent biases. Synthesizing data is one of the promising ways to solve these issues, yet pre-training solely on synthetic data has its own challenges. In this paper, we introduce an effective self-supervised learning framework for videos that leverages readily available and less costly static images. Specifically, we define the Pseudo Motion Generator (PMG) module that recursively applies image transformations to generate pseudo-motion videos from images. These pseudo-motion videos are then leveraged in masked video modeling. Our approach is applicable to synthetic images as well, thus entirely freeing video pre-training from data collection costs and other concerns in real data. Through experiments in action recognition tasks, we demonstrate that this framework allows effective learning of spatio-temporal features through pseudo-motion videos, significantly improving over existing methods which also use static images and partially outperforming those using both real and synthetic videos.

Motivated by the availability of animation movies that are adopted from illustrated books for children, we aim to stylize these videos with the style of the original illustrations. Current state-of-the-art video-to-video translation models rely on having a video sequence or a single style image to stylize an input video. We introduce a new problem for video stylizing where an unordered set of images are used. This is a challenging task for two reasons: i) we do not have the advantage of temporal consistency as in video sequences; ii) it is more difficult to obtain consistent styles for video frames from a set of unordered images compared to using a single image.   Most of the video-to-video translation methods are built on an image-to-image translation model, and integrate additional networks such as optical flow, or temporal predictors to capture temporal relations. These additional networks make the model training and inference complicated and slow down the process. To ensure temporal coherency in video-to-video style transfer, we propose a new generator network with feature warping layers which overcomes the limitations of the previous methods.

"S3Aug: Segmentation, Sampling, and Shift for Action Recognition","Taiki Sugiura, Toru Tamaki","Action recognition is a well-established area of research in computer vision. In this paper, we propose S3Aug, a video data augmenatation for action recognition. Unlike conventional video data augmentation methods that involve cutting and pasting regions from two videos, the proposed method generates new videos from a single training video through segmentation and label-to-image transformation. Furthermore, the proposed method modifies certain categories of label images by sampling to generate a variety of videos, and shifts intermediate features to enhance the temporal coherency between frames of the generate videos. Experimental results on the UCF101, HMDB51, and Mimetics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, paricularlly for out-of-context videos of the Mimetics dataset.",2023-10-23T04:22:03Z,2023-10-23T04:22:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14556v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14556v1,cs.CV
VRT: A Video Restoration Transformer,"Jingyun Liang, Jiezhang Cao, Yuchen Fan, Kai Zhang, Rakesh Ranjan, Yawei Li, Radu Timofte, Luc Van Gool","Video restoration (e.g., video super-resolution) aims to restore high-quality frames from low-quality frames. Different from single image restoration, video restoration generally requires to utilize temporal information from multiple adjacent but usually misaligned video frames. Existing deep methods generally tackle with this by exploiting a sliding window strategy or a recurrent architecture, which either is restricted by frame-by-frame restoration or lacks long-range modelling ability. In this paper, we propose a Video Restoration Transformer (VRT) with parallel frame prediction and long-range temporal dependency modelling abilities. More specifically, VRT is composed of multiple scales, each of which consists of two kinds of modules: temporal mutual self attention (TMSA) and parallel warping. TMSA divides the video into small clips, on which mutual attention is applied for joint motion estimation, feature alignment and feature fusion, while self attention is used for feature extraction. To enable cross-clip interactions, the video sequence is shifted for every other layer. Besides, parallel warping is used to further fuse information from neighboring frames by parallel feature warping. Experimental results on five tasks, including video super-resolution, video deblurring, video denoising, video frame interpolation and space-time video super-resolution, demonstrate that VRT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins ($\textbf{up to 2.16dB}$) on fourteen benchmark datasets.",2022-01-28T17:54:43Z,2022-06-15T17:17:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12288v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12288v2,"cs.CV, eess.IV"
Shortcut-V2V: Compression Framework for Video-to-Video Translation based   on Temporal Redundancy Reduction,"Chaeyeon Chung, Yeojeong Park, Seunghwan Choi, Munkhsoyol Ganbat, Jaegul Choo","Video-to-video translation aims to generate video frames of a target domain from an input video. Despite its usefulness, the existing networks require enormous computations, necessitating their model compression for wide use. While there exist compression methods that improve computational efficiency in various image/video tasks, a generally-applicable compression method for video-to-video translation has not been studied much. In response, we present Shortcut-V2V, a general-purpose compression framework for video-to-video translation. Shourcut-V2V avoids full inference for every neighboring video frame by approximating the intermediate features of a current frame from those of the previous frame. Moreover, in our framework, a newly-proposed block called AdaBD adaptively blends and deforms features of neighboring frames, which makes more accurate predictions of the intermediate features possible. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations using well-known video-to-video translation models on various tasks to demonstrate the general applicability of our framework. The results show that Shourcut-V2V achieves comparable performance compared to the original video-to-video translation model while saving 3.2-5.7x computational cost and 7.8-44x memory at test time.",2023-08-15T19:50:38Z,2023-10-03T22:12:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08011v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08011v2,cs.CV
VideoGen: A Reference-Guided Latent Diffusion Approach for High   Definition Text-to-Video Generation,"Xin Li, Wenqing Chu, Ye Wu, Weihang Yuan, Fanglong Liu, Qi Zhang, Fu Li, Haocheng Feng, Errui Ding, Jingdong Wang","In this paper, we present VideoGen, a text-to-video generation approach, which can generate a high-definition video with high frame fidelity and strong temporal consistency using reference-guided latent diffusion. We leverage an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model, e.g., Stable Diffusion, to generate an image with high content quality from the text prompt, as a reference image to guide video generation. Then, we introduce an efficient cascaded latent diffusion module conditioned on both the reference image and the text prompt, for generating latent video representations, followed by a flow-based temporal upsampling step to improve the temporal resolution. Finally, we map latent video representations into a high-definition video through an enhanced video decoder. During training, we use the first frame of a ground-truth video as the reference image for training the cascaded latent diffusion module. The main characterises of our approach include: the reference image generated by the text-to-image model improves the visual fidelity; using it as the condition makes the diffusion model focus more on learning the video dynamics; and the video decoder is trained over unlabeled video data, thus benefiting from high-quality easily-available videos.

PRNU-Based Source Device Attribution for YouTube Videos,"Emmanuel Kiegaing Kouokam, Ahmet Emir Dirik","Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) is a camera imaging sensor imperfection which has earned a great interest for source device attribution of digital videos. A majority of recent researches about PRNU-based source device attribution for digital videos do not take into consideration the effects of video compression on the PRNU noise in video frames, but rather consider video frames as isolated images of equal importance. As a result, these methods perform poorly on re-compressed or low bit-rate videos. This paper proposes a novel method for PRNU fingerprint estimation from video frames taking into account the effects of video compression on the PRNU noise in these frames. With this method, we aim to determine whether two videos from unknown sources originate from the same device or not. Experimental results on a large set of videos show that the method we propose is more effective than existing frame-based methods that use either only I frames or all (I-B-P) frames, especially on YouTube videos.",2019-03-21T17:52:22Z,2019-04-01T15:51:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09141v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09141v2,"eess.IV, eess.SP"
Video-to-Video Translation for Visual Speech Synthesis,"Michail C.

We study the task of video-to-video translation in the context of visual speech generation, where the goal is to transform an input video of any spoken word to an output video of a different word. This is a multi-domain translation, where each word forms a domain of videos uttering this word. Adaptation of the state-of-the-art image-to-image translation model (StarGAN) to this setting falls short with a large vocabulary size. Instead we propose to use character encodings of the words and design a novel character-based GANs architecture for video-to-video translation called Visual Speech GAN (ViSpGAN).

Temporal Knowledge Propagation for Image-to-Video Person   Re-identification,"Xinqian Gu, Bingpeng Ma, Hong Chang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen","In many scenarios of Person Re-identification (Re-ID), the gallery set consists of lots of surveillance videos and the query is just an image, thus Re-ID has to be conducted between image and videos. Compared with videos, still person images lack temporal information. Besides, the information asymmetry between image and video features increases the difficulty in matching images and videos. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Temporal Knowledge Propagation (TKP) method which propagates the temporal knowledge learned by the video representation network to the image representation network. Specifically, given the input videos, we enforce the image representation network to fit the outputs of video representation network in a shared feature space. With back propagation, temporal knowledge can be transferred to enhance the image features and the information asymmetry problem can be alleviated. With additional classification and integrated triplet losses, our model can learn expressive and discriminative image and video features for image-to-video re-identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the overall results on two widely used datasets surpass the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Temporal As a Plugin: Unsupervised Video Denoising with Pre-Trained   Image Denoisers,"Zixuan Fu, Lanqing Guo, Chong Wang, Yufei Wang, Zhihao Li, Bihan Wen","Recent advancements in deep learning have shown impressive results in image and video denoising, leveraging extensive pairs of noisy and noise-free data for supervision. However, the challenge of acquiring paired videos for dynamic scenes hampers the practical deployment of deep video denoising techniques. In contrast, this obstacle is less pronounced in image denoising, where paired data is more readily available. Thus, a well-trained image denoiser could serve as a reliable spatial prior for video denoising. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised video denoising framework, named ``Temporal As a Plugin'' (TAP), which integrates tunable temporal modules into a pre-trained image denoiser. By incorporating temporal modules, our method can harness temporal information across noisy frames, complementing its power of spatial denoising. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive fine-tuning strategy that refines each temporal module using the generated pseudo clean video frames, progressively enhancing the network's denoising performance.

VCISR: Blind Single Image Super-Resolution with Video Compression   Synthetic Data,"Boyang Wang, Bowen Liu, Shiyu Liu, Fengyu Yang","In the blind single image super-resolution (SISR) task, existing works have been successful in restoring image-level unknown degradations. However, when a single video frame becomes the input, these works usually fail to address degradations caused by video compression, such as mosquito noise, ringing, blockiness, and staircase noise. In this work, we for the first time, present a video compression-based degradation model to synthesize low-resolution image data in the blind SISR task. Our proposed image synthesizing method is widely applicable to existing image datasets, so that a single degraded image can contain distortions caused by the lossy video compression algorithms. This overcomes the leak of feature diversity in video data and thus retains the training efficiency. By introducing video coding artifacts to SISR degradation models, neural networks can super-resolve images with the ability to restore video compression degradations, and achieve better results on restoring generic distortions caused by image compression as well. Our proposed approach achieves superior performance in SOTA no-reference Image Quality Assessment, and shows better visual quality on various datasets. In addition, we evaluate the SISR neural network trained with our degradation model on video super-resolution (VSR) datasets. Compared to architectures specifically designed for the VSR purpose, our method exhibits similar or better performance, evidencing that the presented strategy on infusing video-based degradation is generalizable to address more complicated compression artifacts even without temporal cues.",2023-11-02T05:24:19Z,2023-11-23T03:58:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00996v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00996v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

Video generation from a single face image is an interesting problem and usually tackled by utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to integrate information from the input face image and a sequence of sparse facial landmarks. However, the generated face images usually suffer from quality loss, image distortion, identity change, and expression mismatching due to the weak representation capacity of the facial landmarks. In this paper, we propose to ""imagine"" a face video from a single face image according to the reconstructed 3D face dynamics, aiming to generate a realistic and identity-preserving face video, with precisely predicted pose and facial expression. The 3D dynamics reveal changes of the facial expression and motion, and can serve as a strong prior knowledge for guiding highly realistic face video generation. In particular, we explore face video prediction and exploit a well-designed 3D dynamic prediction network to predict a 3D dynamic sequence for a single face image. The 3D dynamics are then further rendered by the sparse texture mapping algorithm to recover structural details and sparse textures for generating face frames.

Contrastive Learning of Image Representations with Cross-Video   Cycle-Consistency,"Haiping Wu, Xiaolong Wang","Recent works have advanced the performance of self-supervised representation learning by a large margin. The core among these methods is intra-image invariance learning. Two different transformations of one image instance are considered as a positive sample pair, where various tasks are designed to learn invariant representations by comparing the pair. Analogically, for video data, representations of frames from the same video are trained to be closer than frames from other videos, i.e. intra-video invariance. However, cross-video relation has barely been explored for visual representation learning. Unlike intra-video invariance, ground-truth labels of cross-video relation is usually unavailable without human labors. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning method which explores the cross-video relation by using cycle-consistency for general image representation learning. This allows to collect positive sample pairs across different video instances, which we hypothesize will lead to higher-level semantics. We validate our method by transferring our image representation to multiple downstream tasks including visual object tracking, image classification, and action recognition.

Lightweight Hybrid Video Compression Framework Using Reference-Guided   Restoration Network,"Hochang Rhee, Seyun Kim, Nam Ik Cho","Recent deep-learning-based video compression methods brought coding gains over conventional codecs such as AVC and HEVC. However, learning-based codecs generally require considerable computation time and model complexity. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight hybrid video codec consisting of a conventional video codec(HEVC / VVC), a lossless image codec, and our new restoration network. Precisely, our encoder consists of the conventional video encoder and a lossless image encoder, transmitting a lossy-compressed video bitstream along with a losslessly-compressed reference frame. The decoder is constructed with corresponding video/image decoders and a new restoration network, which enhances the compressed video in two-step processes. In the first step, a network trained with a large video dataset restores the details lost by the conventional encoder. Then, we further boost the video quality with the guidance of a reference image, which is a losslessly compressed video frame. The reference image provides video-specific information, which can be utilized to better restore the details of a compressed video. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to top-tier methods, even when applied to HEVC. Nevertheless, our method has lower complexity, a faster run time, and can be easily integrated into existing conventional codecs.",2023-03-21T04:42:44Z,2023-03-21T04:42:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11592v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11592v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

In this work, we propose a novel approach to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos by merging self-attention tokens across frames. By aligning and compressing temporally redundant tokens across frames, our method improves temporal coherence and reduces memory consumption in self-attention computations. The merging strategy matches and aligns tokens according to the temporal correspondence between frames, facilitating natural temporal consistency in generated video frames. To manage the complexity of video processing, we divide videos into chunks and develop intra-chunk local token merging and inter-chunk global token merging, ensuring both short-term video continuity and long-term content consistency.

To address these issues, we propose an Image-video-joint polyp detection network (Ivy-Net) to address the domain gap between colonoscopy images from historical medical reports and real-time videos. In our Ivy-Net, a modified mixup is utilized to generate training data by combining the positive images and negative video frames at the pixel level, which could learn the domain adaptive representations and augment the positive samples. Simultaneously, a temporal coherence regularization (TCR) is proposed to introduce the smooth constraint on feature-level in adjacent frames and improve polyp detection by unlabeled colonoscopy videos. For evaluation, a new large colonoscopy polyp dataset is collected, which contains 3056 images from historical medical reports of 889 positive patients and 7.5-hour videos of 69 patients (28 positive).

Baddar, Geonmo Gu, Sangmin Lee, Yong Man Ro","In this paper, we propose Dynamics Transfer GAN; a new method for generating video sequences based on generative adversarial learning. The spatial constructs of a generated video sequence are acquired from the target image. The dynamics of the generated video sequence are imported from a source video sequence, with arbitrary motion, and imposed onto the target image. To preserve the spatial construct of the target image, the appearance of the source video sequence is suppressed and only the dynamics are obtained before being imposed onto the target image. That is achieved using the proposed appearance suppressed dynamics feature. Moreover, the spatial and temporal consistencies of the generated video sequence are verified via two discriminator networks. One discriminator validates the fidelity of the generated frames appearance, while the other validates the dynamic consistency of the generated video sequence. Experiments have been conducted to verify the quality of the video sequences generated by the proposed method. The results verified that Dynamics Transfer GAN successfully transferred arbitrary dynamics of the source video sequence onto a target image when generating the output video sequence. The experimental results also showed that Dynamics Transfer GAN maintained the spatial constructs (appearance) of the target image while generating spatially and temporally consistent video sequences.",2017-12-10T14:18:26Z,2017-12-10T14:18:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03534v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03534v1,cs.CV
Video Reconstruction from a Single Motion Blurred Image using Learned   Dynamic Phase Coding,"Erez Yosef, Shay Elmalem, Raja Giryes","Video reconstruction from a single motion-blurred image is a challenging problem, which can enhance the capabilities of existing cameras. Recently, several works addressed this task using conventional imaging and deep learning. Yet, such purely-digital methods are inherently limited, due to direction ambiguity and noise sensitivity. Some works proposed to address these limitations using non-conventional image sensors, however, such sensors are extremely rare and expensive. To circumvent these limitations with simpler means, we propose a hybrid optical-digital method for video reconstruction that requires only simple modifications to existing optical systems. We use a learned dynamic phase-coding in the lens aperture during the image acquisition to encode the motion trajectories, which serve as prior information for the video reconstruction process. The proposed computational camera generates a sharp frame burst of the scene at various frame rates from a single coded motion-blurred image, using an image-to-video convolutional neural network. We present advantages and improved performance compared to existing methods, using both simulations and a real-world camera prototype. We extend our optical coding also to video frame interpolation and present robust and improved results for noisy videos.",2021-12-28T02:06:44Z,2022-12-18T11:13:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14768v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14768v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Diversity-aware Multi-Video Summarization,"Rameswar Panda, Niluthpol Chowdhury Mithun, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury","Most video summarization approaches have focused on extracting a summary from a single video; we propose an unsupervised framework for summarizing a collection of videos. We observe that each video in the collection may contain some information that other videos do not have, and thus exploring the underlying complementarity could be beneficial in creating a diverse informative summary. We develop a novel diversity-aware sparse optimization method for multi-video summarization by exploring the complementarity within the videos. Our approach extracts a multi-video summary which is both interesting and representative in describing the whole video collection. To efficiently solve our optimization problem, we develop an alternating minimization algorithm that minimizes the overall objective function with respect to one video at a time while fixing the other videos. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, Tour20, that contains 140 videos with multiple human created summaries, which were acquired in a controlled experiment. Finally, by extensive experiments on the new Tour20 dataset and several other multi-view datasets, we show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the two problems-topic-oriented video summarization and multi-view video summarization in a camera network.",2017-06-09T20:58:07Z,2017-06-09T20:58:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03123v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03123v1,cs.CV
Reenact Anything: Semantic Video Motion Transfer Using Motion-Textual   Inversion,"Manuel Kansy, Jacek Naruniec, Christopher Schroers, Markus Gross, Romann M. Weber","Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.",2024-08-01T10:55:20Z,2024-08-01T10:55:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00458v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00458v1,"cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG, I.3.3; I.4"
TIP-I2V: A Million-Scale Real Text and Image Prompt Dataset for   Image-to-Video Generation,"Wenhao Wang, Yi Yang","Video generation models are revolutionizing content creation, with image-to-video models drawing increasing attention due to their enhanced controllability, visual consistency, and practical applications. However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset.

VDPVE: VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement,"Yixuan Gao, Yuqin Cao, Tengchuan Kou, Wei Sun, Yunlong Dong, Xiaohong Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai","Recently, many video enhancement methods have been proposed to improve video quality from different aspects such as color, brightness, contrast, and stability. Therefore, how to evaluate the quality of the enhanced video in a way consistent with human visual perception is an important research topic. However, most video quality assessment methods mainly calculate video quality by estimating the distortion degrees of videos from an overall perspective. Few researchers have specifically proposed a video quality assessment method for video enhancement, and there is also no comprehensive video quality assessment dataset available in public. Therefore, we construct a Video quality assessment dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement (VDPVE) in this paper. The VDPVE has 1211 videos with different enhancements, which can be divided into three sub-datasets: the first sub-dataset has 600 videos with color, brightness, and contrast enhancements; the second sub-dataset has 310 videos with deblurring; and the third sub-dataset has 301 deshaked videos. We invited 21 subjects (20 valid subjects) to rate all enhanced videos in the VDPVE. After normalizing and averaging the subjective opinion scores, the mean opinion score of each video can be obtained. Furthermore, we split the VDPVE into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, and verify the performance of several state-of-the-art video quality assessment methods on the test set of the VDPVE.",2023-03-16T13:11:16Z,2023-03-16T13:11:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09290v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09290v1,eess.IV

ZeroI2V: Zero-Cost Adaptation of Pre-trained Transformers from Image to   Video,"Xinhao Li, Yuhan Zhu, Limin Wang","Adapting image models to the video domain has emerged as an efficient paradigm for solving video recognition tasks. Due to the huge number of parameters and effective transferability of image models, performing full fine-tuning is less efficient and even unnecessary. Thus, recent research is shifting its focus toward parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation. However, these adaptation strategies inevitably introduce extra computational costs to deal with the domain gap and temporal modeling in videos. In this paper, we present a new adaptation paradigm (ZeroI2V) to transfer the image transformers to video recognition tasks (i.e., introduce zero extra cost to the original models during inference). To achieve this goal, we present two core designs. First, to capture the dynamics in videos and reduce the difficulty of image-to-video adaptation, we exploit the flexibility of self-attention and introduce spatial-temporal dual-headed attention (STDHA). This approach efficiently endows the image transformers with temporal modeling capability at zero extra parameters and computation. Second, to handle the domain gap between images and videos, we propose a linear adaption strategy that utilizes lightweight densely placed linear adapters to fully transfer the frozen image models to video recognition. Thanks to the customized linear design, all newly added adapters could be easily merged with the original modules through structural reparameterization after training, enabling zero extra cost during inference. Extensive experiments on representative fully-supervised and few-shot video recognition benchmarks showcase that ZeroI2V can match or even outperform previous state-of-the-art methods while enjoying superior parameter and inference efficiency.",2023-10-02T16:41:20Z,2024-07-11T14:53:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01324v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01324v2,cs.CV
Adaptive Super Resolution For One-Shot Talking-Head Generation,"Luchuan Song, Pinxin Liu, Guojun Yin, Chenliang Xu","The one-shot talking-head generation learns to synthesize a talking-head video with one source portrait image under the driving of same or different identity video. Usually these methods require plane-based pixel transformations via Jacobin matrices or facial image warps for novel poses generation. The constraints of using a single image source and pixel displacements often compromise the clarity of the synthesized images. Some methods try to improve the quality of synthesized videos by introducing additional super-resolution modules, but this will undoubtedly increase computational consumption and destroy the original data distribution. In this work, we propose an adaptive high-quality talking-head video generation method, which synthesizes high-resolution video without additional pre-trained modules. Specifically, inspired by existing super-resolution methods, we down-sample the one-shot source image, and then adaptively reconstruct high-frequency details via an encoder-decoder module, resulting in enhanced video clarity. Our method consistently improves the quality of generated videos through a straightforward yet effective strategy, substantiated by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Snapshot HDR Video Construction Using Coded Mask,"Masheal Alghamdi, Qiang Fu, Ali Thabet, Wolfgang Heidrich","This paper study the reconstruction of High Dynamic Range (HDR) video from snapshot-coded LDR video. Constructing an HDR video requires restoring the HDR values for each frame and maintaining the consistency between successive frames. HDR image acquisition from single image capture, also known as snapshot HDR imaging, can be achieved in several ways. For example, the reconfigurable snapshot HDR camera is realized by introducing an optical element into the optical stack of the camera; by placing a coded mask at a small standoff distance in front of the sensor. High-quality HDR image can be recovered from the captured coded image using deep learning methods. This study utilizes 3D-CNNs to perform a joint demosaicking, denoising, and HDR video reconstruction from coded LDR video. We enforce more temporally consistent HDR video reconstruction by introducing a temporal loss function that considers the short-term and long-term consistency. The obtained results are promising and could lead to affordable HDR video capture using conventional cameras.",2021-12-05T09:32:11Z,2021-12-05T09:32:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02522v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02522v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
NeRV: Neural Representations for Videos,"Hao Chen, Bo He, Hanyu Wang, Yixuan Ren, Ser-Nam Lim, Abhinav Shrivastava","We propose a novel neural representation for videos (NeRV) which encodes videos in neural networks. Unlike conventional representations that treat videos as frame sequences, we represent videos as neural networks taking frame index as input. Given a frame index, NeRV outputs the corresponding RGB image. Video encoding in NeRV is simply fitting a neural network to video frames and decoding process is a simple feedforward operation. As an image-wise implicit representation, NeRV output the whole image and shows great efficiency compared to pixel-wise implicit representation, improving the encoding speed by 25x to 70x, the decoding speed by 38x to 132x, while achieving better video quality. With such a representation, we can treat videos as neural networks, simplifying several video-related tasks. For example, conventional video compression methods are restricted by a long and complex pipeline, specifically designed for the task. In contrast, with NeRV, we can use any neural network compression method as a proxy for video compression, and achieve comparable performance to traditional frame-based video compression approaches (H.264, HEVC \etc). Besides compression, we demonstrate the generalization of NeRV for video denoising.

This survey analyzes over 200 video foundational models, offering a comprehensive overview of benchmarks and evaluation metrics across 14 distinct video tasks categorized into 3 main categories. Additionally, we offer an in-depth performance analysis of these models for the 6 most common video tasks. We categorize ViFMs into three categories: 1) Image-based ViFMs, which adapt existing image models for video tasks, 2) Video-Based ViFMs, which utilize video-specific encoding methods, and 3) Universal Foundational Models (UFMs), which combine multiple modalities (image, video, audio, and text etc.) within a single framework. By comparing the performance of various ViFMs on different tasks, this survey offers valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses, guiding future advancements in video understanding.

ItoV: Efficiently Adapting Deep Learning-based Image Watermarking to   Video Watermarking,"Guanhui Ye, Jiashi Gao, Yuchen Wang, Liyan Song, Xuetao Wei","Robust watermarking tries to conceal information within a cover image/video imperceptibly that is resistant to various distortions. Recently, deep learning-based approaches for image watermarking have made significant advancements in robustness and invisibility. However, few studies focused on video watermarking using deep neural networks due to the high complexity and computational costs. Our paper aims to answer this research question: Can well-designed deep learning-based image watermarking be efficiently adapted to video watermarking? Our answer is positive. First, we revisit the workflow of deep learning-based watermarking methods that leads to a critical insight: temporal information in the video may be essential for general computer vision tasks but not for specific video watermarking. Inspired by this insight, we propose a method named ItoV for efficiently adapting deep learning-based Image watermarking to Video watermarking. Specifically, ItoV merges the temporal dimension of the video with the channel dimension to enable deep neural networks to treat videos as images. We further explore the effects of different convolutional blocks in video watermarking. We find that spatial convolution is the primary influential component in video watermarking and depthwise convolutions significantly reduce computational cost with negligible impact on performance. In addition, we propose a new frame loss to constrain that the watermark intensity in each video clip frame is consistent, significantly improving the invisibility. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of the adapted video watermarking method compared with the state-of-the-art methods on Kinetics-600 and Inter4K datasets, which demonstrate the efficacy of our method ItoV.",2023-05-04T12:26:24Z,2023-05-04T12:26:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02781v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02781v1,cs.CR
Learning text-to-video retrieval from image captioning,"Lucas Ventura, Cordelia Schmid, Gül Varol","We describe a protocol to study text-to-video retrieval training with unlabeled videos, where we assume (i) no access to labels for any videos, i.e., no access to the set of ground-truth captions, but (ii) access to labeled images in the form of text. Using image expert models is a realistic scenario given that annotating images is cheaper therefore scalable, in contrast to expensive video labeling schemes. Recently, zero-shot image experts such as CLIP have established a new strong baseline for video understanding tasks. In this paper, we make use of this progress and instantiate the image experts from two types of models: a text-to-image retrieval model to provide an initial backbone, and image captioning models to provide supervision signal into unlabeled videos. We show that automatically labeling video frames with image captioning allows text-to-video retrieval training. This process adapts the features to the target domain at no manual annotation cost, consequently outperforming the strong zero-shot CLIP baseline. During training, we sample captions from multiple video frames that best match the visual content, and perform a temporal pooling over frame representations by scoring frames according to their relevance to each caption. We conduct extensive ablations to provide insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of this simple framework by outperforming the CLIP zero-shot baselines on text-to-video retrieval on three standard datasets, namely ActivityNet, MSR-VTT, and MSVD.",2024-04-26T15:56:08Z,2024-04-26T15:56:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17498v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17498v1,cs.CV

Discrete Wavelet Transform and Gradient Difference based approach for   text localization in videos,"B. H. Shekar, Smitha M. L., P.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid method to robustly localize the texts in natural scene images and videos based on fusion of discrete wavelet transform and gradient difference. A set of rules and geometric properties have been devised to localize the actual text regions. Then, morphological operation is performed to generate the text regions and finally the connected component analysis is employed to localize the text in a video frame.

Continuous Video Process: Modeling Videos as Continuous   Multi-Dimensional Processes for Video Prediction,"Gaurav Shrivastava, Abhinav Shrivastava","Diffusion models have made significant strides in image generation, mastering tasks such as unconditional image synthesis, text-image translation, and image-to-image conversions. However, their capability falls short in the realm of video prediction, mainly because they treat videos as a collection of independent images, relying on external constraints such as temporal attention mechanisms to enforce temporal coherence. In our paper, we introduce a novel model class, that treats video as a continuous multi-dimensional process rather than a series of discrete frames. We also report a reduction of 75\% sampling steps required to sample a new frame thus making our framework more efficient during the inference time.

Efficient in-situ image and video compression through probabilistic   image representation,"Rongjie Liu, Meng Li, Li Ma","Fast and effective image compression for multi-dimensional images has become increasingly important for efficient storage and transfer of massive amounts of high-resolution images and videos. Desirable properties in compression methods include (1) high reconstruction quality at a wide range of compression rates while preserving key local details, (2) computational scalability, (3) applicability to a variety of different image/video types and of different dimensions, (4) progressive transmission, and (5) ease of tuning. We present such a method for multi-dimensional image compression called Compression via Adaptive Recursive Partitioning (CARP). CARP uses an optimal permutation of the image pixels inferred from a Bayesian probabilistic model on recursive partitions of the image to reduce its effective dimensionality, achieving a parsimonious representation that preserves information. CARP uses a multi-layer Bayesian hierarchical model to achieve in-situ compression along with self-tuning and regularization, with just one single parameter to be specified by the user to achieve the desired compression rate. Extensive numerical experiments using a variety of datasets including 2D still images, real-life YouTube videos, and surveillance videos show that CARP dominates the state-of-the-art image/video compression approaches---including JPEG, JPEG2000, BPG, MPEG4, HEVC and a neural network-based method---for all of these different image types and on nearly all of the individual images and videos over some methods.",2019-12-11T21:00:08Z,2020-11-12T00:54:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05622v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05622v3,"eess.IV, stat.AP"
Convolutional Video Steganography with Temporal Residual Modeling,"Xinyu Weng, Yongzhi Li, Lu Chi, Yadong Mu","Steganography represents the art of unobtrusively concealing a secrete message within some cover data. The key scope of this work is about visual steganography techniques that hide a full-sized color image / video within another. A majority of existing works are devoted to the image case, where both secret and cover data are images. We empirically validate that image steganography model does not naturally extend to the video case (i.e., hiding a video into another video), mainly because it completely ignores the temporal redundancy within consecutive video frames. Our work proposes a novel solution to the problem of video steganography. The technical contributions are two-fold: first, the residual between two consecutive frames tends to zero at most pixels. Hiding such highly-sparse data is significantly easier than hiding the original frames. Motivated by this fact, we propose to explicitly consider inter-frame residuals rather than blindly applying image steganography model on every video frame. Specifically, our model contains two branches, one of which is specially designed for hiding inter-frame difference into a cover video frame and the other instead hides the original secret frame. A simple thresholding method determines which branch a secret video frame shall choose. When revealing the concealed secret video, two decoders are devised, revealing difference or frame respectively. Second, we develop the model based on deep convolutional neural networks, which is the first of its kind in the literature of video steganography. In experiments, comprehensive evaluations are conducted to compare our model with both classic least significant bit (LSB) method and pure image steganography models. All results strongly suggest that the proposed model enjoys advantages over previous methods. We also carefully investigate key factors in the success of our deep video steganography model.",2018-06-08T01:52:36Z,2018-06-08T01:52:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02941v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02941v1,cs.MM
DiffSynth: Latent In-Iteration Deflickering for Realistic Video   Synthesis,"Zhongjie Duan, Lizhou You, Chengyu Wang, Cen Chen, Ziheng Wu, Weining Qian, Jun Huang","In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as the most powerful approach in image synthesis. However, applying these models directly to video synthesis presents challenges, as it often leads to noticeable flickering contents. Although recently proposed zero-shot methods can alleviate flicker to some extent, we still struggle to generate coherent videos. In this paper, we propose DiffSynth, a novel approach that aims to convert image synthesis pipelines to video synthesis pipelines. DiffSynth consists of two key components: a latent in-iteration deflickering framework and a video deflickering algorithm. The latent in-iteration deflickering framework applies video deflickering to the latent space of diffusion models, effectively preventing flicker accumulation in intermediate steps. Additionally, we propose a video deflickering algorithm, named patch blending algorithm, that remaps objects in different frames and blends them together to enhance video consistency. One of the notable advantages of DiffSynth is its general applicability to various video synthesis tasks, including text-guided video stylization, fashion video synthesis, image-guided video stylization, video restoring, and 3D rendering. In the task of text-guided video stylization, we make it possible to synthesize high-quality videos without cherry-picking. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffSynth.

This growing interest has prompted us to explore extending this unification to videos. The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs, and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work, we introduce Divot, a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer, which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition, then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally, the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer, decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer, we present Divot-Vicuna through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer, when integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks. The instruction tuned Divot-Vicuna also excels in video storytelling, generating interleaved narratives and corresponding videos.",2024-12-05T18:53:04Z,2024-12-05T18:53:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04432v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04432v1,cs.CV
Replace Anyone in Videos,"Xiang Wang, Changxin Gao, Yuehuan Wang, Nong Sang","Recent advancements in controllable human-centric video generation, particularly with the rise of diffusion models, have demonstrated considerable progress. However, achieving precise and localized control over human motion, e.g., replacing or inserting individuals into videos while exhibiting desired motion patterns, still remains challenging. In this work, we propose the ReplaceAnyone framework, which focuses on localizing and manipulating human motion in videos with diverse and intricate backgrounds. Specifically, we formulate this task as an image-conditioned pose-driven video inpainting paradigm, employing a unified video diffusion architecture that facilitates image-conditioned pose-driven video generation and inpainting within masked video regions. Moreover, we introduce diverse mask forms involving regular and irregular shapes to avoid shape leakage and allow granular local control. Additionally, we implement a two-stage training methodology, initially training an image-conditioned pose driven video generation model, followed by joint training of the video inpainting within masked areas. In this way, our approach enables seamless replacement or insertion of characters while maintaining the desired pose motion and reference appearance within a single framework. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and coherent video content.",2024-09-30T03:27:33Z,2024-09-30T03:27:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19911v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19911v1,cs.CV
CoDeF: Content Deformation Fields for Temporally Consistent Video   Processing,"Hao Ouyang, Qiuyu Wang, Yuxi Xiao, Qingyan Bai, Juntao Zhang, Kecheng Zheng, Xiaowei Zhou, Qifeng Chen, Yujun Shen","We present the content deformation field CoDeF as a new type of video representation, which consists of a canonical content field aggregating the static contents in the entire video and a temporal deformation field recording the transformations from the canonical image (i.e., rendered from the canonical content field) to each individual frame along the time axis. Given a target video, these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a carefully tailored rendering pipeline. We advisedly introduce some regularizations into the optimization process, urging the canonical content field to inherit semantics (e.g., the object shape) from the video. With such a design, CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing, in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the temporal deformation field. We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without any training. More importantly, thanks to our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image, we achieve superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing video-to-video translation approaches, and even manage to track non-rigid objects like water and smog.

Deep Image-to-Video Adaptation and Fusion Networks for Action   Recognition,"Yang Liu, Zhaoyang Lu, Jing Li, Tao Yang, Chao Yao","Existing deep learning methods for action recognition in videos require a large number of labeled videos for training, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. For the same action, the knowledge learned from different media types, e.g., videos and images, may be related and complementary. However, due to the domain shifts and heterogeneous feature representations between videos and images, the performance of classifiers trained on images may be dramatically degraded when directly deployed to videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Deep Image-to-Video Adaptation and Fusion Networks (DIVAFN), to enhance action recognition in videos by transferring knowledge from images using video keyframes as a bridge. The DIVAFN is a unified deep learning model, which integrates domain-invariant representations learning and cross-modal feature fusion into a unified optimization framework. Specifically, we design an efficient cross-modal similarities metric to reduce the modality shift among images, keyframes and videos. Then, we adopt an autoencoder architecture, whose hidden layer is constrained to be the semantic representations of the action class names. In this way, when the autoencoder is adopted to project the learned features from different domains to the same space, more compact, informative and discriminative representations can be obtained. Finally, the concatenation of the learned semantic feature representations from these three autoencoders are used to train the classifier for action recognition in videos. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art domain adaptation and action recognition methods.",2019-11-25T08:02:17Z,2019-11-25T08:02:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10751v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10751v1,cs.CV
PVC: Progressive Visual Token Compression for Unified Image and Video   Processing in Large Vision-Language Models,"Chenyu Yang, Xuan Dong, Xizhou Zhu, Weijie Su, Jiahao Wang, Hao Tian, Zhe Chen, Wenhai Wang, Lewei Lu, Jifeng Dai","Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been extended to understand both images and videos. Visual token compression is leveraged to reduce the considerable token length of visual inputs. To meet the needs of different tasks, existing high-performance models usually process images and videos separately with different token compression strategies, limiting the capabilities of combining images and videos. To this end, we extend each image into a ""static"" video and introduce a unified token compression strategy called Progressive Visual Token Compression (PVC), where the tokens of each frame are progressively encoded and adaptively compressed to supplement the information not extracted from previous frames. Video tokens are efficiently compressed with exploiting the inherent temporal redundancy. Images are repeated as static videos, and the spatial details can be gradually supplemented in multiple frames. PVC unifies the token compressing of images and videos. With a limited number of tokens per frame (64 tokens by default), spatial details and temporal changes can still be preserved. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks, including long video tasks and fine-grained short video tasks. Meanwhile, our unified token compression strategy incurs no performance loss on image benchmarks, particularly in detail-sensitive tasks.",2024-12-12T18:59:40Z,2024-12-12T18:59:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09613v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09613v1,cs.CV

Rerender A Video: Zero-Shot Text-Guided Video-to-Video Translation,"Shuai Yang, Yifan Zhou, Ziwei Liu, Chen Change Loy","Large text-to-image diffusion models have exhibited impressive proficiency in generating high-quality images. However, when applying these models to video domain, ensuring temporal consistency across video frames remains a formidable challenge. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot text-guided video-to-video translation framework to adapt image models to videos. The framework includes two parts: key frame translation and full video translation. The first part uses an adapted diffusion model to generate key frames, with hierarchical cross-frame constraints applied to enforce coherence in shapes, textures and colors. The second part propagates the key frames to other frames with temporal-aware patch matching and frame blending. Our framework achieves global style and local texture temporal consistency at a low cost (without re-training or optimization). The adaptation is compatible with existing image diffusion techniques, allowing our framework to take advantage of them, such as customizing a specific subject with LoRA, and introducing extra spatial guidance with ControlNet. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework over existing methods in rendering high-quality and temporally-coherent videos.",2023-06-13T17:52:23Z,2023-09-17T09:57:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07954v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07954v2,cs.CV
Exploiting Motion Information from Unlabeled Videos for Static Image   Action Recognition,"Yiyi Zhang, Li Niu, Ziqi Pan, Meichao Luo, Jianfu Zhang, Dawei Cheng, Liqing Zhang","Static image action recognition, which aims to recognize action based on a single image, usually relies on expensive human labeling effort such as adequate labeled action images and large-scale labeled image dataset. In contrast, abundant unlabeled videos can be economically obtained. Therefore, several works have explored using unlabeled videos to facilitate image action recognition, which can be categorized into the following two groups: (a) enhance visual representations of action images with a designed proxy task on unlabeled videos, which falls into the scope of self-supervised learning; (b) generate auxiliary representations for action images with the generator learned from unlabeled videos. In this paper, we integrate the above two strategies in a unified framework, which consists of Visual Representation Enhancement (VRE) module and Motion Representation Augmentation (MRA) module. Specifically, the VRE module includes a proxy task which imposes pseudo motion label constraint and temporal coherence constraint on unlabeled videos, while the MRA module could predict the motion information of a static action image by exploiting unlabeled videos.

LaMD: Latent Motion Diffusion for Video Generation,"Yaosi Hu, Zhenzhong Chen, Chong Luo","Generating coherent and natural movement is the key challenge in video generation. This research proposes to condense video generation into a problem of motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video generation more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video generation process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. We present a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a motion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to implement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video autoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion representation. Meanwhile, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to efficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under multi-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion models. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos with a wide range of motions, from stochastic dynamics to highly controllable movements. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, including BAIR, Landscape and CATER-GENs, for Image-to-Video (I2V) and Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) generation.

DistInit: Learning Video Representations Without a Single Labeled Video,"Rohit Girdhar, Du Tran, Lorenzo Torresani, Deva Ramanan","Video recognition models have progressed significantly over the past few years, evolving from shallow classifiers trained on hand-crafted features to deep spatiotemporal networks. However, labeled video data required to train such models have not been able to keep up with the ever-increasing depth and sophistication of these networks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to learning video representations that require no semantically labeled videos and instead leverages the years of effort in collecting and labeling large and clean still-image datasets. We do so by using state-of-the-art models pre-trained on image datasets as ""teachers"" to train video models in a distillation framework. We demonstrate that our method learns truly spatiotemporal features, despite being trained only using supervision from still-image networks. Moreover, it learns good representations across different input modalities, using completely uncurated raw video data sources and with different 2D teacher models. Our method obtains strong transfer performance, outperforming standard techniques for bootstrapping video architectures with image-based models by 16%.

However, these impressive image processing approaches face consistency issues in video processing. In this paper, we propose a powerful model-free toolkit called FastBlend to address the consistency problem for video processing. Based on a patch matching algorithm, we design two inference modes, including blending and interpolation. In the blending mode, FastBlend eliminates video flicker by blending the frames within a sliding window. Moreover, we optimize both computational efficiency and video quality according to different application scenarios. In the interpolation mode, given one or more keyframes rendered by diffusion models, FastBlend can render the whole video. Since FastBlend does not modify the generation process of diffusion models, it exhibits excellent compatibility. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of FastBlend. In the blending mode, FastBlend outperforms existing methods for video deflickering and video synthesis.

Video-LLaVA: Learning United Visual Representation by Alignment Before   Projection,"Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Bin Zhu, Jiaxi Cui, Munan Ning, Peng Jin, Li Yuan","The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) has enhanced the performance of various downstream tasks in visual-language understanding. Most existing approaches encode images and videos into separate feature spaces, which are then fed as inputs to large language models. However, due to the lack of unified tokenization for images and videos, namely misalignment before projection, it becomes challenging for a Large Language Model (LLM) to learn multi-modal interactions from several poor projection layers. In this work, we unify visual representation into the language feature space to advance the foundational LLM towards a unified LVLM. As a result, we establish a simple but robust LVLM baseline, Video-LLaVA, which learns from a mixed dataset of images and videos, mutually enhancing each other. Video-LLaVA achieves superior performances on a broad range of 9 image benchmarks across 5 image question-answering datasets and 4 image benchmark toolkits.

Scene Matters: Model-based Deep Video Compression,"Lv Tang, Xinfeng Zhang, Gai Zhang, Xiaoqi Ma","Video compression has always been a popular research area, where many traditional and deep video compression methods have been proposed. These methods typically rely on signal prediction theory to enhance compression performance by designing high efficient intra and inter prediction strategies and compressing video frames one by one. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based video compression (MVC) framework that regards scenes as the fundamental units for video sequences. Our proposed MVC directly models the intensity variation of the entire video sequence in one scene, seeking non-redundant representations instead of reducing redundancy through spatio-temporal predictions. To achieve this, we employ implicit neural representation as our basic modeling architecture. To improve the efficiency of video modeling, we first propose context-related spatial positional embedding and frequency domain supervision in spatial context enhancement.

To handle these problems, we propose a robust and efficient system for unconstrained video-based face recognition, which is composed of modules for face/fiducial detection, face association, and face recognition. First, we use multi-scale single-shot face detectors to efficiently localize faces in videos.

VIOLET : End-to-End Video-Language Transformers with Masked Visual-token   Modeling,"Tsu-Jui Fu, Linjie Li, Zhe Gan, Kevin Lin, William Yang Wang, Lijuan Wang, Zicheng Liu","A great challenge in video-language (VidL) modeling lies in the disconnection between fixed video representations extracted from image/video understanding models and downstream VidL data. Recent studies try to mitigate this disconnection via end-to-end training. To make it computationally feasible, prior works tend to ""imagify"" video inputs, i.e., a handful of sparsely sampled frames are fed into a 2D CNN, followed by a simple mean-pooling or concatenation to obtain the overall video representations. Although achieving promising results, such simple approaches may lose temporal information that is essential for performing downstream VidL tasks. In this work, we present VIOLET, a fully end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer, which adopts a video transformer to explicitly model the temporal dynamics of video inputs. Further, unlike previous studies that found pre-training tasks on video inputs (e.g., masked frame modeling) not very effective, we design a new pre-training task, Masked Visual-token Modeling (MVM), for better video modeling. Specifically, the original video frame patches are ""tokenized"" into discrete visual tokens, and the goal is to recover the original visual tokens based on the masked patches. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of both explicit temporal modeling via video transformer and MVM.

Action Recognition with Dynamic Image Networks,"Hakan Bilen, Basura Fernando, Efstratios Gavves, Andrea Vedaldi","We introduce the concept of ""dynamic image"", a novel compact representation of videos useful for video analysis, particularly in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A dynamic image encodes temporal data such as RGB or optical flow videos by using the concept of `rank pooling'. The idea is to learn a ranking machine that captures the temporal evolution of the data and to use the parameters of the latter as a representation. When a linear ranking machine is used, the resulting representation is in the form of an image, which we call dynamic because it summarizes the video dynamics in addition of appearance. This is a powerful idea because it allows to convert any video to an image so that existing CNN models pre-trained for the analysis of still images can be immediately extended to videos. We also present an efficient and effective approximate rank pooling operator, accelerating standard rank pooling algorithms by orders of magnitude, and formulate that as a CNN layer. This new layer allows generalizing dynamic images to dynamic feature maps.

Large Motion Video Autoencoding with Cross-modal Video VAE,"Yazhou Xing, Yang Fei, Yingqing He, Jingye Chen, Jiaxin Xie, Xiaowei Chi, Qifeng Chen","Learning a robust video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is essential for reducing video redundancy and facilitating efficient video generation. Directly applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal compression. Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression; however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance. In this paper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of high-fidelity video encoding. First, we observe that entangling spatial and temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts. Thus, we propose temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial information. Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model for further temporal compression. Second, we propose to leverage the textual information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance into our model. This significantly enhances reconstruction quality, particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability. Third, we further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both images and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also enables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding.

VicTR: Video-conditioned Text Representations for Activity Recognition,"Kumara Kahatapitiya, Anurag Arnab, Arsha Nagrani, Michael S. Ryoo","Vision-Language models (VLMs) have excelled in the image-domain -- especially in zero-shot settings -- thanks to the availability of vast pretraining data (i.e., paired image-text samples). However for videos, such paired data is not as abundant. Therefore, video-VLMs are usually designed by adapting pretrained image-VLMs to the video-domain, instead of training from scratch. All such recipes rely on augmenting visual embeddings with temporal information (i.e., image $\rightarrow$ video), often keeping text embeddings unchanged or even being discarded. In this paper, we argue the contrary, that better video-VLMs can be designed by focusing more on augmenting text, rather than visual information. More specifically, we introduce Video-conditioned Text Representations (VicTR): a form of text embeddings optimized w.r.t. visual embeddings, creating a more-flexible contrastive latent space. Our model can further make use of freely-available semantic information, in the form of visually-grounded auxiliary text (e.g. object or scene information). We evaluate our model on few-shot, zero-shot (HMDB-51, UCF-101), short-form (Kinetics-400) and long-form (Charades) activity recognition benchmarks, showing strong performance among video-VLMs.",2023-04-05T16:30:36Z,2024-03-29T16:56:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02560v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02560v2,cs.CV
Beyond Deepfake Images: Detecting AI-Generated Videos,"Danial Samadi Vahdati, Tai D. Nguyen, Aref Azizpour, Matthew C. Stamm","Recent advances in generative AI have led to the development of techniques to generate visually realistic synthetic video. While a number of techniques have been developed to detect AI-generated synthetic images, in this paper we show that synthetic image detectors are unable to detect synthetic videos. We demonstrate that this is because synthetic video generators introduce substantially different traces than those left by image generators. Despite this, we show that synthetic video traces can be learned, and used to perform reliable synthetic video detection or generator source attribution even after H.264 re-compression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while detecting videos from new generators through zero-shot transferability is challenging, accurate detection of videos from a new generator can be achieved through few-shot learning.",2024-04-24T16:19:31Z,2024-04-24T16:19:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15955v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15955v1,cs.CV
User-generated Video Quality Assessment: A Subjective and Objective   Study,"Yang Li, Shengbin Meng, Xinfeng Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Yue Wang, Siwei Ma","Recently, we have observed an exponential increase of user-generated content (UGC) videos. The distinguished characteristic of UGC videos originates from the video production and delivery chain, as they are usually acquired and processed by non-professional users before uploading to the hosting platforms for sharing. As such, these videos usually undergo multiple distortion stages that may affect visual quality before ultimately being viewed. Inspired by the increasing consensus that the optimization of the video coding and processing shall be fully driven by the perceptual quality, in this paper, we propose to study the quality of the UGC videos from both objective and subjective perspectives. We first construct a UGC video quality assessment (VQA) database, aiming to provide useful guidance for the UGC video coding and processing in the hosting platform. The database contains source UGC videos uploaded to the platform and their transcoded versions that are ultimately enjoyed by end-users, along with their subjective scores. Furthermore, we develop an objective quality assessment algorithm that automatically evaluates the quality of the transcoded videos based on the corrupted reference, which is in accordance with the application scenarios of UGC video sharing in the hosting platforms. The information from the corrupted reference is well leveraged and the quality is predicted based on the inferred quality maps with deep neural networks (DNN). Experimental results show that the proposed method yields superior performance. Both subjective and objective evaluations of the UGC videos also shed lights on the design of perceptual UGC video coding.",2020-05-18T08:36:11Z,2020-05-18T08:36:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08527v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08527v1,"cs.MM, eess.IV"
VEnhancer: Generative Space-Time Enhancement for Video Generation,"Jingwen He, Tianfan Xue, Dongyang Liu, Xinqi Lin, Peng Gao, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Wanli Ouyang, Ziwei Liu","We present VEnhancer, a generative space-time enhancement framework that improves the existing text-to-video results by adding more details in spatial domain and synthetic detailed motion in temporal domain. Given a generated low-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales through a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively removes generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated videos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train a video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low frame-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video ControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware conditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable during training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive experiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video super-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing AI-generated videos.

Towards Understanding Unsafe Video Generation,"Yan Pang, Aiping Xiong, Yang Zhang, Tianhao Wang","Video generation models (VGMs) have demonstrated the capability to synthesize high-quality output. It is important to understand their potential to produce unsafe content, such as violent or terrifying videos. In this work, we provide a comprehensive understanding of unsafe video generation.   First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos. After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political. With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos. Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set. With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs.   We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos. Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results. We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process. LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.",2024-07-17T14:07:22Z,2024-07-17T14:07:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12581v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12581v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CY"
HSTR-Net: High Spatio-Temporal Resolution Video Generation For Wide Area   Surveillance,"H. Umut Suluhan, Hasan F. Ates, Bahadir K. Gunturk","Wide area surveillance has many applications and tracking of objects under observation is an important task, which often needs high spatio-temporal resolution (HSTR) video for better precision. This paper presents the usage of multiple video feeds for the generation of HSTR video as an extension of reference based super resolution (RefSR). One feed captures video at high spatial resolution with low frame rate (HSLF) while the other captures low spatial resolution and high frame rate (LSHF) video simultaneously for the same scene. The main purpose is to create an HSTR video from the fusion of HSLF and LSHF videos. In this paper we propose an end-to-end trainable deep network that performs optical flow estimation and frame reconstruction by combining inputs from both video feeds. The proposed architecture provides significant improvement over existing video frame interpolation and RefSR techniques in terms of objective PSNR and SSIM metrics.",2022-04-09T09:23:58Z,2022-04-09T09:23:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04435v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04435v1,"cs.CV, eess.IV"
The benefits of synthetic data for action categorization,"Mohamad Ballout, Mohammad Tuqan, Daniel Asmar, Elie Shammas, George Sakr","In this paper, we study the value of using synthetically produced videos as training data for neural networks used for action categorization. Motivated by the fact that texture and background of a video play little to no significant roles in optical flow, we generated simplified texture-less and background-less videos and utilized the synthetic data to train a Temporal Segment Network (TSN). The results demonstrated that augmenting TSN with simplified synthetic data improved the original network accuracy (68.5%), achieving 71.8% on HMDB-51 when adding 4,000 videos and 72.4% when adding 8,000 videos. Also, training using simplified synthetic videos alone on 25 classes of UCF-101 achieved 30.71% when trained on 2500 videos and 52.7% when trained on 5000 videos.

Deep Learning for Video-based Person Re-Identification: A Survey,Khawar Islam,"Video-based person re-identification (video re-ID) has lately fascinated growing attention due to its broad practical applications in various areas, such as surveillance, smart city, and public safety. Nevertheless, video re-ID is quite difficult and is an ongoing stage due to numerous uncertain challenges such as viewpoint, occlusion, pose variation, and uncertain video sequence, etc. In the last couple of years, deep learning on video re-ID has continuously achieved surprising results on public datasets, with various approaches being developed to handle diverse problems in video re-ID. Compared to image-based re-ID, video re-ID is much more challenging and complex. To encourage future research and challenges, this first comprehensive paper introduces a review of up-to-date advancements in deep learning approaches for video re-ID.

Circular Rectifiction of 3D Video and Efficient Modification of 3D-HEVC,"Jarosław Samelak, Marek Domański","Video acquired from multiple cameras located along a line is often rectified to video virtually obtained from cameras with ideally parallel optical axes collocated on a single plane and principal points on a line. Such an approach simplifies video processing including depth estimation and compression. Nowadays, for many application video, like virtual reality or virtual navigation, the content is often acquired by cameras located nearly on a circle or on a part of that. Therefore, we introduce new operation of circular rectification that results in multiview video virtually obtained from cameras located on an ideal arc and with optical axes that are collocated on a single plane and they intersect in a single point. For the circularly rectified video, depth estimation and compression are simplified. The standard 3DHEVC codec was designed for rectified video and its efficiency is limited for video acquired from cameras located on an arc. Therefore, we developed a 3-D HEVC codec modified in order to compress efficiently circularly rectified video. The experiments demonstrate its better performance than for the standard 3D-HEVC codec.",2023-06-09T22:25:29Z,2023-06-09T22:25:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06285v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06285v1,"cs.MM, eess.IV"

Immersive Video Compression using Implicit Neural Representations,"Ho Man Kwan, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David Bull","Recent work on implicit neural representations (INRs) has evidenced their potential for efficiently representing and encoding conventional video content. In this paper we, for the first time, extend their application to immersive (multi-view) videos, by proposing MV-HiNeRV, a new INR-based immersive video codec. MV-HiNeRV is an enhanced version of a state-of-the-art INR-based video codec, HiNeRV, which was developed for single-view video compression. We have modified the model to learn a different group of feature grids for each view, and share the learnt network parameters among all views. This enables the model to effectively exploit the spatio-temporal and the inter-view redundancy that exists within multi-view videos. The proposed codec was used to compress multi-view texture and depth video sequences in the MPEG Immersive Video (MIV) Common Test Conditions, and tested against the MIV Test model (TMIV) that uses the VVenC video codec. The results demonstrate the superior performance of MV-HiNeRV, with significant coding gains (up to 72.33\%) over TMIV.

Distilling Vision-Language Models on Millions of Videos,"Yue Zhao, Long Zhao, Xingyi Zhou, Jialin Wu, Chun-Te Chu, Hui Miao, Florian Schroff, Hartwig Adam, Ting Liu, Boqing Gong, Philipp Krähenbühl, Liangzhe Yuan","The recent advance in vision-language models is largely attributed to the abundance of image-text data. We aim to replicate this success for video-language models, but there simply is not enough human-curated video-text data available. We thus resort to fine-tuning a video-language model from a strong image-language baseline with synthesized instructional data. The resulting video model by video-instruction-tuning (VIIT) is then used to auto-label millions of videos to generate high-quality captions. We show the adapted video-language model performs well on a wide range of video-language benchmarks. For instance, it surpasses the best prior result on open-ended NExT-QA by 2.8%. Besides, our model generates detailed descriptions for previously unseen videos, which provide better textual supervision than existing methods. Experiments show that a video-language dual-encoder model contrastively trained on these auto-generated captions is 3.8% better than the strongest baseline that also leverages vision-language models.

Unified Single-Image and Video Super-Resolution via Denoising Algorithms,"Alon Brifman, Yaniv Romano, Michael Elad","Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) aims to recover a high-resolution image from a given low-resolution version of it. Video Super Resolution (VSR) targets series of given images, aiming to fuse them to create a higher resolution outcome. Although SISR and VSR seem to have a lot in common, most SISR algorithms do not have a simple and direct extension to VSR. VSR is considered a more challenging inverse problem, mainly due to its reliance on a sub-pixel accurate motion-estimation, which has no parallel in SISR. Another complication is the dynamics of the video, often addressed by simply generating a single frame instead of a complete output sequence.   In this work we suggest a simple and robust super-resolution framework that can be applied to single images and easily extended to video. Our work relies on the observation that denoising of images and videos is well-managed and very effectively treated by a variety of methods. We exploit the Plug-and-Play-Prior framework and the Regularization-by-Denoising (RED) approach that extends it, and show how to use such denoisers in order to handle the SISR and the VSR problems using a unified formulation and framework. This way, we benefit from the effectiveness and efficiency of existing image/video denoising algorithms, while solving much more challenging problems. More specifically, harnessing the VBM3D video denoiser, we obtain a strongly competitive motion-estimation free VSR algorithm, showing tendency to a high-quality output and fast processing.",2018-10-03T20:05:07Z,2018-10-03T20:05:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01938v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01938v1,eess.IV
Tuning-Free Noise Rectification for High Fidelity Image-to-Video   Generation,"Weijie Li, Litong Gong, Yiran Zhu, Fanda Fan, Biao Wang, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng","Image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks always suffer from keeping high fidelity in the open domains. Traditional image animation techniques primarily focus on specific domains such as faces or human poses, making them difficult to generalize to open domains. Several recent I2V frameworks based on diffusion models can generate dynamic content for open domain images but fail to maintain fidelity. We found that two main factors of low fidelity are the loss of image details and the noise prediction biases during the denoising process. To this end, we propose an effective method that can be applied to mainstream video diffusion models. This method achieves high fidelity based on supplementing more precise image information and noise rectification. Specifically, given a specified image, our method first adds noise to the input image latent to keep more details, then denoises the noisy latent with proper rectification to alleviate the noise prediction biases. Our method is tuning-free and plug-and-play. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the fidelity of generated videos.

While there exist large text corpora and image-text pairs, high-quality video-text data is much harder to collect. First of all, manual labeling is more time-consuming, as it requires an annotator to watch an entire video. Second, videos have a temporal dimension, consisting of several scenes stacked together, and showing multiple actions. Accordingly, to establish a video dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as textual video description, subtitles, and individual video frames. Specifically, we curate 3.8M high-resolution videos from the publicly available HD-VILA-100M dataset. We then split them into semantically consistent video clips, and apply multiple cross-modality teacher models to obtain captions for each video. Next, we finetune a retrieval model on a small subset where the best caption of each video is manually selected and then employ the model in the whole dataset to select the best caption as the annotation. In this way, we get 70M videos paired with high-quality text captions. We dub the dataset as Panda-70M.

Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself.

In this work, we introduce Control-A-Video, a controllable T2V diffusion model that can generate videos conditioned on text prompts and reference control maps like edge and depth maps. To tackle video quality and motion consistency issues, we propose novel strategies to incorporate content prior and motion prior into the diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we employ a first-frame condition scheme to transfer video generation from the image domain. Additionally, we introduce residual-based and optical flow-based noise initialization to infuse motion priors from reference videos, promoting relevance among frame latents for reduced flickering. Furthermore, we present a Spatio-Temporal Reward Feedback Learning (ST-ReFL) algorithm that optimizes the video diffusion model using multiple reward models for video quality and motion consistency, leading to superior outputs.

CrossVideoMAE: Self-Supervised Image-Video Representation Learning with   Masked Autoencoders,"Shihab Aaqil Ahamed, Malitha Gunawardhana, Liel David, Michael Sidorov, Daniel Harari, Muhammad Haris Khan","Current video-based Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) primarily focus on learning effective spatiotemporal representations from a visual perspective, which may lead the model to prioritize general spatial-temporal patterns but often overlook nuanced semantic attributes like specific interactions or sequences that define actions - such as action-specific features that align more closely with human cognition for space-time correspondence. This can limit the model's ability to capture the essence of certain actions that are contextually rich and continuous. Humans are capable of mapping visual concepts, object view invariance, and semantic attributes available in static instances to comprehend natural dynamic scenes or videos. Existing MAEs for videos and static images rely on separate datasets for videos and images, which may lack the rich semantic attributes necessary for fully understanding the learned concepts, especially when compared to using video and corresponding sampled frame images together. To this end, we propose CrossVideoMAE an end-to-end self-supervised cross-modal contrastive learning MAE that effectively learns both video-level and frame-level rich spatiotemporal representations and semantic attributes. Our method integrates mutual spatiotemporal information from videos with spatial information from sampled frames within a feature-invariant space, while encouraging invariance to augmentations within the video domain. This objective is achieved through jointly embedding features of visible tokens and combining feature correspondence within and across modalities, which is critical for acquiring rich, label-free guiding signals from both video and frame image modalities in a self-supervised manner.

In recent years, many video stabilization algorithms have been proposed, yet no specific and accurate metric enables comprehensively evaluating the stability of videos. Indeed, most existing quality assessment models evaluate video quality as a whole without specifically taking the subjective experience of video stability into consideration. Therefore, these models cannot measure the video stability explicitly and precisely when severe shakes are present. In addition, there is no large-scale video database in public that includes various degrees of shaky videos with the corresponding subjective scores available, which hinders the development of Video Quality Assessment for Stability (VQA-S). To this end, we build a new database named StableDB that contains 1,952 diversely-shaky UGC videos, where each video has a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on the degree of video stability rated by 34 subjects. Moreover, we elaborately design a novel VQA-S model named StableVQA, which consists of three feature extractors to acquire the optical flow, semantic, and blur features respectively, and a regression layer to predict the final stability score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the StableVQA achieves a higher correlation with subjective opinions than the existing VQA-S models and generic VQA models.

Deep Learning-Based Real-Time Quality Control of Standard Video   Compression for Live Streaming,"Matin Mortaheb, Mohammad A. Amir Khojastepour, Srimat T. Chakradhar, Sennur Ulukus","Ensuring high-quality video content for wireless users has become increasingly vital. Nevertheless, maintaining a consistent level of video quality faces challenges due to the fluctuating encoded bitrate, primarily caused by dynamic video content, especially in live streaming scenarios. Video compression is typically employed to eliminate unnecessary redundancies within and between video frames, thereby reducing the required bandwidth for video transmission. The encoded bitrate and the quality of the compressed video depend on encoder parameters, specifically, the quantization parameter (QP). Poor choices of encoder parameters can result in reduced bandwidth efficiency and high likelihood of non-conformance. Non-conformance refers to the violation of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) constraint for an encoded video segment. To address these issues, a real-time deep learning-based H.264 controller is proposed. This controller dynamically estimates the optimal encoder parameters based on the content of a video chunk with minimal delay. The objective is to maintain video quality in terms of PSNR above a specified threshold while minimizing the average bitrate of the compressed video. Experimental results, conducted on both QCIF dataset and a diverse range of random videos from public datasets, validate the effectiveness of this approach. Notably, it achieves improvements of up to 2.5 times in average bandwidth usage compared to the state-of-the-art adaptive bitrate video streaming, with a negligible non-conformance probability below $10^{-2}$.",2023-11-21T18:28:35Z,2023-11-21T18:28:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12918v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12918v1,"eess.IV, cs.IT, cs.LG, cs.NI, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.IT"
Illumination Histogram Consistency Metric for Quantitative Assessment of   Video Sequences,"Long Chen, Mobarakol Islam, Matt Clarkson, Thomas Dowrick","The advances in deep generative models have greatly accelerate the process of video procession such as video enhancement and synthesis. Learning spatio-temporal video models requires to capture the temporal dynamics of a scene, in addition to the visual appearance of individual frames. Illumination consistency, which reflects the variations of illumination in the dynamic video sequences, play a vital role in video processing. Unfortunately, to date, no well-accepted quantitative metric has been proposed for video illumination consistency evaluation. In this paper, we propose a illumination histogram consistency (IHC) metric to quantitatively and automatically evaluate the illumination consistency of the video sequences. IHC measures the illumination variation of any video sequence based on the illumination histogram discrepancies across all the frames in the video sequence. Specifically, given a video sequence, we first estimate the illumination map of each individual frame using the Retinex model; Then, using the illumination maps, the mean illumination histogram of the video sequence is computed by the mean operation across all the frames; Next, we compute the illumination histogram discrepancy between each individual frame and the mean illumination histogram and sum up all the illumination histogram discrepancies to represent the illumination variations of the video sequence. Finally, we obtain the IHC score from the illumination histogram discrepancies via normalization and subtraction operations. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed IHC metric and its capability to measure the illumination variations in video sequences.

Boosting Breast Ultrasound Video Classification by the Guidance of   Keyframe Feature Centers,"AnLan Sun, Zhao Zhang, Meng Lei, Yuting Dai, Dong Wang, Liwei Wang","Breast ultrasound videos contain richer information than ultrasound images, therefore it is more meaningful to develop video models for this diagnosis task. However, the collection of ultrasound video datasets is much harder. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of enhancing the performance of ultrasound video classification using the static image dataset. To this end, we propose KGA-Net and coherence loss. The KGA-Net adopts both video clips and static images to train the network. The coherence loss uses the feature centers generated by the static images to guide the frame attention in the video model. Our KGA-Net boosts the performance on the public BUSV dataset by a large margin. The visualization results of frame attention prove the explainability of our method.

AnyV2V: A Tuning-Free Framework For Any Video-to-Video Editing Tasks,"Max Ku, Cong Wei, Weiming Ren, Harry Yang, Wenhu Chen","In the dynamic field of digital content creation using generative models, state-of-the-art video editing models still do not offer the level of quality and control that users desire. Previous works on video editing either extended from image-based generative models in a zero-shot manner or necessitated extensive fine-tuning, which can hinder the production of fluid video edits. Furthermore, these methods frequently rely on textual input as the editing guidance, leading to ambiguities and limiting the types of edits they can perform. Recognizing these challenges, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel tuning-free paradigm designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model to generate the edited video through temporal feature injection. AnyV2V can leverage any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks, including prompt-based editing, reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. AnyV2V can also support any video length. Our evaluation shows that AnyV2V achieved CLIP-scores comparable to other baseline methods. Furthermore, AnyV2V significantly outperformed these baselines in human evaluations, demonstrating notable improvements in visual consistency with the source video while producing high-quality edits across all editing tasks.",2024-03-21T15:15:00Z,2024-11-03T21:16:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14468v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14468v4,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.MM"
FreeVA: Offline MLLM as Training-Free Video Assistant,Wenhao Wu,"This paper undertakes an empirical study to revisit the latest advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Video Assistant. This study, namely FreeVA, aims to extend existing image-based MLLM to the video domain in a training-free manner. The study provides an essential, yet must-know baseline, and reveals several surprising findings: 1) FreeVA, leveraging only offline image-based MLLM without additional training, excels in zero-shot video question-answering (e.g., MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA, and MSRVTT-QA), even surpassing state-of-the-art methods that involve video instruction tuning. 2) While mainstream video-based MLLMs typically initialize with an image-based MLLM (e.g., LLaVA) and then fine-tune using video instruction tuning, the study indicates that utilizing the widely adopted VideoInstruct-100K for video instruction tuning doesn't actually lead to better performance compared to not training at all. 3) The commonly used evaluation metrics in existing works are significantly influenced by changes in the GPT API version over time. If ignored, this could affect the fairness and uniformity of comparisons between different methods and impact the analysis and judgment of researchers in the field. The advancement of MLLMs is currently thriving, drawing numerous researchers into the field. We aim for this work to serve as a plug-and-play, simple yet effective baseline, encouraging the direct evaluation of existing MLLMs in video domain while also standardizing the field of video conversational models to a certain extent.

Magic 1-For-1: Generating One Minute Video Clips within One Minute,"Hongwei Yi, Shitong Shao, Tian Ye, Jiantong Zhao, Qingyu Yin, Michael Lingelbach, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian, Enze Xie, Daquan Zhou","In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations.

AIGCBench tackles the limitations of existing benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including a varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different state-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text combiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate images via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation framework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics spanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video quality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed correlates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive experiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field.

Relying on temporal continuity in videos, our work assumes that the 3D scene structure in nearby video frames remains static. Given a sequence of video frames as input, the video autoencoder extracts a disentangled representation of the scene includ- ing: (i) a temporally-consistent deep voxel feature to represent the 3D structure and (ii) a 3D trajectory of camera pose for each frame. These two representations will then be re-entangled for rendering the input video frames. This video autoencoder can be trained directly using a pixel reconstruction loss, without any ground truth 3D or camera pose annotations. The disentangled representation can be applied to a range of tasks, including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, and video generation by motion following.

However, local video editing, particularly removal of small attributes like glasses, remains a challenge. Existing methods either alter the videos excessively, generate unrealistic artifacts, or fail to perform the requested edit consistently throughout the video. In this work, we focus on consistent and identity-preserving removal of glasses in videos, using it as a case study for consistent local attribute removal in videos. Due to the lack of paired data, we adopt a weakly supervised approach and generate synthetic imperfect data, using an adjusted pretrained diffusion model. We show that despite data imperfection, by learning from our generated data and leveraging the prior of pretrained diffusion models, our model is able to perform the desired edit consistently while preserving the original video content.

Deep Video Prior for Video Consistency and Propagation,"Chenyang Lei, Yazhou Xing, Hao Ouyang, Qifeng Chen","Applying an image processing algorithm independently to each video frame often leads to temporal inconsistency in the resulting video. To address this issue, we present a novel and general approach for blind video temporal consistency. Our method is only trained on a pair of original and processed videos directly instead of a large dataset. Unlike most previous methods that enforce temporal consistency with optical flow, we show that temporal consistency can be achieved by training a convolutional neural network on a video with Deep Video Prior (DVP). Moreover, a carefully designed iteratively reweighted training strategy is proposed to address the challenging multimodal inconsistency problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 7 computer vision tasks on videos. Extensive quantitative and perceptual experiments show that our approach obtains superior performance than state-of-the-art methods on blind video temporal consistency. We further extend DVP to video propagation and demonstrate its effectiveness in propagating three different types of information (color, artistic style, and object segmentation).

CLIP meets GamePhysics: Towards bug identification in gameplay videos   using zero-shot transfer learning,"Mohammad Reza Taesiri, Finlay Macklon, Cor-Paul Bezemer","Gameplay videos contain rich information about how players interact with the game and how the game responds. Sharing gameplay videos on social media platforms, such as Reddit, has become a common practice for many players. Often, players will share gameplay videos that showcase video game bugs. Such gameplay videos are software artifacts that can be utilized for game testing, as they provide insight for bug analysis. Although large repositories of gameplay videos exist, parsing and mining them in an effective and structured fashion has still remained a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a search method that accepts any English text query as input to retrieve relevant videos from large repositories of gameplay videos. Our approach does not rely on any external information (such as video metadata); it works solely based on the content of the video. By leveraging the zero-shot transfer capabilities of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, our approach does not require any data labeling or training.

Unlocking Masked Autoencoders as Loss Function for Image and Video   Restoration,"Man Zhou, Naishan Zheng, Jie Huang, Chunle Guo, Chongyi Li","Image and video restoration has achieved a remarkable leap with the advent of deep learning.

With the question ``are the de facto optimization functions e.g., $L_1$, $L_2$, and perceptual losses optimal?'', we explore the potential of loss and raise our belief ``learned loss function empowers the learning capability of neural networks for image and video restoration''.   Concretely, we stand on the shoulders of the masked Autoencoders (MAE) and formulate it as a `learned loss function', owing to the fact the pre-trained MAE innately inherits the prior of image reasoning. We investigate the efficacy of our belief from three perspectives: 1) from task-customized MAE to native MAE, 2) from image task to video task, and 3) from transformer structure to convolution neural network structure. Extensive experiments across multiple image and video tasks, including image denoising, image super-resolution, image enhancement, guided image super-resolution, video denoising, and video enhancement, demonstrate the consistent performance improvements introduced by the learned loss function.

We first train a neural network for generating photorealistic stylized 3D LUTs on a large-scale dataset; then, when performing photorealistic style transfer for a specific video, we select a keyframe and style image in the video as the data source and fine-turn the neural network; finally, we query the 3D LUTs generated by the fine-tuned neural network for the colors in the video, resulting in a super-fast photorealistic style transfer, even processing 8K video takes less than 2 millisecond per frame.

Then we develop a key-frame assisted video super-resolution model to reconstruct the high-quality video at the cloud side. Moreover, we propose a strategy of extracting key frames from source videos for better reconstruction performance by utilizing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of adjacent frames to measure the propagation distance of key frame information. Simulation results show that the developed system can effectively reduce the data volume by the end-cloud collaboration and outperforms existing video super-resolution models significantly in terms of PSNR and structural similarity index (SSIM).",2023-11-08T13:45:06Z,2023-11-08T13:45:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04685v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04685v1,eess.IV
SEINE: Short-to-Long Video Diffusion Model for Generative Transition and   Prediction,"Xinyuan Chen, Yaohui Wang, Lingjun Zhang, Shaobin Zhuang, Xin Ma, Jiashuo Yu, Yali Wang, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu","Recently video generation has achieved substantial progress with realistic results. Nevertheless, existing AI-generated videos are usually very short clips (""shot-level"") depicting a single scene. To deliver a coherent long video (""story-level""), it is desirable to have creative transition and prediction effects across different clips. This paper presents a short-to-long video diffusion model, SEINE, that focuses on generative transition and prediction. The goal is to generate high-quality long videos with smooth and creative transitions between scenes and varying lengths of shot-level videos. Specifically, we propose a random-mask video diffusion model to automatically generate transitions based on textual descriptions. By providing the images of different scenes as inputs, combined with text-based control, our model generates transition videos that ensure coherence and visual quality. Furthermore, the model can be readily extended to various tasks such as image-to-video animation and autoregressive video prediction. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this new generative task, we propose three assessing criteria for smooth and creative transition: temporal consistency, semantic similarity, and video-text semantic alignment. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods for generative transition and prediction, enabling the creation of story-level long videos.

Turns Out I'm Not Real: Towards Robust Detection of AI-Generated Videos,"Qingyuan Liu, Pengyuan Shi, Yun-Yun Tsai, Chengzhi Mao, Junfeng Yang","The impressive achievements of generative models in creating high-quality videos have raised concerns about digital integrity and privacy vulnerabilities. Recent works to combat Deepfakes videos have developed detectors that are highly accurate at identifying GAN-generated samples. However, the robustness of these detectors on diffusion-generated videos generated from video creation tools (e.g., SORA by OpenAI, Runway Gen-2, and Pika, etc.) is still unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting videos synthesized from multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models, such as Stable Video Diffusion. We find that the SOTA methods for detecting diffusion-generated images lack robustness in identifying diffusion-generated videos. Our analysis reveals that the effectiveness of these detectors diminishes when applied to out-of-domain videos, primarily because they struggle to track the temporal features and dynamic variations between frames. To address the above-mentioned challenge, we collect a new benchmark video dataset for diffusion-generated videos using SOTA video creation tools. We extract representation within explicit knowledge from the diffusion model for video frames and train our detector with a CNN + LSTM architecture. The evaluation shows that our framework can well capture the temporal features between frames, achieves 93.7% detection accuracy for in-domain videos, and improves the accuracy of out-domain videos by up to 16 points.",2024-06-13T21:52:49Z,2024-06-13T21:52:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09601v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09601v1,cs.CV

She, Mushui Liu, Jingxuan Pang, Jin Wang, Zhen Yang, Wanggui He, Guanghao Zhang, Yi Wang, Qihan Huang, Haobin Tang, Yunlong Yu, Siming Fu","Customized generation has achieved significant progress in image synthesis, yet personalized video generation remains challenging due to temporal inconsistencies and quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce CustomVideoX, an innovative framework leveraging the video diffusion transformer for personalized video generation from a reference image. CustomVideoX capitalizes on pre-trained video networks by exclusively training the LoRA parameters to extract reference features, ensuring both efficiency and adaptability. To facilitate seamless interaction between the reference image and video content, we propose 3D Reference Attention, which enables direct and simultaneous engagement of reference image features with all video frames across spatial and temporal dimensions. To mitigate the excessive influence of reference image features and textual guidance on generated video content during inference, we implement the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB) strategy, dynamically modulating reference bias over different time steps. Additionally, we introduce the Entity Region-Aware Enhancement (ERAE) module, aligning highly activated regions of key entity tokens with reference feature injection by adjusting attention bias. To thoroughly evaluate personalized video generation, we establish a new benchmark, VideoBench, comprising over 50 objects and 100 prompts for extensive assessment.

Saliency detection with moving camera via background model completion,"Yupei Zhang, Kwok-Leung Chan","To detect saliency in video is a fundamental step in many computer vision systems. Saliency is the significant target(s) in the video. The object of interest is further analyzed for high-level applications. The segregation of saliency and the background can be made if they exhibit different visual cues. Therefore, saliency detection is often formulated as background subtraction. However, saliency detection is challenging. For instance, dynamic background can result in false positive errors. In another scenario, camouflage will lead to false negative errors. With moving camera, the captured scenes are even more complicated to handle. We propose a new framework, called saliency detection via background model completion (SD-BMC), that comprises of a background modeler and the deep learning background/foreground segmentation network. The background modeler generates an initial clean background image from a short image sequence. Based on the idea of video completion, a good background frame can be synthesized with the co-existence of changing background and moving objects. We adopt the background/foreground segmenter, although pre-trained with a specific video dataset, can also detect saliency in unseen videos. The background modeler can adjust the background image dynamically when the background/foreground segmenter output deteriorates during processing of a long video. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one to adopt video completion for background modeling and saliency detection in videos captured by moving camera. The results, obtained from the PTZ videos, show that our proposed framework outperforms some deep learning-based background subtraction models by 11% or more. With more challenging videos, our framework also outperforms many high ranking background subtraction methods by more than 3%.",2021-10-30T11:17:58Z,2021-10-30T11:17:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01681v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01681v1,"cs.CV, eess.IV, I.4.0; I.5.4"

Although commercial tools can generate plausible videos, there is a limited number of open-source models available for researchers and engineers. In this work, we introduce two diffusion models for high-quality video generation, namely text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models. T2V models synthesize a video based on a given text input, while I2V models incorporate an additional image input. Our proposed T2V model can generate realistic and cinematic-quality videos with a resolution of $1024 \times 576$, outperforming other open-source T2V models in terms of quality. The I2V model is designed to produce videos that strictly adhere to the content of the provided reference image, preserving its content, structure, and style. This model is the first open-source I2V foundation model capable of transforming a given image into a video clip while maintaining content preservation constraints.

SSGVS: Semantic Scene Graph-to-Video Synthesis,"Yuren Cong, Jinhui Yi, Bodo Rosenhahn, Michael Ying Yang","As a natural extension of the image synthesis task, video synthesis has attracted a lot of interest recently. Many image synthesis works utilize class labels or text as guidance. However, neither labels nor text can provide explicit temporal guidance, such as when an action starts or ends. To overcome this limitation, we introduce semantic video scene graphs as input for video synthesis, as they represent the spatial and temporal relationships between objects in the scene. Since video scene graphs are usually temporally discrete annotations, we propose a video scene graph (VSG) encoder that not only encodes the existing video scene graphs but also predicts the graph representations for unlabeled frames. The VSG encoder is pre-trained with different contrastive multi-modal losses. A semantic scene graph-to-video synthesis framework (SSGVS), based on the pre-trained VSG encoder, VQ-VAE, and auto-regressive Transformer, is proposed to synthesize a video given an initial scene image and a non-fixed number of semantic scene graphs. We evaluate SSGVS and other state-of-the-art video synthesis models on the Action Genome dataset and demonstrate the positive significance of video scene graphs in video synthesis.

A Beam-Segmenting Polar Format Algorithm Based on Double PCS for Video   SAR Persistent Imaging,"Jiawei Jiang, Yinwei Li, Shaowen Luo, Ping Li, Yiming Zhu","Video synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is attracting more attention in recent years due to its abilities of high resolution, high frame rate and advantages in continuous observation. Generally, the polar format algorithm (PFA) is an efficient algorithm for spotlight mode video SAR. However, in the process of PFA, the wavefront curvature error (WCE) limits the imaging scene size and the 2-D interpolation affects the efficiency. To solve the aforementioned problems, a beam-segmenting PFA based on principle of chirp scaling (PCS), called BS-PCS-PFA, is proposed for video SAR imaging, which has the capability of persistent imaging for different carrier frequencies video SAR. Firstly, an improved PCS applicable to video SAR PFA is proposed to replace the 2-D interpolation and the coarse image in the ground output coordinate system (GOCS) is obtained. As for the distortion or defocus existing in the coarse image, a novel sub-block imaging method based on beam-segmenting fast filtering is proposed to segment the image into multiple sub-beam data, whose distortion and defocus can be ignored when the equivalent size of sub-block is smaller than the distortion negligible region. Through processing the sub-beam data and mosaicking the refocused subimages, the full image in GOCS without distortion and defocus is obtained. Moreover, a three-step MoCo method is applied to the algorithm for the adaptability to the actual irregular trajectories. The proposed method can significantly expand the effective scene size of PFA, and the better operational efficiency makes it more suitable for video SAR imaging. The feasibility of the algorithm is verified by the experimental data.",2023-12-19T14:39:49Z,2023-12-19T14:39:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10252v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10252v1,cs.CV
Layered Neural Atlases for Consistent Video Editing,"Yoni Kasten, Dolev Ofri, Oliver Wang, Tali Dekel","We present a method that decomposes, or ""unwraps"", an input video into a set of layered 2D atlases, each providing a unified representation of the appearance of an object (or background) over the video. For each pixel in the video, our method estimates its corresponding 2D coordinate in each of the atlases, giving us a consistent parameterization of the video, along with an associated alpha (opacity) value. Importantly, we design our atlases to be interpretable and semantic, which facilitates easy and intuitive editing in the atlas domain, with minimal manual work required. Edits applied to a single 2D atlas (or input video frame) are automatically and consistently mapped back to the original video frames, while preserving occlusions, deformation, and other complex scene effects such as shadows and reflections. Our method employs a coordinate-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) representation for mappings, atlases, and alphas, which are jointly optimized on a per-video basis, using a combination of video reconstruction and regularization losses. By operating purely in 2D, our method does not require any prior 3D knowledge about scene geometry or camera poses, and can handle complex dynamic real world videos. We demonstrate various video editing applications, including texture mapping, video style transfer, image-to-video texture transfer, and segmentation/labeling propagation, all automatically produced by editing a single 2D atlas image.",2021-09-23T14:58:59Z,2021-09-23T14:58:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11418v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11418v1,"cs.CV, cs.GR"
HateMM: A Multi-Modal Dataset for Hate Video Classification,"Mithun Das, Rohit Raj, Punyajoy Saha, Binny Mathew, Manish Gupta, Animesh Mukherjee","Hate speech has become one of the most significant issues in modern society, having implications in both the online and the offline world. Due to this, hate speech research has recently gained a lot of traction. However, most of the work has primarily focused on text media with relatively little work on images and even lesser on videos. Thus, early stage automated video moderation techniques are needed to handle the videos that are being uploaded to keep the platform safe and healthy. With a view to detect and remove hateful content from the video sharing platforms, our work focuses on hate video detection using multi-modalities. To this end, we curate ~43 hours of videos from BitChute and manually annotate them as hate or non-hate, along with the frame spans which could explain the labelling decision. To collect the relevant videos we harnessed search keywords from hate lexicons. We observe various cues in images and audio of hateful videos. Further, we build deep learning multi-modal models to classify the hate videos and observe that using all the modalities of the videos improves the overall hate speech detection performance (accuracy=0.798, macro F1-score=0.790) by ~5.7% compared to the best uni-modal model in terms of macro F1 score.

"Two Birds, One Stone: A Unified Framework for Joint Learning of Image   and Video Style Transfers","Bohai Gu, Heng Fan, Libo Zhang","Current arbitrary style transfer models are limited to either image or video domains. In order to achieve satisfying image and video style transfers, two different models are inevitably required with separate training processes on image and video domains, respectively. In this paper, we show that this can be precluded by introducing UniST, a Unified Style Transfer framework for both images and videos. At the core of UniST is a domain interaction transformer (DIT), which first explores context information within the specific domain and then interacts contextualized domain information for joint learning. In particular, DIT enables exploration of temporal information from videos for the image style transfer task and meanwhile allows rich appearance texture from images for video style transfer, thus leading to mutual benefits. Considering heavy computation of traditional multi-head self-attention, we present a simple yet effective axial multi-head self-attention (AMSA) for DIT, which improves computational efficiency while maintains style transfer performance. To verify the effectiveness of UniST, we conduct extensive experiments on both image and video style transfer tasks and show that UniST performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on both tasks.

VidCEP: Complex Event Processing Framework to Detect Spatiotemporal   Patterns in Video Streams,"Piyush Yadav, Edward Curry","Video data is highly expressive and has traditionally been very difficult for a machine to interpret. Querying event patterns from video streams is challenging due to its unstructured representation. Middleware systems such as Complex Event Processing (CEP) mine patterns from data streams and send notifications to users in a timely fashion. Current CEP systems have inherent limitations to query video streams due to their unstructured data model and lack of expressive query language. In this work, we focus on a CEP framework where users can define high-level expressive queries over videos to detect a range of spatiotemporal event patterns. In this context, we propose: i) VidCEP, an in-memory, on the fly, near real-time complex event matching framework for video streams. The system uses a graph-based event representation for video streams which enables the detection of high-level semantic concepts from video using cascades of Deep Neural Network models, ii) a Video Event Query language (VEQL) to express high-level user queries for video streams in CEP, iii) a complex event matcher to detect spatiotemporal video event patterns by matching expressive user queries over video data. The proposed approach detects spatiotemporal video event patterns with an F-score ranging from 0.66 to 0.89. VidCEP maintains near real-time performance with an average throughput of 70 frames per second for 5 parallel videos with sub-second matching latency.",2020-07-15T16:43:37Z,2020-07-15T16:43:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07817v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07817v1,"cs.CV, cs.DB, cs.MM, eess.IV"

Despite their success, these methods often require input reference frame or fail to generate diverse videos from the given data distribution, with little to no uniformity in the quality of videos that can be generated. Different from these methods, we focus on the problem of generating videos from latent noise vectors, without any reference input frames. To this end, we develop a novel approach that jointly optimizes the input latent space, the weights of a recurrent neural network and a generator through non-adversarial learning. Optimizing for the input latent space along with the network weights allows us to generate videos in a controlled environment, i.e., we can faithfully generate all videos the model has seen during the learning process as well as new unseen videos.

Streaming Video Model,"Yucheng Zhao, Chong Luo, Chuanxin Tang, Dongdong Chen, Noel Codella, Zheng-Jun Zha","Video understanding tasks have traditionally been modeled by two separate architectures, specially tailored for two distinct tasks. Sequence-based video tasks, such as action recognition, use a video backbone to directly extract spatiotemporal features, while frame-based video tasks, such as multiple object tracking (MOT), rely on single fixed-image backbone to extract spatial features. In contrast, we propose to unify video understanding tasks into one novel streaming video architecture, referred to as Streaming Vision Transformer (S-ViT). S-ViT first produces frame-level features with a memory-enabled temporally-aware spatial encoder to serve the frame-based video tasks. Then the frame features are input into a task-related temporal decoder to obtain spatiotemporal features for sequence-based tasks. The efficiency and efficacy of S-ViT is demonstrated by the state-of-the-art accuracy in the sequence-based action recognition task and the competitive advantage over conventional architecture in the frame-based MOT task.

However, when transferring them to the task of video retrieval, models still need to be fine-tuned on hand-curated paired text-video data to adapt to the diverse styles of video descriptions. To address this problem without the need for hand-annotated pairs, we propose a new setting, text-video retrieval with uncurated & unpaired data, that during training utilizes only text queries together with uncurated web videos without any paired text-video data. To this end, we propose an approach, In-Style, that learns the style of the text queries and transfers it to uncurated web videos.

To bridge this research gap, we propose Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) metric, which focuses on evaluating motion consistency in video generation.

A typical setting is deburring an image using a nearby sharp image(s) in a video sequence, as in the studies of video deblurring. This paper proposes a better method to use the information present in a reference image. The method does not need a strong assumption on the reference image. We can utilize an alternative shot of the identical scene, just like in video deblurring, or we can even employ a distinct image from another scene. Our method first matches local patches of the target and reference images and then fuses their features to estimate a sharp image. We employ a patch-based feature matching strategy to solve the difficult problem of matching the blurry image with the sharp reference. Our method can be integrated into pre-existing networks designed for single image deblurring. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2023-07-06T09:24:55Z,2023-07-06T09:24:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02875v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02875v1,cs.CV
Unsupervised video summarization framework using keyframe extraction and   video skimming,"Shruti Jadon, Mahmood Jasim","Video is one of the robust sources of information and the consumption of online and offline videos has reached an unprecedented level in the last few years. A fundamental challenge of extracting information from videos is a viewer has to go through the complete video to understand the context, as opposed to an image where the viewer can extract information from a single frame. Apart from context understanding, it almost impossible to create a universal summarized video for everyone, as everyone has their own bias of keyframe, e.g; In a soccer game, a coach person might consider those frames which consist of information on player placement, techniques, etc; however, a person with less knowledge about a soccer game, will focus more on frames which consist of goals and score-board. Therefore, if we were to tackle problem video summarization through a supervised learning path, it will require extensive personalized labeling of data. In this paper, we attempt to solve video summarization through unsupervised learning by employing traditional vision-based algorithmic methodologies for accurate feature extraction from video frames. We have also proposed a deep learning-based feature extraction followed by multiple clustering methods to find an effective way of summarizing a video by interesting key-frame extraction. We have compared the performance of these approaches on the SumMe dataset and showcased that using deep learning-based feature extraction has been proven to perform better in case of dynamic viewpoint videos.",2019-10-10T18:14:48Z,2020-06-30T18:27:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04792v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04792v2,"cs.IR, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV"
VideoCrafter2: Overcoming Data Limitations for High-Quality Video   Diffusion Models,"Haoxin Chen, Yong Zhang, Xiaodong Cun, Menghan Xia, Xintao Wang, Chao Weng, Ying Shan","Text-to-video generation aims to produce a video based on a given prompt. Recently, several commercial video models have been able to generate plausible videos with minimal noise, excellent details, and high aesthetic scores. However, these models rely on large-scale, well-filtered, high-quality videos that are not accessible to the community. Many existing research works, which train models using the low-quality WebVid-10M dataset, struggle to generate high-quality videos because the models are optimized to fit WebVid-10M. In this work, we explore the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion and investigate the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. We first analyze the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. We observe that full training of all modules results in a stronger coupling between spatial and temporal modules than only training temporal modules. Based on this stronger coupling, we shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation by finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quality video model. Evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, particularly in picture quality, motion, and concept composition.",2024-01-17T08:30:32Z,2024-01-17T08:30:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09047v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09047v1,cs.CV
"StreamingT2V: Consistent, Dynamic, and Extendable Long Video Generation   from Text","Roberto Henschel, Levon Khachatryan, Daniil Hayrapetyan, Hayk Poghosyan, Vahram Tadevosyan, Zhangyang Wang, Shant Navasardyan, Humphrey Shi","Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that outperforms competitors with consistency and motion.

ViLLa: Video Reasoning Segmentation with Large Language Model,"Rongkun Zheng, Lu Qi, Xi Chen, Yi Wang, Kun Wang, Yu Qiao, Hengshuang Zhao","Although video perception models have made remarkable advancements in recent years, they still heavily rely on explicit text descriptions or pre-defined categories to identify target instances before executing video perception tasks. These models, however, fail to proactively comprehend and reason the user's intentions via textual input. Even though previous works attempt to investigate solutions to incorporate reasoning with image segmentation, they fail to reason with videos due to the video's complexity in object motion. To bridge the gap between image and video, in this work, we propose a new video segmentation task - video reasoning segmentation. The task is designed to output tracklets of segmentation masks given a complex input text query. What's more, to promote research in this unexplored area, we construct a reasoning video segmentation benchmark. Finally, we present ViLLa: Video reasoning segmentation with a Large Language Model, which incorporates the language generation capabilities of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) while retaining the capabilities of detecting, segmenting, and tracking multiple instances. We use a temporal-aware context aggregation module to incorporate contextual visual cues to text embeddings and propose a video-frame decoder to build temporal correlations across segmentation tokens. Remarkably, our ViLLa demonstrates capability in handling complex reasoning and referring video segmentation. Also, our model shows impressive ability in different temporal understanding benchmarks.

A Diffusion Model Based Quality Enhancement Method for HEVC Compressed   Video,"Zheng Liu, Honggang Qi","Video post-processing methods can improve the quality of compressed videos at the decoder side. Most of the existing methods need to train corresponding models for compressed videos with different quantization parameters to improve the quality of compressed videos. However, in most cases, the quantization parameters of the decoded video are unknown. This makes existing methods have their limitations in improving video quality. To tackle this problem, this work proposes a diffusion model based post-processing method for compressed videos. The proposed method first estimates the feature vectors of the compressed video and then uses the estimated feature vectors as the prior information for the quality enhancement model to adaptively enhance the quality of compressed video with different quantization parameters.

It reduces the necessary generation time of similarly sized video diffusion models from 25 seconds to around 1 second while maintaining the same level of performance. The method's effectiveness lies in its dual-level decoupling learning approach: 1) separating the learning of video style from video generation acceleration, which allows for personalized style video generation without any personalized style video data, and 2) separating the acceleration of image generation from the acceleration of video motion generation, enhancing training efficiency and mitigating the negative effects of low-quality video data.",2024-02-01T16:58:11Z,2024-10-16T04:53:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00769v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00769v3,"cs.CV, cs.LG"
On the Computation of PSNR for a Set of Images or Video,"Onur Keleş, M. Akın Yılmaz, A. Murat Tekalp, Cansu Korkmaz, Zafer Dogan","When comparing learned image/video restoration and compression methods, it is common to report peak-signal to noise ratio (PSNR) results. However, there does not exist a generally agreed upon practice to compute PSNR for sets of images or video. Some authors report average of individual image/frame PSNR, which is equivalent to computing a single PSNR from the geometric mean of individual image/frame mean-square error (MSE). Others compute a single PSNR from the arithmetic mean of frame MSEs for each video. Furthermore, some compute the MSE/PSNR of Y-channel only, while others compute MSE/PSNR for RGB channels. This paper investigates different approaches to computing PSNR for sets of images, single video, and sets of video and the relation between them. We show the difference between computing the PSNR based on arithmetic vs. geometric mean of MSE depends on the distribution of MSE over the set of images or video, and that this distribution is task-dependent. In particular, these two methods yield larger differences in restoration problems, where the MSE is exponentially distributed and smaller differences in compression problems, where the MSE distribution is narrower. We hope this paper will motivate the community to clearly describe how they compute reported PSNR values to enable consistent comparison.",2021-04-30T09:52:07Z,2021-04-30T09:52:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14868v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14868v1,"eess.IV, cs.MM"

This work proposes low-computational cost approximations for the KLT. We focus on the blocklengths $N \in \{4, 8, 16, 32 \}$ because they are widely employed in image and video coding standards such as JPEG and high efficiency video coding (HEVC).

Watching the World Go By: Representation Learning from Unlabeled Videos,"Daniel Gordon, Kiana Ehsani, Dieter Fox, Ali Farhadi","Recent single image unsupervised representation learning techniques show remarkable success on a variety of tasks. The basic principle in these works is instance discrimination: learning to differentiate between two augmented versions of the same image and a large batch of unrelated images. Networks learn to ignore the augmentation noise and extract semantically meaningful representations. Prior work uses artificial data augmentation techniques such as cropping, and color jitter which can only affect the image in superficial ways and are not aligned with how objects actually change e.g. occlusion, deformation, viewpoint change. In this paper, we argue that videos offer this natural augmentation for free. Videos can provide entirely new views of objects, show deformation, and even connect semantically similar but visually distinct concepts. We propose Video Noise Contrastive Estimation, a method for using unlabeled video to learn strong, transferable single image representations.

HyperCUT: Video Sequence from a Single Blurry Image using Unsupervised   Ordering,"Bang-Dang Pham, Phong Tran, Anh Tran, Cuong Pham, Rang Nguyen, Minh Hoai","We consider the challenging task of training models for image-to-video deblurring, which aims to recover a sequence of sharp images corresponding to a given blurry image input. A critical issue disturbing the training of an image-to-video model is the ambiguity of the frame ordering since both the forward and backward sequences are plausible solutions. This paper proposes an effective self-supervised ordering scheme that allows training high-quality image-to-video deblurring models. Unlike previous methods that rely on order-invariant losses, we assign an explicit order for each video sequence, thus avoiding the order-ambiguity issue. Specifically, we map each video sequence to a vector in a latent high-dimensional space so that there exists a hyperplane such that for every video sequence, the vectors extracted from it and its reversed sequence are on different sides of the hyperplane. The side of the vectors will be used to define the order of the corresponding sequence. Last but not least, we propose a real-image dataset for the image-to-video deblurring problem that covers a variety of popular domains, including face, hand, and street.

Unsupervised HDR Image and Video Tone Mapping via Contrastive Learning,"Cong Cao, Huanjing Yue, Xin Liu, Jingyu Yang","Capturing high dynamic range (HDR) images (videos) is attractive because it can reveal the details in both dark and bright regions. Since the mainstream screens only support low dynamic range (LDR) content, tone mapping algorithm is required to compress the dynamic range of HDR images (videos). Although image tone mapping has been widely explored, video tone mapping is lagging behind, especially for the deep-learning-based methods, due to the lack of HDR-LDR video pairs. In this work, we propose a unified framework (IVTMNet) for unsupervised image and video tone mapping. To improve unsupervised training, we propose domain and instance based contrastive learning loss. Instead of using a universal feature extractor, such as VGG to extract the features for similarity measurement, we propose a novel latent code, which is an aggregation of the brightness and contrast of extracted features, to measure the similarity of different pairs. We totally construct two negative pairs and three positive pairs to constrain the latent codes of tone mapped results. For the network structure, we propose a spatial-feature-enhanced (SFE) module to enable information exchange and transformation of nonlocal regions. For video tone mapping, we propose a temporal-feature-replaced (TFR) module to efficiently utilize the temporal correlation and improve the temporal consistency of video tone-mapped results. We construct a large-scale unpaired HDR-LDR video dataset to facilitate the unsupervised training process for video tone mapping.

Your Image is Secretly the Last Frame of a Pseudo Video,"Wenlong Chen, Wenlin Chen, Lapo Rastrelli, Yingzhen Li","Diffusion models, which can be viewed as a special case of hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), have shown profound success in generating photo-realistic images. In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos.

Coronary Artery Segmentation in Angiographic Videos Using A 3D-2D CE-Net,"Lu Wang, Dong-xue Liang, Xiao-lei Yin, Jing Qiu, Zhi-yun Yang, Jun-hui Xing, Jian-zeng Dong, Zhao-yuan Ma","Coronary angiography is an indispensable assistive technique for cardiac interventional surgery. Segmentation and extraction of blood vessels from coronary angiography videos are very essential prerequisites for physicians to locate, assess and diagnose the plaques and stenosis in blood vessels. This article proposes a new video segmentation framework that can extract the clearest and most comprehensive coronary angiography images from a video sequence, thereby helping physicians to better observe the condition of blood vessels. This framework combines a 3D convolutional layer to extract spatial--temporal information from a video sequence and a 2D CE--Net to accomplish the segmentation task of an image sequence. The input is a few continuous frames of angiographic video, and the output is a mask of segmentation result. From the results of segmentation and extraction, we can get good segmentation results despite the poor quality of coronary angiography video sequences.",2020-03-26T11:56:17Z,2020-05-18T01:29:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11851v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11851v3,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
IOI: Invisible One-Iteration Adversarial Attack on No-Reference Image-   and Video-Quality Metrics,"Ekaterina Shumitskaya, Anastasia Antsiferova, Dmitriy Vatolin","No-reference image- and video-quality metrics are widely used in video processing benchmarks. The robustness of learning-based metrics under video attacks has not been widely studied. In addition to having success, attacks that can be employed in video processing benchmarks must be fast and imperceptible.

Bitstream-Corrupted Video Recovery: A Novel Benchmark Dataset and Method,"Tianyi Liu, Kejun Wu, Yi Wang, Wenyang Liu, Kim-Hui Yap, Lap-Pui Chau","The past decade has witnessed great strides in video recovery by specialist technologies, like video inpainting, completion, and error concealment. However, they typically simulate the missing content by manual-designed error masks, thus failing to fill in the realistic video loss in video communication (e.g., telepresence, live streaming, and internet video) and multimedia forensics. To address this, we introduce the bitstream-corrupted video (BSCV) benchmark, the first benchmark dataset with more than 28,000 video clips, which can be used for bitstream-corrupted video recovery in the real world. The BSCV is a collection of 1) a proposed three-parameter corruption model for video bitstream, 2) a large-scale dataset containing rich error patterns, multiple corruption levels, and flexible dataset branches, and 3) a plug-and-play module in video recovery framework that serves as a benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art video inpainting methods on the BSCV dataset, demonstrating existing approaches' limitations and our framework's advantages in solving the bitstream-corrupted video recovery problem.

Preserve Your Own Correlation: A Noise Prior for Video Diffusion Models,"Songwei Ge, Seungjun Nah, Guilin Liu, Tyler Poon, Andrew Tao, Bryan Catanzaro, David Jacobs, Jia-Bin Huang, Ming-Yu Liu, Yogesh Balaji","Despite tremendous progress in generating high-quality images using diffusion models, synthesizing a sequence of animated frames that are both photorealistic and temporally coherent is still in its infancy. While off-the-shelf billion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similar video data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a video diffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its image counterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusion model with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. We find that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in video diffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noise prior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimental validation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own Correlation (PYoCo), attains SOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks.

ExpressEdit: Video Editing with Natural Language and Sketching,"Bekzat Tilekbay, Saelyne Yang, Michal Lewkowicz, Alex Suryapranata, Juho Kim","Informational videos serve as a crucial source for explaining conceptual and procedural knowledge to novices and experts alike. When producing informational videos, editors edit videos by overlaying text/images or trimming footage to enhance the video quality and make it more engaging. However, video editing can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for novice video editors who often struggle with expressing and implementing their editing ideas. To address this challenge, we first explored how multimodality$-$natural language (NL) and sketching, which are natural modalities humans use for expression$-$can be utilized to support video editors in expressing video editing ideas. We gathered 176 multimodal expressions of editing commands from 10 video editors, which revealed the patterns of use of NL and sketching in describing edit intents. Based on the findings, we present ExpressEdit, a system that enables editing videos via NL text and sketching on the video frame. Powered by LLM and vision models, the system interprets (1) temporal, (2) spatial, and (3) operational references in an NL command and spatial references from sketching. The system implements the interpreted edits, which then the user can iterate on. An observational study (N=10) showed that ExpressEdit enhanced the ability of novice video editors to express and implement their edit ideas. The system allowed participants to perform edits more efficiently and generate more ideas by generating edits based on user's multimodal edit commands and supporting iterations on the editing commands.

Human-VDM: Learning Single-Image 3D Human Gaussian Splatting from Video   Diffusion Models,"Zhibin Liu, Haoye Dong, Aviral Chharia, Hefeng Wu","Generating lifelike 3D humans from a single RGB image remains a challenging task in computer vision, as it requires accurate modeling of geometry, high-quality texture, and plausible unseen parts. Existing methods typically use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video. Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images. Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality and quantity.

"Why is the video analytics accuracy fluctuating, and what can we do   about it?","Sibendu Paul, Kunal Rao, Giuseppe Coviello, Murugan Sankaradas, Oliver Po, Y. Charlie Hu, Srimat Chakradhar","It is a common practice to think of a video as a sequence of images (frames), and re-use deep neural network models that are trained only on images for similar analytics tasks on videos. In this paper, we show that this leap of faith that deep learning models that work well on images will also work well on videos is actually flawed. We show that even when a video camera is viewing a scene that is not changing in any human-perceptible way, and we control for external factors like video compression and environment (lighting), the accuracy of video analytics application fluctuates noticeably. These fluctuations occur because successive frames produced by the video camera may look similar visually, but these frames are perceived quite differently by the video analytics applications. We observed that the root cause for these fluctuations is the dynamic camera parameter changes that a video camera automatically makes in order to capture and produce a visually pleasing video. The camera inadvertently acts as an unintentional adversary because these slight changes in the image pixel values in consecutive frames, as we show, have a noticeably adverse impact on the accuracy of insights from video analytics tasks that re-use image-trained deep learning models. To address this inadvertent adversarial effect from the camera, we explore the use of transfer learning techniques to improve learning in video analytics tasks through the transfer of knowledge from learning on image analytics tasks. In particular, we show that our newly trained Yolov5 model reduces fluctuation in object detection across frames, which leads to better tracking of objects(40% fewer mistakes in tracking). Our paper also provides new directions and techniques to mitigate the camera's adversarial effect on deep learning models used for video analytics applications.",2022-08-23T23:16:24Z,2022-09-15T20:46:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12644v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12644v2,"cs.CV, cs.LG"
Pix2Video: Video Editing using Image Diffusion,"Duygu Ceylan, Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Niloy J. Mitra","Image diffusion models, trained on massive image collections, have emerged as the most versatile image generator model in terms of quality and diversity. They support inverting real images and conditional (e.g., text) generation, making them attractive for high-quality image editing applications. We investigate how to use such pre-trained image models for text-guided video editing. The critical challenge is to achieve the target edits while still preserving the content of the source video. Our method works in two simple steps: first, we use a pre-trained structure-guided (e.g., depth) image diffusion model to perform text-guided edits on an anchor frame; then, in the key step, we progressively propagate the changes to the future frames via self-attention feature injection to adapt the core denoising step of the diffusion model. We then consolidate the changes by adjusting the latent code for the frame before continuing the process. Our approach is training-free and generalizes to a wide range of edits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by extensive experimentation and compare it against four different prior and parallel efforts (on ArXiv). We demonstrate that realistic text-guided video edits are possible, without any compute-intensive preprocessing or video-specific finetuning.",2023-03-22T16:36:10Z,2023-03-22T16:36:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12688v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12688v1,cs.CV

RCLC: ROI-based joint conventional and learning video compression,"Trinh Man Hoang, Jinjia Zhou","COVID-19 leads to the high demand for remote interactive systems ever seen. One of the key elements of these systems is video streaming, which requires a very high network bandwidth due to its specific real-time demand, especially with high-resolution video. Existing video compression methods are struggling in the trade-off between video quality and the speed requirement. Addressed that the background information rarely changes in most remote meeting cases, we introduce a Region-Of-Interests (ROI) based video compression framework (named RCLC) that leverages the cutting-edge learning-based and conventional technologies. In RCLC, each coming frame is marked as a background-updating (BU) or ROI-updating (RU) frame. By applying the conventional video codec, the BU frame is compressed with low-quality and high-compression, while the ROI from RU-frame is compressed with high-quality and low-compression. The learning-based methods are applied to detect the ROI, blend background-ROI, and enhance video quality. The experimental results show that our RCLC can reduce up to 32.55\% BD-rate for the ROI region compared to H.265 video codec under a similar compression time with 1080p resolution.",2021-07-14T05:38:37Z,2021-07-14T05:38:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06492v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06492v1,"cs.MM, cs.CV, eess.IV"
Bit-depth enhancement detection for compressed video,"Nickolay Safonov, Dmitriy Vatolin","In recent years, display intensity and contrast have increased considerably. Many displays support high dynamic range (HDR) and 10-bit color depth. Since high bit-depth is an emerging technology, video content is still largely shot and transmitted with a bit depth of 8 bits or less per color component. Insufficient bit-depths produce distortions called false contours or banding, and they are visible on high contrast screens. To deal with such distortions, researchers have proposed algorithms for bit-depth enhancement (dequantization). Such techniques convert videos with low bit-depth (LBD) to videos with high bit-depth (HBD). The quality of converted LBD video, however, is usually lower than that of the original HBD video, and many consumers prefer to keep the original HBD versions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to determine whether a video has undergone conversion before compression. This problem is complex; it involves detecting outcomes of different dequantization algorithms in the presence of compression that strongly affects the least-significant bits (LSBs) in the video frames. Our algorithm can detect bit-depth enhancement and demonstrates good generalization capability, as it is able to determine whether a video has undergone processing by dequantization algorithms absent from the training dataset.",2022-11-09T10:46:34Z,2022-11-09T10:46:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04799v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04799v1,"cs.CV, cs.GR, eess.IV"

DarkVision: A Benchmark for Low-light Image/Video Perception,"Bo Zhang, Yuchen Guo, Runzhao Yang, Zhihong Zhang, Jiayi Xie, Jinli Suo, Qionghai Dai","Imaging and perception in photon-limited scenarios is necessary for various applications, e.g., night surveillance or photography, high-speed photography, and autonomous driving. In these cases, cameras suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio, which degrades the image quality severely and poses challenges for downstream high-level vision tasks like object detection and recognition. Data-driven methods have achieved enormous success in both image restoration and high-level vision tasks. However, the lack of high-quality benchmark dataset with task-specific accurate annotations for photon-limited images/videos delays the research progress heavily. In this paper, we contribute the first multi-illuminance, multi-camera, and low-light dataset, named DarkVision, serving for both image enhancement and object detection. We provide bright and dark pairs with pixel-wise registration, in which the bright counterpart provides reliable reference for restoration and annotation. The dataset consists of bright-dark pairs of 900 static scenes with objects from 15 categories, and 32 dynamic scenes with 4-category objects. For each scene, images/videos were captured at 5 illuminance levels using three cameras of different grades, and average photons can be reliably estimated from the calibration data for quantitative studies. The static-scene images and dynamic videos respectively contain around 7,344 and 320,667 instances in total. With DarkVision, we established baselines for image/video enhancement and object detection by representative algorithms.

Learned Scalable Video Coding For Humans and Machines,"Hadi Hadizadeh, Ivan V. Bajić","Video coding has traditionally been developed to support services such as video streaming, videoconferencing, digital TV, and so on. The main intent was to enable human viewing of the encoded content. However, with the advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), encoded video is increasingly being used for automatic video analytics performed by machines. In applications such as automatic traffic monitoring, analytics such as vehicle detection, tracking and counting, would run continuously, while human viewing could be required occasionally to review potential incidents. To support such applications, a new paradigm for video coding is needed that will facilitate efficient representation and compression of video for both machine and human use in a scalable manner. In this manuscript, we introduce an end-to-end learnable video codec that supports a machine vision task in its base layer, while its enhancement layer, together with the base layer, supports input reconstruction for human viewing. The proposed system is constructed based on the concept of conditional coding to achieve better compression gains. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on four standard video datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms both state-of-the-art learned and conventional video codecs in its base layer, while maintaining comparable performance on the human vision task in its enhancement layer.

Efficient Video Diffusion Models via Content-Frame Motion-Latent   Decomposition,"Sihyun Yu, Weili Nie, De-An Huang, Boyi Li, Jinwoo Shin, Anima Anandkumar","Video diffusion models have recently made great progress in generation quality, but are still limited by the high memory and computational requirements. This is because current video diffusion models often attempt to process high-dimensional videos directly. To tackle this issue, we propose content-motion latent diffusion model (CMD), a novel efficient extension of pretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of a content frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latent representation. The former represents the common content, and the latter represents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate the content frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and we generate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweight diffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent space that can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has not been done in previous latent video diffusion models. This leads to considerably better quality generation and reduced computational costs. For instance, CMD can sample a video 7.7$\times$ faster than prior approaches by generating a video of 512$\times$1024 resolution and length 16 in 3.1 seconds. Moreover, CMD achieves an FVD score of 212.7 on WebVid-10M, 27.3% better than the previous state-of-the-art of 292.4.",2024-03-21T05:48:48Z,2024-03-21T05:48:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14148v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14148v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG"

Yet, most work has been focused on detecting anomalous frames in surveillance videos taken from security cameras. Meanwhile, the task of anomaly detection (AD) in videos exhibiting anomalous mechanical behavior, has been mostly overlooked. Anomaly detection in such videos is both of academic and practical interest, as they may enable automatic detection of malfunctions in many manufacturing, maintenance, and real-life settings. To assess the potential of the different approaches to detect such anomalies, we evaluate two simple baseline approaches: (i) Temporal-pooled image AD techniques. (ii) Density estimation of videos represented with features pretrained for video-classification.   Development of such methods calls for new benchmarks to allow evaluation of different possible approaches. We introduce the Physical Anomalous Trajectory or Motion (PHANTOM) dataset, which contains six different video classes. Each class consists of normal and anomalous videos. The classes differ in the presented phenomena, the normal class variability, and the kind of anomalies in the videos. We also suggest an even harder benchmark where anomalous activities should be spotted on highly variable scenes.",2021-12-14T18:57:44Z,2021-12-14T18:57:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07661v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07661v1,cs.CV
Nearest-Neighbor Inter-Intra Contrastive Learning from Unlabeled Videos,"David Fan, Deyu Yang, Xinyu Li, Vimal Bhat, Rohith MV","Contrastive learning has recently narrowed the gap between self-supervised and supervised methods in image and video domain. State-of-the-art video contrastive learning methods such as CVRL and $\rho$-MoCo spatiotemporally augment two clips from the same video as positives. By only sampling positive clips locally from a single video, these methods neglect other semantically related videos that can also be useful. To address this limitation, we leverage nearest-neighbor videos from the global space as additional positive pairs, thus improving positive key diversity and introducing a more relaxed notion of similarity that extends beyond video and even class boundaries.

EffiVED:Efficient Video Editing via Text-instruction Diffusion Models,"Zhenghao Zhang, Zuozhuo Dai, Long Qin, Weizhi Wang","Large-scale text-to-video models have shown remarkable abilities, but their direct application in video editing remains challenging due to limited available datasets. Current video editing methods commonly require per-video fine-tuning of diffusion models or specific inversion optimization to ensure high-fidelity edits. In this paper, we introduce EffiVED, an efficient diffusion-based model that directly supports instruction-guided video editing. To achieve this, we present two efficient workflows to gather video editing pairs, utilizing augmentation and fundamental vision-language techniques. These workflows transform vast image editing datasets and open-world videos into a high-quality dataset for training EffiVED. Experimental results reveal that EffiVED not only generates high-quality editing videos but also executes rapidly.

However, existing video-language models often overlook precise temporal localization and struggle with videos of varying lengths. We introduce TimeMarker, a versatile Video-LLM designed for high-quality dialogue based on video content, emphasizing temporal localization. TimeMarker integrates Temporal Separator Tokens to enhance temporal awareness, accurately marking specific moments within videos. It employs the AnyLength mechanism for dynamic frame sampling and adaptive token merging, enabling effective handling of both short and long videos. Additionally, TimeMarker utilizes diverse datasets, including further transformed temporal-related video QA datasets, to bolster its temporal understanding capabilities.

Unlearning Concepts from Text-to-Video Diffusion Models,"Shiqi Liu, Yihua Tan","With the advancement of computer vision and natural language processing, text-to-video generation, enabled by text-to-video diffusion models, has become more prevalent. These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.",2024-07-19T11:15:02Z,2024-07-19T11:15:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14209v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14209v1,"cs.LG, cs.CV"
Image Conditioned Keyframe-Based Video Summarization Using Object   Detection,"Neeraj Baghel, Suresh C. Raikwar, Charul Bhatnagar","Video summarization plays an important role in selecting keyframe for understanding a video. Traditionally, it aims to find the most representative and diverse contents (or frames) in a video for short summaries. Recently, query-conditioned video summarization has been introduced, which considers user queries to learn more user-oriented summaries and its preference. However, there are obstacles in text queries for user subjectivity and finding similarity between the user query and input frames. In this work, (i) Image is introduced as a query for user preference (ii) a mathematical model is proposed to minimize redundancy based on the loss function & summary variance and (iii) the similarity score between the query image and input video to obtain the summarized video. Furthermore, the Object-based Query Image (OQI) dataset has been introduced, which contains the query images. The proposed method has been validated using UT Egocentric (UTE) dataset. The proposed model successfully resolved the issues of (i) user preference, (ii) recognize important frames and selecting that keyframe in daily life videos, with different illumination conditions. The proposed method achieved 57.06% average F1-Score for UTE dataset and outperforms the existing state-of-theart by 11.01%.

OmniTokenizer: A Joint Image-Video Tokenizer for Visual Generation,"Junke Wang, Yi Jiang, Zehuan Yuan, Binyue Peng, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang","Tokenizer, serving as a translator to map the intricate visual data into a compact latent space, lies at the core of visual generative models. Based on the finding that existing tokenizers are tailored to image or video inputs, this paper presents OmniTokenizer, a transformer-based tokenizer for joint image and video tokenization. OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by 13% and 26%, respectively.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Face Recognition in Unlabeled Videos,"Kihyuk Sohn, Sifei Liu, Guangyu Zhong, Xiang Yu, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Manmohan Chandraker","Despite rapid advances in face recognition, there remains a clear gap between the performance of still image-based face recognition and video-based face recognition, due to the vast difference in visual quality between the domains and the difficulty of curating diverse large-scale video datasets. This paper addresses both of those challenges, through an image to video feature-level domain adaptation approach, to learn discriminative video frame representations. The framework utilizes large-scale unlabeled video data to reduce the gap between different domains while transferring discriminative knowledge from large-scale labeled still images. Given a face recognition network that is pretrained in the image domain, the adaptation is achieved by (i) distilling knowledge from the network to a video adaptation network through feature matching, (ii) performing feature restoration through synthetic data augmentation and (iii) learning a domain-invariant feature through a domain adversarial discriminator. We further improve performance through a discriminator-guided feature fusion that boosts high-quality frames while eliminating those degraded by video domain-specific factors. Experiments on the YouTube Faces and IJB-A datasets demonstrate that each module contributes to our feature-level domain adaptation framework and substantially improves video face recognition performance to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. We demonstrate qualitatively that the network learns to suppress diverse artifacts in videos such as pose, illumination or occlusion without being explicitly trained for them.",2017-08-07T16:36:54Z,2017-08-07T16:36:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02191v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02191v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
Prompt Switch: Efficient CLIP Adaptation for Text-Video Retrieval,"Chaorui Deng, Qi Chen, Pengda Qin, Da Chen, Qi Wu","In text-video retrieval, recent works have benefited from the powerful learning capabilities of pre-trained text-image foundation models (e.g., CLIP) by adapting them to the video domain. A critical problem for them is how to effectively capture the rich semantics inside the video using the image encoder of CLIP. To tackle this, state-of-the-art methods adopt complex cross-modal modeling techniques to fuse the text information into video frame representations, which, however, incurs severe efficiency issues in large-scale retrieval systems as the video representations must be recomputed online for every text query. In this paper, we discard this problematic cross-modal fusion process and aim to learn semantically-enhanced representations purely from the video, so that the video representations can be computed offline and reused for different texts. Concretely, we first introduce a spatial-temporal ""Prompt Cube"" into the CLIP image encoder and iteratively switch it within the encoder layers to efficiently incorporate the global video semantics into frame representations. We then propose to apply an auxiliary video captioning objective to train the frame representations, which facilitates the learning of detailed video semantics by providing fine-grained guidance in the semantic space. With a naive temporal fusion strategy (i.e., mean-pooling) on the enhanced frame representations, we obtain state-of-the-art performances on three benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, and LSMDC.",2023-08-15T08:54:25Z,2023-08-15T08:54:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07648v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07648v1,cs.CV
Detection of (Hidden) Emotions from Videos using Muscles Movements and   Face Manifold Embedding,"Juni Kim, Zhikang Dong, Eric Guan, Judah Rosenthal, Shi Fu, Miriam Rafailovich, Pawel Polak","We provide a new non-invasive, easy-to-scale for large amounts of subjects and a remotely accessible method for (hidden) emotion detection from videos of human faces. Our approach combines face manifold detection for accurate location of the face in the video with local face manifold embedding to create a common domain for the measurements of muscle micro-movements that is invariant to the movement of the subject in the video. In the next step, we employ the Digital Image Speckle Correlation (DISC) and the optical flow algorithm to compute the pattern of micro-movements in the face. The corresponding vector field is mapped back to the original space and superimposed on the original frames of the videos. Hence, the resulting videos include additional information about the direction of the movement of the muscles in the face. We take the publicly available CK++ dataset of visible emotions and add to it videos of the same format but with hidden emotions. We process all the videos using our micro-movement detection and use the results to train a state-of-the-art network for emotions classification from videos -- Frame Attention Network (FAN). Although the original FAN model achieves very high out-of-sample performance on the original CK++ videos, it does not perform so well on hidden emotions videos. The performance improves significantly when the model is trained and tested on videos with the vector fields of muscle movements. Intuitively, the corresponding arrows serve as edges in the image that are easily captured by the convolutions filters in the FAN network.",2022-11-01T02:48:35Z,2022-11-01T02:48:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00233v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00233v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, I.4.3; I.4.9"
Rate-Perception Optimized Preprocessing for Video Coding,"Chengqian Ma, Zhiqiang Wu, Chunlei Cai, Pengwei Zhang, Yi Wang, Long Zheng, Chao Chen, Quan Zhou","In the past decades, lots of progress have been done in the video compression field including traditional video codec and learning-based video codec. However, few studies focus on using preprocessing techniques to improve the rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose a rate-perception optimized preprocessing (RPP) method. We first introduce an adaptive Discrete Cosine Transform loss function which can save the bitrate and keep essential high frequency components as well. Furthermore, we also combine several state-of-the-art techniques from low-level vision fields into our approach, such as the high-order degradation model, efficient lightweight network design, and Image Quality Assessment model. By jointly using these powerful techniques, our RPP approach can achieve on average, 16.27% bitrate saving with different video encoders like AVC, HEVC, and VVC under multiple quality metrics. In the deployment stage, our RPP method is very simple and efficient which is not required any changes in the setting of video encoding, streaming, and decoding. Each input frame only needs to make a single pass through RPP before sending into video encoders. In addition, in our subjective visual quality test, 87% of users think videos with RPP are better or equal to videos by only using the codec to compress, while these videos with RPP save about 12% bitrate on average. Our RPP framework has been integrated into the production environment of our video transcoding services which serve millions of users every day.",2023-01-25T08:21:52Z,2023-01-25T08:21:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10455v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10455v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.MM"
A Recipe for Scaling up Text-to-Video Generation with Text-free Videos,"Xiang Wang, Shiwei Zhang, Hangjie Yuan, Zhiwu Qing, Biao Gong, Yingya Zhang, Yujun Shen, Changxin Gao, Nong Sang","Diffusion-based text-to-video generation has witnessed impressive progress in the past year yet still falls behind text-to-image generation. One of the key reasons is the limited scale of publicly available data (e.g., 10M video-text pairs in WebVid10M vs. 5B image-text pairs in LAION), considering the high cost of video captioning. Instead, it could be far easier to collect unlabeled clips from video platforms like YouTube. Motivated by this, we come up with a novel text-to-video generation framework, termed TF-T2V, which can directly learn with text-free videos. The rationale behind is to separate the process of text decoding from that of temporal modeling. To this end, we employ a content branch and a motion branch, which are jointly optimized with weights shared. Following such a pipeline, we study the effect of doubling the scale of training set (i.e., video-only WebVid10M) with some randomly collected text-free videos and are encouraged to observe the performance improvement (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441), demonstrating the scalability of our approach. We also find that our model could enjoy sustainable performance gain (FID from 8.19 to 7.64 and FVD from 441 to 366) after reintroducing some text labels for training.

Unlike previous works that rely solely on image generative models to colorize lineart frame by frame, our approach leverages a large-scale pretrained video diffusion model to generate colorized animation videos. This approach leads to more temporally consistent results and is better equipped to handle large motions. Firstly, we introduce Sketch-guided ControlNet which provides additional control to finetune an image-to-video diffusion model for controllable video synthesis, enabling the generation of animation videos conditioned on lineart. We then propose Reference Attention to facilitate the transfer of colors from the reference frame to other frames containing fast and expansive motions. Finally, we present a novel scheme for sequential sampling, incorporating the Overlapped Blending Module and Prev-Reference Attention, to extend the video diffusion model beyond its original fixed-length limitation for long video colorization. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of frame and video quality, as well as temporal consistency.

Recent advancements in enhancing the video diffusion model (VDM) through feedback learning have shown promising results. However, these methods still exhibit notable limitations, such as misaligned feedback and inferior scalability. To tackle these issues, we introduce OnlineVPO, a more efficient preference learning approach tailored specifically for video diffusion models. Our method features two novel designs, firstly, instead of directly using image-based reward feedback, we leverage the video quality assessment (VQA) model trained on synthetic data as the reward model to provide distribution and modality-aligned feedback on the video diffusion model. Additionally, we introduce an online DPO algorithm to address the off-policy optimization and scalability issue in existing video preference learning frameworks. By employing the video reward model to offer concise video feedback on the fly, OnlineVPO offers effective and efficient preference guidance.

This hinders the progress towards advanced video architectures. This paper presents an in-depth study of using large volumes of web videos for pre-training video models for the task of action recognition. Our primary empirical finding is that pre-training at a very large scale (over 65 million videos), despite on noisy social-media videos and hashtags, substantially improves the state-of-the-art on three challenging public action recognition datasets. Further, we examine three questions in the construction of weakly-supervised video action datasets. First, given that actions involve interactions with objects, how should one construct a verb-object pre-training label space to benefit transfer learning the most? Second, frame-based models perform quite well on action recognition; is pre-training for good image features sufficient or is pre-training for spatio-temporal features valuable for optimal transfer learning?

Progressive Growing of Video Tokenizers for Highly Compressed Latent   Spaces,"Aniruddha Mahapatra, Long Mai, Yitian Zhang, David Bourgin, Feng Liu","Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to direct extensions of existing video tokenizers.

Learning Blind Video Temporal Consistency,"Wei-Sheng Lai, Jia-Bin Huang, Oliver Wang, Eli Shechtman, Ersin Yumer, Ming-Hsuan Yang","Applying image processing algorithms independently to each frame of a video often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. Developing temporally consistent video-based extensions, however, requires domain knowledge for individual tasks and is unable to generalize to other applications. In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end approach based on deep recurrent network for enforcing temporal consistency in a video. Our method takes the original unprocessed and per-frame processed videos as inputs to produce a temporally consistent video. Consequently, our approach is agnostic to specific image processing algorithms applied on the original video. We train the proposed network by minimizing both short-term and long-term temporal losses as well as the perceptual loss to strike a balance between temporal stability and perceptual similarity with the processed frames. At test time, our model does not require computing optical flow and thus achieves real-time speed even for high-resolution videos. We show that our single model can handle multiple and unseen tasks, including but not limited to artistic style transfer, enhancement, colorization, image-to-image translation and intrinsic image decomposition.

Stereo image de-fencing using smartphones,"Sankaraganesh Jonna, Sukla Satapathy, Rajiv R.

In this work, we present a method to harness disparity using a stereo pair of fenced images in order to detect fence pixels. Tourists and amateur photographers commonly carry smartphones/phablets which can be used to capture a short video sequence of the fenced scene. We model the formation of the occluded frames in the captured video.

Recently, 3D CNN-based models dominate the field of magnetic resonance image (MRI) analytics. Due to the high similarity between MRI data and videos, we conduct extensive empirical studies on video recognition techniques for MRI classification to answer the questions: (1) can we directly use video recognition models for MRI classification, (2) which model is more appropriate for MRI, (3) are the common tricks like data augmentation in video recognition still useful for MRI classification? Our work suggests that advanced video techniques benefit MRI classification. In this paper, four datasets of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease recognition are utilized in experiments, together with three alternative video recognition models and data augmentation techniques that are frequently applied to video tasks. In terms of efficiency, the results reveal that the video framework performs better than 3D-CNN models by 5% - 11% with 50% - 66% less trainable parameters.

Variational local structure estimation for image super-resolution,Heng Lian,"Super-resolution is an important but difficult problem in image/video processing. If a video sequence or some training set other than the given low-resolution image is available, this kind of extra information can greatly aid in the reconstruction of the high-resolution image. The problem is substantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand. The image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is insufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to oversmooth images with essentially no noise. We propose a new adaptive linear interpolation method based on variational method and inspired by local linear embedding (LLE). The experimental result shows that our method avoids the problem of oversmoothing and preserves image structures well.",2007-09-12T08:41:36Z,2007-09-12T08:41:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.1771v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1771v1,cs.CV
GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation,"Shrisha Bharadwaj, Haiwen Feng, Victoria Abrevaya, Michael J. Black","Manipulating the illumination within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has been traditionally addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which require explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be practical and possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on massive amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we explore the potential of exploiting video diffusion models, and in particular Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), in understanding the physical world to perform relighting tasks given a single image. Specifically, we introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate the results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset (270 objects) is able to generalize to real images, enabling single-image relighting with realistic ray tracing effects and cast shadows. These results reveal the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape. Our findings suggest that such models, with minimal training, can be used for physically-based rendering without explicit physically asset reconstruction and complex ray tracing. This further suggests the potential of such models for controllable and physically accurate image synthesis tasks.",2024-12-15T15:40:40Z,2024-12-15T15:40:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11224v1,"cs.CV, cs.GR"
Grounded Video Description,"Luowei Zhou, Yannis Kalantidis, Xinlei Chen, Jason J. Corso, Marcus Rohrbach","Video description is one of the most challenging problems in vision and language understanding due to the large variability both on the video and language side. Models, hence, typically shortcut the difficulty in recognition and generate plausible sentences that are based on priors but are not necessarily grounded in the video. In this work, we explicitly link the sentence to the evidence in the video by annotating each noun phrase in a sentence with the corresponding bounding box in one of the frames of a video. Our dataset, ActivityNet-Entities, augments the challenging ActivityNet Captions dataset with 158k bounding box annotations, each grounding a noun phrase. This allows training video description models with this data, and importantly, evaluate how grounded or ""true"" such model are to the video they describe. To generate grounded captions, we propose a novel video description model which is able to exploit these bounding box annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on our dataset, but also show how it can be applied to image description on the Flickr30k Entities dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on video description, video paragraph description, and image description and demonstrate our generated sentences are better grounded in the video.",2018-12-17T02:46:17Z,2019-05-05T19:52:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06587v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06587v2,cs.CV
CLIPVQA:Video Quality Assessment via CLIP,"Fengchuang Xing, Mingjie Li, Yuan-Gen Wang, Guopu Zhu, Xiaochun Cao","In learning vision-language representations from web-scale data, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) mechanism has demonstrated a remarkable performance in many vision tasks. However, its application to the widely studied video quality assessment (VQA) task is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective CLIP-based Transformer method for the VQA problem (CLIPVQA). Specifically, we first design an effective video frame perception paradigm with the goal of extracting the rich spatiotemporal quality and content information among video frames. Then, the spatiotemporal quality features are adequately integrated together using a self-attention mechanism to yield video-level quality representation. To utilize the quality language descriptions of videos for supervision, we develop a CLIP-based encoder for language embedding, which is then fully aggregated with the generated content information via a cross-attention module for producing video-language representation. Finally, the video-level quality and video-language representations are fused together for final video quality prediction, where a vectorized regression loss is employed for efficient end-to-end optimization. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on eight in-the-wild video datasets with diverse resolutions to evaluate the performance of CLIPVQA. The experimental results show that the proposed CLIPVQA achieves new state-of-the-art VQA performance and up to 37% better generalizability than existing benchmark VQA methods. A series of ablation studies are also performed to validate the effectiveness of each module in CLIPVQA.",2024-07-06T02:32:28Z,2024-07-06T02:32:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04928v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04928v1,"cs.CV, eess.IV"
Dormant: Defending against Pose-driven Human Image Animation,"Jiachen Zhou, Mingsi Wang, Tianlin Li, Guozhu Meng, Kai Chen","Pose-driven human image animation has achieved tremendous progress, enabling the generation of vivid and realistic human videos from just one single photo. However, it conversely exacerbates the risk of image misuse, as attackers may use one available image to create videos involving politics, violence, and other illegal content. To counter this threat, we propose Dormant, a novel protection approach tailored to defend against pose-driven human image animation techniques. Dormant applies protective perturbation to one human image, preserving the visual similarity to the original but resulting in poor-quality video generation. The protective perturbation is optimized to induce misextraction of appearance features from the image and create incoherence among the generated video frames. Our extensive evaluation across 8 animation methods and 4 datasets demonstrates the superiority of Dormant over 6 baseline protection methods, leading to misaligned identities, visual distortions, noticeable artifacts, and inconsistent frames in the generated videos. Moreover, Dormant shows effectiveness on 6 real-world commercial services, even with fully black-box access.",2024-09-22T12:51:32Z,2025-02-24T08:35:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14424v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14424v2,"cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.CV"

In this paper, we study the problem of video question answering by modeling its temporal dynamics with frame-level attention mechanism. We propose the attribute-augmented attention network learning framework that enables the joint frame-level attribute detection and unified video representation learning for video question answering.

Network state Estimation using Raw Video Analysis: vQoS-GAN based   non-intrusive Deep Learning Approach,"Renith G, Harikrishna Warrier, Yogesh Gupta","Content based providers transmits real time complex signal such as video data from one region to another. During this transmission process, the signals usually end up distorted or degraded where the actual information present in the video is lost. This normally happens in the streaming video services applications. Hence there is a need to know the level of degradation that happened in the receiver side. This video degradation can be estimated by network state parameters like data rate and packet loss values. Our proposed solution vQoS GAN (video Quality of Service Generative Adversarial Network) can estimate the network state parameters from the degraded received video data using a deep learning approach of semi supervised generative adversarial network algorithm.

Motion Capture from Internet Videos,"Junting Dong, Qing Shuai, Yuanqing Zhang, Xian Liu, Xiaowei Zhou, Hujun Bao","Recent advances in image-based human pose estimation make it possible to capture 3D human motion from a single RGB video. However, the inherent depth ambiguity and self-occlusion in a single view prohibit the recovery of as high-quality motion as multi-view reconstruction. While multi-view videos are not common, the videos of a celebrity performing a specific action are usually abundant on the Internet. Even if these videos were recorded at different time instances, they would encode the same motion characteristics of the person. Therefore, we propose to capture human motion by jointly analyzing these Internet videos instead of using single videos separately. However, this new task poses many new challenges that cannot be addressed by existing methods, as the videos are unsynchronized, the camera viewpoints are unknown, the background scenes are different, and the human motions are not exactly the same among videos. To address these challenges, we propose a novel optimization-based framework and experimentally demonstrate its ability to recover much more precise and detailed motion from multiple videos, compared against monocular motion capture methods.",2020-08-18T13:48:37Z,2020-08-19T02:56:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07931v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07931v2,cs.CV

Placing the same actions from different videos near each other in the two-dimensional space based on feature similarity helps the annotator to group-label video clips. We evaluate our method on two subsets of the ActivityNet (v1.3) and a subset of the Sports-1M dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel motion plane adaptive motion modeling technique (MPA) for spherical video that allows to perform motion compensation on different motion planes in 3D space instead of having to work on the - in theory arbitrarily mapped - 2D image representation directly.

In this paper, we propose an elegant yet effective Temporal-Consistent Video Editing (TCVE) method to mitigate the temporal inconsistency challenge for robust text-guided video editing. In addition to the utilization of a pretrained T2I 2D Unet for spatial content manipulation, we establish a dedicated temporal Unet architecture to faithfully capture the temporal coherence of the input video sequences. Furthermore, to establish coherence and interrelation between the spatial-focused and temporal-focused components, a cohesive spatial-temporal modeling unit is formulated. This unit effectively interconnects the temporal Unet with the pretrained 2D Unet, thereby enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos while preserving the capacity for video content manipulation.

Quality Prediction of AI Generated Images and Videos: Emerging Trends   and Opportunities,"Abhijay Ghildyal, Yuanhan Chen, Saman Zadtootaghaj, Nabajeet Barman, Alan C.

AI-based methods for image and video super resolution, video frame interpolation, denoising, and compression have already gathered significant attention and interest in the industry and some solutions are already being implemented in real-world products and services. However, to achieve widespread integration and acceptance, AI-generated and enhanced content must be visually accurate, adhere to intended use, and maintain high visual quality to avoid degrading the end user's quality of experience (QoE).   One way to monitor and control the visual ""quality"" of AI-generated and -enhanced content is by deploying Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models. However, most existing IQA and VQA models measure visual fidelity in terms of ""reconstruction"" quality against a pristine reference content and were not designed to assess the quality of ""generative"" artifacts. To address this, newer metrics and models have recently been proposed, but their performance evaluation and overall efficacy have been limited by datasets that were too small or otherwise lack representative content and/or distortion capacity; and by performance measures that can accurately report the success of an IQA/VQA model for ""GenAI"". This paper examines the current shortcomings and possibilities presented by AI-generated and enhanced image and video content, with a particular focus on end-user perceived quality.

Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli,"Jacob Yeung, Andrew F. Luo, Gabriel Sarch, Margaret M. Henderson, Deva Ramanan, Michael J.

This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. This framework advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes.

SPECTRUM: Semantic Processing and Emotion-informed video-Captioning   Through Retrieval and Understanding Modalities,"Ehsan Faghihi, Mohammedreza Zarenejad, Ali-Asghar Beheshti Shirazi","Capturing a video's meaning and critical concepts by analyzing the subtle details is a fundamental yet challenging task in video captioning. Identifying the dominant emotional tone in a video significantly enhances the perception of its context. Despite a strong emphasis on video captioning, existing models often need to adequately address emotional themes, resulting in suboptimal captioning results. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Processing and Emotion-informed video-Captioning Through Retrieval and Understanding Modalities (SPECTRUM) framework to empower the generation of emotionally and semantically credible captions. Leveraging our pioneering structure, SPECTRUM discerns multimodal semantics and emotional themes using Visual Text Attribute Investigation (VTAI) and determines the orientation of descriptive captions through a Holistic Concept-Oriented Theme (HCOT), expressing emotionally-informed and field-acquainted references. They exploit video-to-text retrieval capabilities and the multifaceted nature of video content to estimate the emotional probabilities of candidate captions. Then, the dominant theme of the video is determined by appropriately weighting embedded attribute vectors and applying coarse- and fine-grained emotional concepts, which define the video's contextual alignment. Furthermore, using two loss functions, SPECTRUM is optimized to integrate emotional information and minimize prediction errors. Extensive experiments on the EmVidCap, MSVD, and MSRVTT video captioning datasets demonstrate that our model significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Large-Scale Study of Perceptual Video Quality,"Zeina Sinno, Alan C. Bovik","The great variations of videographic skills, camera designs, compression and processing protocols, and displays lead to an enormous variety of video impairments. Current no-reference (NR) video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, often commingled distortions that are impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often perform poorly. Towards advancing NR video quality prediction, we constructed a large-scale video quality assessment database containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users, with wide ranges of levels of complex, authentic distortions. We collected a large number of subjective video quality scores via crowdsourcing. A total of 4776 unique participants took part in the study, yielding more than 205000 opinion scores, resulting in an average of 240 recorded human opinions per video. We demonstrate the value of the new resource, which we call the LIVE Video Quality Challenge Database (LIVE-VQC), by conducting a comparison of leading NR video quality predictors on it.

Skeleton Boxes: Solving skeleton based action detection with a single   deep convolutional neural network,"Bo Li, Huahui Chen, Yucheng Chen, Yuchao Dai, Mingyi He","Action recognition from well-segmented 3D skeleton video has been intensively studied. However, due to the difficulty in representing the 3D skeleton video and the lack of training data, action detection from streaming 3D skeleton video still lags far behind its recognition counterpart and image based object detection. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for this problem, which leverages both effective skeleton video encoding and deep regression based object detection from images. Our framework consists of two parts: skeleton-based video image mapping, which encodes a skeleton video to a color image in a temporal preserving way, and an end-to-end trainable fast skeleton action detector (Skeleton Boxes) based on image detection. Experimental results on the latest and largest PKU-MMD benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. We believe our idea would inspire and benefit future research in this important area.",2017-04-19T08:16:13Z,2017-04-19T08:16:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05643v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05643v1,cs.CV
Mitigation of H.264 and H.265 Video Compression for Reliable PRNU   Estimation,"Enes Altınışık, Kasım Taşdemir, Hüsrev Taha Sencar","The photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) is a distinctive image sensor characteristic, and an imaging device inadvertently introduces its sensor's PRNU into all media it captures. Therefore, the PRNU can be regarded as a camera fingerprint and used for source attribution. The imaging pipeline in a camera, however, involves various processing steps that are detrimental to PRNU estimation. In the context of photographic images, these challenges are successfully addressed and the method for estimating a sensor's PRNU pattern is well established. However, various additional challenges related to generation of videos remain largely untackled. With this perspective, this work introduces methods to mitigate disruptive effects of widely deployed H.264 and H.265 video compression standards on PRNU estimation. Our approach involves an intervention in the decoding process to eliminate a filtering procedure applied at the decoder to reduce blockiness. It also utilizes decoding parameters to develop a weighting scheme and adjust the contribution of video frames at the macroblock level to PRNU estimation process. Results obtained on videos captured by 28 cameras show that our approach increases the PRNU matching metric up to more than five times over the conventional estimation method tailored for photos.",2019-05-23T12:12:14Z,2019-05-23T12:12:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09611v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09611v1,eess.IV

Given an image and a sequence of human body poses, our method synthesizes a video containing both human and fabric motion. To achieve this, we transform a pretrained text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) into a pose-and-image guided video synthesis model, using a novel fine-tuning strategy, a set of architectural changes to support the added conditioning signals, and techniques to encourage temporal consistency.

Video Contrastive Learning with Global Context,"Haofei Kuang, Yi Zhu, Zhi Zhang, Xinyu Li, Joseph Tighe, Sören Schwertfeger, Cyrill Stachniss, Mu Li","Contrastive learning has revolutionized self-supervised image representation learning field, and recently been adapted to video domain. One of the greatest advantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define powerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate positive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely heavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level contrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this paper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on segments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global context in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate a temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential structure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level contrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous state-of-the-arts on five video datasets for downstream action classification, action localization and video retrieval.

Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks Against Video Anomaly Detection   Systems,"Furkan Mumcu, Keval Doshi, Yasin Yilmaz","Anomaly detection in videos is an important computer vision problem with various applications including automated video surveillance. Although adversarial attacks on image understanding models have been heavily investigated, there is not much work on adversarial machine learning targeting video understanding models and no previous work which focuses on video anomaly detection. To this end, we investigate an adversarial machine learning attack against video anomaly detection systems, that can be implemented via an easy-to-perform cyber-attack. Since surveillance cameras are usually connected to the server running the anomaly detection model through a wireless network, they are prone to cyber-attacks targeting the wireless connection. We demonstrate how Wi-Fi deauthentication attack, a notoriously easy-to-perform and effective denial-of-service (DoS) attack, can be utilized to generate adversarial data for video anomaly detection systems. Specifically, we apply several effects caused by the Wi-Fi deauthentication attack on video quality (e.g., slow down, freeze, fast forward, low resolution) to the popular benchmark datasets for video anomaly detection. Our experiments with several state-of-the-art anomaly detection models show that the attackers can significantly undermine the reliability of video anomaly detection systems by causing frequent false alarms and hiding physical anomalies from the surveillance system.",2022-04-07T00:57:50Z,2022-04-07T00:57:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03141v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03141v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"
Learning Cross-Video Neural Representations for High-Quality Frame   Interpolation,"Wentao Shangguan, Yu Sun, Weijie Gan, Ulugbek S. Kamilov","This paper considers the problem of temporal video interpolation, where the goal is to synthesize a new video frame given its two neighbors. We propose Cross-Video Neural Representation (CURE) as the first video interpolation method based on neural fields (NF). NF refers to the recent class of methods for the neural representation of complex 3D scenes that has seen widespread success and application across computer vision. CURE represents the video as a continuous function parameterized by a coordinate-based neural network, whose inputs are the spatiotemporal coordinates and outputs are the corresponding RGB values. CURE introduces a new architecture that conditions the neural network on the input frames for imposing space-time consistency in the synthesized video. This not only improves the final interpolation quality, but also enables CURE to learn a prior across multiple videos. Experimental evaluations show that CURE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video interpolation on several benchmark datasets.",2022-02-28T23:16:02Z,2022-02-28T23:16:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00137v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00137v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
A Perceptual Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation,"Qiqi Hou, Abhijay Ghildyal, Feng Liu","Research on video frame interpolation has made significant progress in recent years. However, existing methods mostly use off-the-shelf metrics to measure the quality of interpolation results with the exception of a few methods that employ user studies, which is time-consuming. As video frame interpolation results often exhibit unique artifacts, existing quality metrics sometimes are not consistent with human perception when measuring the interpolation results. Some recent deep learning-based perceptual quality metrics are shown more consistent with human judgments, but their performance on videos is compromised since they do not consider temporal information. In this paper, we present a dedicated perceptual quality metric for measuring video frame interpolation results. Our method learns perceptual features directly from videos instead of individual frames. It compares pyramid features extracted from video frames and employs Swin Transformer blocks-based spatio-temporal modules to extract spatio-temporal information. To train our metric, we collected a new video frame interpolation quality assessment dataset. Our experiments show that our dedicated quality metric outperforms state-of-the-art methods when measuring video frame interpolation results.

One of the main challenges here is temporal consistency among edited frames, which is still unresolved. To this end, we propose a novel face video editing framework based on diffusion autoencoders that can successfully extract the decomposed features - for the first time as a face video editing model - of identity and motion from a given video. This modeling allows us to edit the video by simply manipulating the temporally invariant feature to the desired direction for the consistency. Another unique strength of our model is that, since our model is based on diffusion models, it can satisfy both reconstruction and edit capabilities at the same time, and is robust to corner cases in wild face videos (e.g. occluded faces) unlike the existing GAN-based methods.",2022-12-06T07:41:51Z,2023-03-27T11:15:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02802v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02802v2,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG"

The benchmark is constructed by generating negative texts with incorrect action descriptions for a given video and the model is expected to pair a positive text with its corresponding video. Furthermore, we propose a training method called NAVERO which utilizes video-text data augmented with negative texts to enhance composition understanding. We also develop a negative-augmented visual-language matching loss which is used explicitly to benefit from the generated negative text.

This is different from previous methods which only can work on a specific motion domain or show weak control abilities with diffusion prior. To achieve our goal, we design several domain-aware motion field adapters (\ie, MOFA-Adapters) to control the generated motions in the video generation pipeline. For MOFA-Adapters, we consider the temporal motion consistency of the video and generate the dense motion flow from the given sparse control conditions first, and then, the multi-scale features of the given image are wrapped as a guided feature for stable video diffusion generation. We naively train two motion adapters for the manual trajectories and the human landmarks individually since they both contain sparse information about the control. After training, the MOFA-Adapters in different domains can also work together for more controllable video generation.

Localizing Unseen Activities in Video via Image Query,"Zhu Zhang, Zhou Zhao, Zhijie Lin, Jingkuan Song, Deng Cai","Action localization in untrimmed videos is an important topic in the field of video understanding. However, existing action localization methods are restricted to a pre-defined set of actions and cannot localize unseen activities. Thus, we consider a new task to localize unseen activities in videos via image queries, named Image-Based Activity Localization. This task faces three inherent challenges: (1) how to eliminate the influence of semantically inessential contents in image queries; (2) how to deal with the fuzzy localization of inaccurate image queries; (3) how to determine the precise boundaries of target segments. We then propose a novel self-attention interaction localizer to retrieve unseen activities in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, we first devise a region self-attention method with relative position encoding to learn fine-grained image region representations. Then, we employ a local transformer encoder to build multi-step fusion and reasoning of image and video contents. We next adopt an order-sensitive localizer to directly retrieve the target segment.

Compression Ratio Learning and Semantic Communications for Video Imaging,"Bowen Zhang, Zhijin Qin, Geoffrey Ye Li","Camera sensors have been widely used in intelligent robotic systems. Developing camera sensors with high sensing efficiency has always been important to reduce the power, memory, and other related resources. Inspired by recent success on programmable sensors and deep optic methods, we design a novel video compressed sensing system with spatially-variant compression ratios, which achieves higher imaging quality than the existing snapshot compressed imaging methods with the same sensing costs. In this article, we also investigate the data transmission methods for programmable sensors, where the performance of communication systems is evaluated by the reconstructed images or videos rather than the transmission of sensor data itself. Usually, different reconstruction algorithms are designed for applications in high dynamic range imaging, video compressive sensing, or motion debluring. This task-aware property inspires a semantic communication framework for programmable sensors. In this work, a policy-gradient based reinforcement learning method is introduced to achieve the explicit trade-off between the compression (or transmission) rate and the image distortion.

Animate Anyone: Consistent and Controllable Image-to-Video Synthesis for   Character Animation,"Li Hu, Xin Gao, Peng Zhang, Ke Sun, Bang Zhang, Liefeng Bo","Character Animation aims to generating character videos from still images through driving signals. Currently, diffusion models have become the mainstream in visual generation research, owing to their robust generative capabilities. However, challenges persist in the realm of image-to-video, especially in character animation, where temporally maintaining consistency with detailed information from character remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image, we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity, we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames.

Subjective and Objective Analysis of Streamed Gaming Videos,"Xiangxu Yu, Zhenqiang Ying, Neil Birkbeck, Yilin Wang, Balu Adsumilli, Alan C. Bovik","The rising popularity of online User-Generated-Content (UGC) in the form of streamed and shared videos, has hastened the development of perceptual Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models, which can be used to help optimize their delivery. Gaming videos, which are a relatively new type of UGC videos, are created when skilled gamers post videos of their gameplay. These kinds of screenshots of UGC gameplay videos have become extremely popular on major streaming platforms like YouTube and Twitch. Synthetically-generated gaming content presents challenges to existing VQA algorithms, including those based on natural scene/video statistics models. Synthetically generated gaming content presents different statistical behavior than naturalistic videos. A number of studies have been directed towards understanding the perceptual characteristics of professionally generated gaming videos arising in gaming video streaming, online gaming, and cloud gaming. However, little work has been done on understanding the quality of UGC gaming videos, and how it can be characterized and predicted. Towards boosting the progress of gaming video VQA model development, we conducted a comprehensive study of subjective and objective VQA models on UGC gaming videos.

REDUCIO! Generating 1024$\times$1024 Video within 16 Seconds using   Extremely Compressed Motion Latents,"Rui Tian, Qi Dai, Jianmin Bao, Kai Qiu, Yifan Yang, Chong Luo, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang","Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain much more redundant information than images, thus can be encoded by very few motion latents based on a content image. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE to encode a video to an extremely compressed motion latent space. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Training diffusion models on such a compact representation easily allows for generating 1K resolution videos. We then adopt a two-stage video generation paradigm, which performs text-to-image and text-image-to-video sequentially. Extensive experiments show that our Reducio-DiT achieves strong performance in evaluation, though trained with limited GPU resources. More importantly, our method significantly boost the efficiency of video LDMs both in training and inference. We train Reducio-DiT in around 3.2K training hours in total and generate a 16-frame 1024*1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

LatentWarp: Consistent Diffusion Latents for Zero-Shot Video-to-Video   Translation,"Yuxiang Bao, Di Qiu, Guoliang Kang, Baochang Zhang, Bo Jin, Kaiye Wang, Pengfei Yan","Leveraging the generative ability of image diffusion models offers great potential for zero-shot video-to-video translation. The key lies in how to maintain temporal consistency across generated video frames by image diffusion models. Previous methods typically adopt cross-frame attention, \emph{i.e.,} sharing the \textit{key} and \textit{value} tokens across attentions of different frames, to encourage the temporal consistency. However, in those works, temporal inconsistency issue may not be thoroughly solved, rendering the fidelity of generated videos limited.%The current state of the art cross-frame attention method aims at maintaining fine-grained visual details across frames, but it is still challenged by the temporal coherence problem. In this paper, we find the bottleneck lies in the unconstrained query tokens and propose a new zero-shot video-to-video translation framework, named \textit{LatentWarp}. Our approach is simple: to constrain the query tokens to be temporally consistent, we further incorporate a warping operation in the latent space to constrain the query tokens. Specifically, based on the optical flow obtained from the original video, we warp the generated latent features of last frame to align with the current frame during the denoising process. As a result, the corresponding regions across the adjacent frames can share closely-related query tokens and attention outputs, which can further improve latent-level consistency to enhance visual temporal coherence of generated videos.

Camera Fingerprint Extraction via Spatial Domain Averaged Frames,"Samet Taspinar, Manoranjan Mohanty, Nasir Memon","Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) based camera attribution is an effective method to determine the source camera of visual media (an image or a video). To apply this method, images or videos need to be obtained from a camera to create a ""camera fingerprint"" which then can be compared against the PRNU of the query media whose origin is under question. The fingerprint extraction process can be time-consuming when a large number of video frames or images have to be denoised. This may need to be done when the individual images have been subjected to high compression or other geometric processing such as video stabilization. This paper investigates a simple, yet effective and efficient technique to create a camera fingerprint when so many still images need to be denoised. The technique utilizes Spatial Domain Averaged (SDA) frames. An SDA-frame is the arithmetic mean of multiple still images. When it is used for fingerprint extraction, the number of denoising operations can be significantly decreased with little or no performance loss.

Unfolding a blurred image,"Kuldeep Purohit, Anshul Shah, A. N. Rajagopalan","We present a solution for the goal of extracting a video from a single motion blurred image to sequentially reconstruct the clear views of a scene as beheld by the camera during the time of exposure. We first learn motion representation from sharp videos in an unsupervised manner through training of a convolutional recurrent video autoencoder network that performs a surrogate task of video reconstruction. Once trained, it is employed for guided training of a motion encoder for blurred images. This network extracts embedded motion information from the blurred image to generate a sharp video in conjunction with the trained recurrent video decoder. As an intermediate step, we also design an efficient architecture that enables real-time single image deblurring and outperforms competing methods across all factors: accuracy, speed, and compactness. Experiments on real scenes and standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art and its ability to generate a plausible sequence of temporally consistent sharp frames.",2022-01-28T09:39:55Z,2022-01-28T09:39:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12010v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12010v1,cs.CV
Depth estimation from 4D light field videos,"Takahiro Kinoshita, Satoshi Ono","Depth (disparity) estimation from 4D Light Field (LF) images has been a research topic for the last couple of years.

This study also constructs a medium-scale synthetic 4D LF video dataset that can be used for training deep learning-based methods.

"UAV Immersive Video Streaming: A Comprehensive Survey, Benchmarking, and   Open Challenges","Mohit K. Sharma, Chen-Feng Liu, Ibrahim Farhat, Nassim Sehad, Wassim Hamidouche, Merouane Debbah","Over the past decade, the utilization of UAVs has witnessed significant growth, owing to their agility, rapid deployment, and maneuverability. In particular, the use of UAV-mounted 360-degree cameras to capture omnidirectional videos has enabled truly immersive viewing experiences with up to 6DoF. However, achieving this immersive experience necessitates encoding omnidirectional videos in high resolution, leading to increased bitrates. Consequently, new challenges arise in terms of latency, throughput, perceived quality, and energy consumption for real-time streaming of such content. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of research efforts in UAV-based immersive video streaming, benchmarks popular video encoding schemes, and identifies open research challenges. Initially, we review the literature on 360-degree video coding, packaging, and streaming, with a particular focus on standardization efforts to ensure interoperability of immersive video streaming devices and services. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of research efforts focused on optimizing video streaming for timevarying UAV wireless channels. Additionally, we introduce a high resolution 360-degree video dataset captured from UAVs under different flying conditions. This dataset facilitates the evaluation of complexity and coding efficiency of software and hardware video encoders based on popular video coding standards and formats, including AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, VVC/H.266, VP9, and AV1. Our results demonstrate that HEVC achieves the best trade-off between coding efficiency and complexity through its hardware implementation, while AV1 format excels in coding efficiency through its software implementation, specifically using the libsvt-av1 encoder.

Urology, specifically, is one field of medicine that is primed for the adoption of a real-time image segmentation system with the long-term aim of automating endoscopic stone treatment. In this project, we explored supervised deep learning models to annotate kidney stones in surgical endoscopic video feeds. In this paper, we describe how we built a dataset from the raw videos and how we developed a pipeline to automate as much of the process as possible. For the segmentation task, we adapted and analyzed three baseline deep learning models -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DenseNet -- to predict annotations on the frames of the endoscopic videos with the highest accuracy above 90\%.

Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Video Compressive Sensing,"Sidi Lu, Xin Yuan, Aggelos K Katsaggelos, Weisong Shi","We apply reinforcement learning to video compressive sensing to adapt the compression ratio. Specifically, video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI), which captures high-speed video using a low-speed camera is considered in this work, in which multiple (B) video frames can be reconstructed from a snapshot measurement. One research gap in previous studies is how to adapt B in the video SCI system for different scenes. In this paper, we fill this gap utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). An RL model, as well as various convolutional neural networks for reconstruction, are learned to achieve adaptive sensing of video SCI systems. Furthermore, the performance of an object detection network using directly the video SCI measurements without reconstruction is also used to perform RL-based adaptive video compressive sensing.

We propose a learning framework StructureViT (SViT for short), which demonstrates how utilizing the structure of a small number of images only available during training can improve a video model. SViT relies on two key insights. First, as both images and videos contain structured information, we enrich a transformer model with a set of \emph{object tokens} that can be used across images and videos. Second, the scene representations of individual frames in video should ""align"" with those of still images. This is achieved via a ""Frame-Clip Consistency"" loss, which ensures the flow of structured information between images and videos.

"Video K-Net: A Simple, Strong, and Unified Baseline for Video   Segmentation","Xiangtai Li, Wenwei Zhang, Jiangmiao Pang, Kai Chen, Guangliang Cheng, Yunhai Tong, Chen Change Loy","This paper presents Video K-Net, a simple, strong, and unified framework for fully end-to-end video panoptic segmentation. The method is built upon K-Net, a method that unifies image segmentation via a group of learnable kernels. We observe that these learnable kernels from K-Net, which encode object appearances and contexts, can naturally associate identical instances across video frames. Motivated by this observation, Video K-Net learns to simultaneously segment and track ""things"" and ""stuff"" in a video with simple kernel-based appearance modeling and cross-temporal kernel interaction. Despite the simplicity, it achieves state-of-the-art video panoptic segmentation results on Citscapes-VPS, KITTI-STEP, and VIPSeg without bells and whistles. In particular, on KITTI-STEP, the simple method can boost almost 12\% relative improvements over previous methods. On VIPSeg, Video K-Net boosts almost 15\% relative improvements and results in 39.8 % VPQ. We also validate its generalization on video semantic segmentation, where we boost various baselines by 2\% on the VSPW dataset. Moreover, we extend K-Net into clip-level video framework for video instance segmentation, where we obtain 40.5% mAP for ResNet50 backbone and 54.1% mAP for Swin-base on YouTube-2019 validation set.

Generative Ghost: Investigating Ranking Bias Hidden in AI-Generated   Videos,"Haowen Gao, Liang Pang, Shicheng Xu, Leigang Qu, Tat-Seng Chua, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng","With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.",2025-02-11T07:43:47Z,2025-02-11T07:43:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07327v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07327v1,"cs.IR, cs.CV"
SwinBERT: End-to-End Transformers with Sparse Attention for Video   Captioning,"Kevin Lin, Linjie Li, Chung-Ching Lin, Faisal Ahmed, Zhe Gan, Zicheng Liu, Yumao Lu, Lijuan Wang","The canonical approach to video captioning dictates a caption generation model to learn from offline-extracted dense video features. These feature extractors usually operate on video frames sampled at a fixed frame rate and are often trained on image/video understanding tasks, without adaption to video captioning data. In this work, we present SwinBERT, an end-to-end transformer-based model for video captioning, which takes video frame patches directly as inputs, and outputs a natural language description. Instead of leveraging multiple 2D/3D feature extractors, our method adopts a video transformer to encode spatial-temporal representations that can adapt to variable lengths of video input without dedicated design for different frame rates. Based on this model architecture, we show that video captioning can benefit significantly from more densely sampled video frames as opposed to previous successes with sparsely sampled video frames for video-and-language understanding tasks (e.g., video question answering). Moreover, to avoid the inherent redundancy in consecutive video frames, we propose adaptively learning a sparse attention mask and optimizing it for task-specific performance improvement through better long-range video sequence modeling. Through extensive experiments on 5 video captioning datasets, we show that SwinBERT achieves across-the-board performance improvements over previous methods, often by a large margin. The learned sparse attention masks in addition push the limit to new state of the arts, and can be transferred between different video lengths and between different datasets.

Visual Summarization of Lecture Video Segments for Enhanced Navigation,"Mohammad Rajiur Rahman, Jaspal Subhlok, Shishir Shah","Lecture videos are an increasingly important learning resource for higher education. However, the challenge of quickly finding the content of interest in a lecture video is an important limitation of this format. This paper introduces visual summarization of lecture video segments to enhance navigation. A lecture video is divided into segments based on the frame-to-frame similarity of content. The user navigates the lecture video content by viewing a single frame visual and textual summary of each segment. The paper presents a novel methodology to generate the visual summary of a lecture video segment by computing similarities between images extracted from the segment and employing a graph-based algorithm to identify the subset of most representative images. The results from this research are integrated into a real-world lecture video management portal called Videopoints. To collect ground truth for evaluation, a survey was conducted where multiple users manually provided visual summaries for 40 lecture video segments. The users also stated whether any images were not selected for the summary because they were similar to other selected images. The graph based algorithm for identifying summary images achieves 78% precision and 72% F1-measure with frequently selected images as the ground truth, and 94% precision and 72% F1-measure with the union of all user selected images as the ground truth. For 98% of algorithm selected visual summary images, at least one user also selected that image for their summary or considered it similar to another image they selected. Over 65% of automatically generated summaries were rated as good or very good by the users on a 4-point scale from poor to very good. Overall, the results establish that the methodology introduced in this paper produces good quality visual summaries that are practically useful for lecture video navigation.",2020-06-03T16:53:54Z,2020-06-03T16:53:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02434v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02434v1,"cs.CV, cs.MM"

In contrast to previous methods that directly learn the complicated image-to-video mapping, Motion-I2V factorizes I2V into two stages with explicit motion modeling. For the first stage, we propose a diffusion-based motion field predictor, which focuses on deducing the trajectories of the reference image's pixels. For the second stage, we propose motion-augmented temporal attention to enhance the limited 1-D temporal attention in video latent diffusion models. This module can effectively propagate reference image's feature to synthesized frames with the guidance of predicted trajectories from the first stage. Compared with existing methods, Motion-I2V can generate more consistent videos even at the presence of large motion and viewpoint variation. By training a sparse trajectory ControlNet for the first stage, Motion-I2V can support users to precisely control motion trajectories and motion regions with sparse trajectory and region annotations. This offers more controllability of the I2V process than solely relying on textual instructions. Additionally, Motion-I2V's second stage naturally supports zero-shot video-to-video translation. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the advantages of Motion-I2V over prior approaches in consistent and controllable image-to-video generation.

While the state-of-the-art of vid2vid has advanced significantly, existing approaches share two major limitations. First, they are data-hungry. Numerous images of a target human subject or a scene are required for training. Second, a learned model has limited generalization capability. A pose-to-human vid2vid model can only synthesize poses of the single person in the training set. It does not generalize to other humans that are not in the training set. To address the limitations, we propose a few-shot vid2vid framework, which learns to synthesize videos of previously unseen subjects or scenes by leveraging few example images of the target at test time. Our model achieves this few-shot generalization capability via a novel network weight generation module utilizing an attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experimental validations with comparisons to strong baselines using several large-scale video datasets including human-dancing videos, talking-head videos, and street-scene videos.

Deep Slow Motion Video Reconstruction with Hybrid Imaging System,"Avinash Paliwal, Nima Khademi Kalantari","Slow motion videos are becoming increasingly popular, but capturing high-resolution videos at extremely high frame rates requires professional high-speed cameras. To mitigate this problem, current techniques increase the frame rate of standard videos through frame interpolation by assuming linear object motion which is not valid in challenging cases. In this paper, we address this problem using two video streams as input; an auxiliary video with high frame rate and low spatial resolution, providing temporal information, in addition to the standard main video with low frame rate and high spatial resolution. We propose a two-stage deep learning system consisting of alignment and appearance estimation that reconstructs high resolution slow motion video from the hybrid video input. For alignment, we propose to compute flows between the missing frame and two existing frames of the main video by utilizing the content of the auxiliary video frames. For appearance estimation, we propose to combine the warped and auxiliary frames using a context and occlusion aware network.

To address the above issues, we propose DragVideo, a general drag-style video editing framework. Inspired by DragGAN, DragVideo addresses issues 1) and 2) by proposing the drag-style video latent optimization method which gives desired control by updating noisy video latent according to drag instructions through video-level drag objective function.

Transformer architectures have shown great performance in both machine translation and image captioning, lacking a straightforward and reproducible application for VTT. However, there is no comprehensive study on different strategies and advice for video description generation including exploiting the accompanying audio with fully self-attentive networks. Thus, we explore promising approaches from image captioning and video processing and apply them to VTT by developing a straightforward Transformer architecture. Additionally, we present a novel way of synchronizing audio and video features in Transformers which we call Fractional Positional Encoding (FPE).

Exposing DeepFake Videos By Detecting Face Warping Artifacts,"Yuezun Li, Siwei Lyu","In this work, we describe a new deep learning based method that can effectively distinguish AI-generated fake videos (referred to as {\em DeepFake} videos hereafter) from real videos. Our method is based on the observations that current DeepFake algorithm can only generate images of limited resolutions, which need to be further warped to match the original faces in the source video. Such transforms leave distinctive artifacts in the resulting DeepFake videos, and we show that they can be effectively captured by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared to previous methods which use a large amount of real and DeepFake generated images to train CNN classifier, our method does not need DeepFake generated images as negative training examples since we target the artifacts in affine face warping as the distinctive feature to distinguish real and fake images. The advantages of our method are two-fold: (1) Such artifacts can be simulated directly using simple image processing operations on a image to make it as negative example. Since training a DeepFake model to generate negative examples is time-consuming and resource-demanding, our method saves a plenty of time and resources in training data collection; (2) Since such artifacts are general existed in DeepFake videos from different sources, our method is more robust compared to others.

From Thumbnails to Summaries - A single Deep Neural Network to Rule Them   All,"Hongxiang Gu, Viswanathan Swaminathan","Video summaries come in many forms, from traditional single-image thumbnails, animated thumbnails, storyboards, to trailer-like video summaries. Content creators use the summaries to display the most attractive portion of their videos; the users use them to quickly evaluate if a video is worth watching. All forms of summaries are essential to video viewers, content creators, and advertisers. Often video content management systems have to generate multiple versions of summaries that vary in duration and presentational forms. We present a framework ReconstSum that utilizes LSTM-based autoencoder architecture to extract and select a sparse subset of video frames or keyshots that optimally represent the input video in an unsupervised manner. The encoder selects a subset from the input video while the decoder seeks to reconstruct the video from the selection. The goal is to minimize the difference between the original input video and the reconstructed video. Our method is easily extendable to generate a variety of applications including static video thumbnails, animated thumbnails, storyboards and ""trailer-like"" highlights. We specifically study and evaluate two most popular use cases: thumbnail generation and storyboard generation. We demonstrate that our methods generate better results than the state-of-the-art techniques in both use cases.",2018-08-01T06:24:39Z,2018-08-01T06:24:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00184v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00184v1,"cs.MM, cs.CV"
Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of   Images and Videos,"Haobo Yuan, Xiangtai Li, Tao Zhang, Zilong Huang, Shilin Xu, Shunping Ji, Yunhai Tong, Lu Qi, Jiashi Feng, Ming-Hsuan Yang","This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.",2025-01-07T18:58:54Z,2025-02-13T18:14:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04001v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04001v2,cs.CV
Intelligent Director: An Automatic Framework for Dynamic Visual   Composition using ChatGPT,"Sixiao Zheng, Jingyang Huo, Yu Wang, Yanwei Fu","With the rise of short video platforms represented by TikTok, the trend of users expressing their creativity through photos and videos has increased dramatically. However, ordinary users lack the professional skills to produce high-quality videos using professional creation software. To meet the demand for intelligent and user-friendly video creation tools, we propose the Dynamic Visual Composition (DVC) task, an interesting and challenging task that aims to automatically integrate various media elements based on user requirements and create storytelling videos. We propose an Intelligent Director framework, utilizing LENS to generate descriptions for images and video frames and combining ChatGPT to generate coherent captions while recommending appropriate music names. Then, the best-matched music is obtained through music retrieval. Then, materials such as captions, images, videos, and music are integrated to seamlessly synthesize the video. Finally, we apply AnimeGANv2 for style transfer. We construct UCF101-DVC and Personal Album datasets and verified the effectiveness of our framework in solving DVC through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, along with user studies, demonstrating its substantial potential.",2024-02-24T06:58:15Z,2024-02-24T06:58:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15746v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15746v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.MM"
LumiSculpt: A Consistency Lighting Control Network for Video Generation,"Yuxin Zhang, Dandan Zheng, Biao Gong, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang, Weiming Dong, Changsheng Xu","Lighting plays a pivotal role in ensuring the naturalness of video generation, significantly influencing the aesthetic quality of the generated content. However, due to the deep coupling between lighting and the temporal features of videos, it remains challenging to disentangle and model independent and coherent lighting attributes, limiting the ability to control lighting in video generation. In this paper, inspired by the established controllable T2I models, we propose LumiSculpt, which, for the first time, enables precise and consistent lighting control in T2V generation models.LumiSculpt equips the video generation with strong interactive capabilities, allowing the input of custom lighting reference image sequences. Furthermore, the core learnable plug-and-play module of LumiSculpt facilitates remarkable control over lighting intensity, position, and trajectory in latent video diffusion models based on the advanced DiT backbone.Additionally, to effectively train LumiSculpt and address the issue of insufficient lighting data, we construct LumiHuman, a new lightweight and flexible dataset for portrait lighting of images and videos. Experimental results demonstrate that LumiSculpt achieves precise and high-quality lighting control in video generation.",2024-10-30T12:44:08Z,2024-10-30T12:44:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22979v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22979v1,cs.CV
Video Captioning with Transferred Semantic Attributes,"Yingwei Pan, Ting Yao, Houqiang Li, Tao Mei","Automatically generating natural language descriptions of videos plays a fundamental challenge for computer vision community. Most recent progress in this problem has been achieved through employing 2-D and/or 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to encode video content and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to decode a sentence. In this paper, we present Long Short-Term Memory with Transferred Semantic Attributes (LSTM-TSA)---a novel deep architecture that incorporates the transferred semantic attributes learnt from images and videos into the CNN plus RNN framework, by training them in an end-to-end manner. The design of LSTM-TSA is highly inspired by the facts that 1) semantic attributes play a significant contribution to captioning, and 2) images and videos carry complementary semantics and thus can reinforce each other for captioning. To boost video captioning, we propose a novel transfer unit to model the mutually correlated attributes learnt from images and videos. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, i.e., MSVD, M-VAD and MPII-MD. Our proposed LSTM-TSA achieves to-date the best published performance in sentence generation on MSVD: 52.8% and 74.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and CIDEr-D. Superior results when compared to state-of-the-art methods are also reported on M-VAD and MPII-MD.",2016-11-23T07:59:59Z,2016-11-23T07:59:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07675v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07675v1,cs.CV
Sweet Streams are Made of This: The System Engineer's View on Energy   Efficiency in Video Communications,"Christian Herglotz, Matthias Kränzler, Robert Schober, André Kaup","In recent years, the global use of online video services has increased rapidly. Today, a manifold of applications, such as video streaming, video conferencing, live broadcasting, and social networks, make use of this technology. A recent study found that the development and the success of these services had as a consequence that, nowadays, more than 1% of the global greenhouse-gas emissions are related to online video, with growth rates close to 10% per year. This article reviews the latest findings concerning energy consumption of online video from the system engineer's perspective, where the system engineer is the designer and operator of a typical online video service. We discuss all relevant energy sinks, highlight dependencies with quality-of-service variables as well as video properties, review energy consumption models for different devices from the literature, and aggregate these existing models into a global model for the overall energy consumption of a generic online video service. Analyzing this model and its implications, we find that end-user devices and video encoding have the largest potential for energy savings. Finally, we provide an overview of recent advances in energy efficiency improvement for video streaming and propose future research directions for energy-efficient video streaming services.",2022-09-30T12:04:30Z,2022-09-30T12:04:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15405v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15405v1,eess.IV
