Qlib: An AI-oriented Quantitative Investment Platform,"Xiao Yang, Weiqing Liu, Dong Zhou, Jiang Bian, Tie-Yan Liu","Quantitative investment aims to maximize the return and minimize the risk in a sequential trading period over a set of financial instruments. Recently, inspired by rapid development and great potential of AI technologies in generating remarkable innovation in quantitative investment, there has been increasing adoption of AI-driven workflow for quantitative research and practical investment. In the meantime of enriching the quantitative investment methodology, AI technologies have raised new challenges to the quantitative investment system. Particularly, the new learning paradigms for quantitative investment call for an infrastructure upgrade to accommodate the renovated workflow; moreover, the data-driven nature of AI technologies indeed indicates a requirement of the infrastructure with more powerful performance; additionally, there exist some unique challenges for applying AI technologies to solve different tasks in the financial scenarios. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between AI technologies and quantitative investment, we design and develop Qlib that aims to realize the potential, empower the research, and create the value of AI technologies in quantitative investment.",2020-09-22T12:57:10Z,2020-09-22T12:57:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11189v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11189v1,"q-fin.GN, cs.LG, q-fin.PM"

Quantitatively Nonblocking Supervisory Control of Discrete-Event Systems,"Renyuan Zhang, Jiahao Wang, Zenghui Wang, Kai Cai","In this paper, we propose two new nonblocking properties of automata as quantitative measures of maximal distances to marker states. The first property, called {\em quantitative nonblockingness}, captures the practical requirement that at least one of the marker states (representing e.g. task completion) be reachable within a prescribed number of steps from any non-marker state and following any trajectory of the system. The second property, called {\em heterogeneously quantitative nonblockingness}, distinguishes individual marker states and requires that each marker state be reached within a given bounded number of steps from any other state and following any trajectory of the system. Accordingly, we formulate two new problems of quantitatively nonblocking supervisory control and heterogeneously quantitatively nonblocking supervisory control, and characterize their solvabilities in terms of new concepts of quantitative language completability and heterogeneously quantitative language completability, respectively. It is proved that there exists the unique supremal (heterogeneously) quantitatively completable sublanguage of a given language, and we develop effective algorithms to compute the supremal sublanguages. Finally, combining with the algorithm of computing the supremal controllable sublanguage, we design algorithms to compute the maximally permissive solutions to the formulated (heterogeneously) quantitatively nonblocking supervisory control problems.",2021-08-02T08:45:55Z,2023-12-20T09:12:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00721v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00721v4,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Model Checking the Quantitative mu-Calculus on Linear Hybrid Systems,"Diana Fischer, Lukasz Kaiser","We study the model-checking problem for a quantitative extension of the modal mu-calculus on a class of hybrid systems. Qualitative model checking has been proved decidable and implemented for several classes of systems, but this is not the case for quantitative questions that arise naturally in this context. Recently, quantitative formalisms that subsume classical temporal logics and allow the measurement of interesting quantitative phenomena were introduced. We show how a powerful quantitative logic, the quantitative mu-calculus, can be model checked with arbitrary precision on initialised linear hybrid systems. To this end, we develop new techniques for the discretisation of continuous state spaces based on a special class of strategies in model-checking games and present a reduction to a class of counter parity games.",2012-09-08T18:22:30Z,2012-09-19T09:08:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1738v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.1738v2,"cs.LO, D.2.4, F.4.1"
Quantitative Reductions and Vertex-Ranked Infinite Games (Full Version),Alexander Weinert,"We introduce quantitative reductions, a novel technique for structuring the space of quantitative games and solving them that does not rely on a reduction to qualitative games. We show that such reductions exhibit the same desirable properties as their qualitative counterparts and that they additionally retain the optimality of solutions. Moreover, we introduce vertex-ranked games as a general-purpose target for quantitative reductions and show how to solve them. In such games, the value of a play is determined only by a qualitative winning condition and a ranking of the vertices.   We provide quantitative reductions of quantitative request-response games and of quantitative Muller games to vertex-ranked games, thus showing EXPTIME-completeness of solving the former two kinds of games. In addition, we exhibit the usefulness and flexibility of vertex-ranked games by showing how to use such games to compute fault-resilient strategies for safety specifications.

Quantitative probing: Validating causal models using quantitative domain   knowledge,"Daniel Grünbaum, Maike L. Stern, Elmar W.

The method is constructed as an analogue of the train/test split in correlation-based machine learning and as an enhancement of current causal validation strategies that are consistent with the logic of scientific discovery. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated using Pearl's sprinkler example, before a thorough simulation-based investigation is conducted. Limits of the technique are identified by studying exemplary failing scenarios, which are furthermore used to propose a list of topics for future research and improvements of the presented version of quantitative probing.

Limited range extrapolation with quantitative bounds and applications,"Mingming Cao, Honghai Liu, Zengyan Si, Kôzô Yabuta","In recent years, sharp or quantitative weighted inequalities have attracted considerable attention on account of $A_2$ conjecture solved by Hyt\""{o}nen. Advances have greatly improved conceptual understanding of classical objects such as Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators. However, plenty of operators do not fit into the class of Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators and fail to be bounded on all $L^p(w)$ spaces for $p \in (1, \infty)$ and $w \in A_p$. In this paper we develop Rubio de Francia extrapolation with quantitative bounds to investigate quantitative weighted inequalities for operators beyond the (multilinear) Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory. We mainly establish a quantitative multilinear limited range extrapolation in terms of exponents $p_i \in (\mathfrak{p}_i^-, \mathfrak{p}_i^+)$ and weights $w_i^{p_i} \in A_{p_i/\mathfrak{p}_i^-} \cap RH_{(\mathfrak{p}_i^+/p_i)'}$, $i=1, \ldots, m$, which refines a result of Cruz-Uribe and Martell. We also present an extrapolation from multilinear operators to the corresponding commutators. Additionally, our result is quantitative and allows us to extend special quantitative estimates in the Banach space setting to the quasi-Banach space setting. Our proof is based on an off-diagonal extrapolation result with quantitative bounds. Finally, we present various applications to illustrate the utility of extrapolation by concentrating on quantitative weighted estimates for some typical multilinear operators such as bilinear Bochner-Riesz means, bilinear rough singular integrals, and multilinear Fourier multipliers. In the linear case, based on the Littlewood-Paley theory, we include weighted jump and variational inequalities for rough singular integrals.",2022-06-25T06:15:47Z,2022-06-28T15:02:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12570v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12570v2,"math.CA, 42B20, 42B25"
Innovative Quantitative Analysis for Disease Progression Assessment in   Familial Cerebral Cavernous Malformations,"Ruige Zong, Tao Wang, Chunwang Li, Xinlin Zhang, Yuanbin Chen, Longxuan Zhao, Qixuan Li, Qinquan Gao, Dezhi Kang, Fuxin Lin, Tong Tong","Familial cerebral cavernous malformation (FCCM) is a hereditary disorder characterized by abnormal vascular structures within the central nervous system. The FCCM lesions are often numerous and intricate, making quantitative analysis of the lesions a labor-intensive task. Consequently, clinicians face challenges in quantitatively assessing the severity of lesions and determining whether lesions have progressed. To alleviate this problem, we propose a quantitative statistical framework for FCCM, comprising an efficient annotation module, an FCCM lesion segmentation module, and an FCCM lesion quantitative statistics module. Our framework demonstrates precise segmentation of the FCCM lesion based on efficient data annotation, achieving a Dice coefficient of 93.22\%. More importantly, we focus on quantitative statistics of lesions, which is combined with image registration to realize the quantitative comparison of lesions between different examinations of patients, and a visualization framework has been established for doctors to comprehensively compare and analyze lesions. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed framework not only obtains objective, accurate, and comprehensive quantitative statistical information, which provides a quantitative assessment method for disease progression and drug efficacy study, but also considerably reduces the manual measurement and statistical workload of lesions, assisting clinical decision-making for FCCM and accelerating progress in FCCM clinical research. This highlights the potential of practical application of the framework in FCCM clinical research and clinical decision-making.

Contrast-Agnostic Groupwise Registration by Robust PCA for Quantitative   Cardiac MRI,"Xinqi Li, Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Jan van Gemert, Qian Tao","Quantitative cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly important diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. Yet, co-registration of all baseline images within the quantitative MRI sequence is essential for the accuracy and precision of quantitative maps. However, co-registering all baseline images from a quantitative cardiac MRI sequence remains a nontrivial task because of the simultaneous changes in intensity and contrast, in combination with cardiac and respiratory motion. To address the challenge, we propose a novel motion correction framework based on robust principle component analysis (rPCA) that decomposes quantitative cardiac MRI into low-rank and sparse components, and we integrate the groupwise CNN-based registration backbone within the rPCA framework. The low-rank component of rPCA corresponds to the quantitative mapping (i.e. limited degree of freedom in variation), while the sparse component corresponds to the residual motion, making it easier to formulate and solve the groupwise registration problem. We evaluated our proposed method on cardiac T1 mapping by the modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence, both before and after the Gadolinium contrast agent administration. Our experiments showed that our method effectively improved registration performance over baseline methods without introducing rPCA, and reduced quantitative mapping error in both in-domain (pre-contrast MOLLI) and out-of-domain (post-contrast MOLLI) inference. The proposed rPCA framework is generic and can be integrated with other registration backbones.",2023-11-03T13:48:13Z,2023-11-03T13:48:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01916v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01916v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

Moreover, we introduce vertex-ranked games as a general-purpose target for quantitative reductions and show how to solve them. In such games, the value of a play is determined only by a qualitative winning condition and a ranking of the vertices.   We provide quantitative reductions of quantitative request-response games to vertex-ranked games, thus showing ExpTime-completeness of solving the former games. Furthermore, we exhibit the usefulness and flexibility of vertex-ranked games by showing how to use such games to compute fault-resilient strategies for safety specifications.

A Bayesian test to identify variance effects,"Bianca Dumitrascu, Gregory Darnell, Julien Ayroles, Barbara E Engelhardt","Identifying genetic variants that regulate quantitative traits, or QTLs, is the primary focus of the field of statistical genetics. Most current methods are limited to identifying mean effects, or associations between genotype and the mean value of a quantitative trait. It is possible, however, that a genetic variant may affect the variance of the quantitative trait in lieu of, or in addition to, affecting the trait mean. Here, we develop a general methodological approach to identifying covariates with variance effects on a quantitative trait using a Bayesian heteroskedastic linear regression model. We show that our Bayesian test for heteroskedasticity (BTH) outperforms classical tests for differences in variation across a large range of simulations drawn from scenarios common to the analysis of quantitative traits. We apply BTH to methylation QTL study data and expression QTL study data to identify variance QTLs.

Ellen Grant, Berkin Bilgic","Purpose: Volumetric, high-resolution, quantitative mapping of brain tissue relaxation properties is hindered by long acquisition times and signal-to-noise (SNR) challenges. This study, for the first time, combines the time-efficient wave-CAIPI readouts into the 3D-quantification using an interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence with a T2 preparation pulse (3D-QALAS) acquisition scheme, enabling full brain quantitative T1, T2 and proton density (PD) maps at 1.15 mm3 isotropic voxels in only 3 minutes. Methods: Wave-CAIPI readouts were embedded in the standard 3D-QALAS encoding scheme, enabling full brain quantitative parameter maps (T1, T2, and PD) at acceleration factors of R=3x2 with minimum SNR loss due to g-factor penalties. The quantitative parameter maps were estimated using a dictionary-based mapping algorithm incorporating inversion efficiency and B1 field inhomogeneity. The quantitative maps using the accelerated protocol were quantitatively compared against those obtained from conventional 3D-QALAS sequence using GRAPPA acceleration of R=2 in the ISMRM NIST phantom, and ten healthy volunteers. Results: When tested in both the ISMRM/NIST phantom and ten healthy volunteers, the quantitative maps using the accelerated protocol showed excellent agreement against those obtained from conventional 3D-QALAS at RGRAPPA=2.

"Rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging by a novel method: theory,   simulation testing and proof of principle","Kevin J. Black, Jonathan M. Koller, Brad D. Miller","Pharmacological challenge imaging has mapped, but rarely quantified, the sensitivity of a biological system to a given drug. We describe a novel method called rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging. This method combines pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, repeated small doses of a challenge drug over a short time scale, and functional imaging to rapidly provide quantitative estimates of drug sensitivity including EC50 (the concentration of drug that produces half the maximum possible effect). We first test the method with simulated data, assuming a typical sigmoidal dose-response curve and assuming imperfect imaging that includes artifactual baseline signal drift and random error. With these few assumptions, rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging reliably estimates EC50 from the simulated data, except when noise overwhelms the drug effect or when the effect occurs only at high doses. In preliminary fMRI studies of primate brain using a dopamine agonist, the observed noise level is modest compared with observed drug effects, and a quantitative EC50 can be obtained from some regional time-signal curves. Taken together, these results suggest that research and clinical applications for rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging are realistic.",2013-04-21T15:53:05Z,2014-05-27T00:44:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5756v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5756v3,"q-bio.QM, J.3"
Quantitative Function and Algorithm for Community Detection in Bipartite   Networks,"Zhenping Li, Rui-Sheng Wang, Shihua Zhang, Xiang-Sun Zhang","Community detection in complex networks is a topic of high interest in many fields. Bipartite networks are a special type of complex networks in which nodes are decomposed into two disjoint sets, and only nodes between the two sets can be connected. Bipartite networks represent diverse interaction patterns in many real-world systems, such as predator-prey networks, plant-pollinator networks, and drug-target networks. While community detection in unipartite networks has been extensively studied in the past decade, identification of modules or communities in bipartite networks is still in its early stage. Several quantitative functions proposed for evaluating the quality of bipartite network divisions are based on null models and have distinct resolution limits. In this paper, we propose a new quantitative function for community detection in bipartite networks, and demonstrate that this quantitative function is superior to the widely used Barber's bipartite modularity and other functions. Based on the new quantitative function, the bipartite network community detection problem is formulated into an integer programming model. Bipartite networks can be partitioned into reasonable overlapping communities by maximizing the quantitative function. We further develop a heuristic and adapted label propagation algorithm (BiLPA) to optimize the quantitative function in large-scale bipartite networks. BiLPA does not require any prior knowledge about the number of communities in the networks. We apply BiLPA to both artificial networks and real-world networks and demonstrate that this method can successfully identify the community structures of bipartite networks.",2015-01-02T16:19:27Z,2015-03-31T17:29:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00432v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00432v2,"cs.SI, physics.soc-ph"
One-step Method for Material Quantitation using In-line Tomography with   Single Scanning,"Suyu Liao, Shiwo Deng, Yining Zhu, Huitao Zhang, Peiping Zhu, Kai Zhang, Xing Zhao","Objective: Quantitative technique based on In-line phase-contrast computed tomography with single scanning attracts more attention in application due to the flexibility of the implementation. However, the quantitative results usually suffer from artifacts and noise, since the phase retrieval and reconstruction are independent (""two-steps"") without feedback from the original data. Our goal is to develop a method for material quantitative imaging based on a priori information specifically for the single-scanning data. Method: An iterative method that directly reconstructs the refractive index decrement delta and imaginary beta of the object from observed data (""one-step"") within single object-to-detector distance (ODD) scanning. Simultaneously, high-quality quantitative reconstruction results are obtained by using a linear approximation that achieves material decomposition in the iterative process. Results: By comparing the equivalent atomic number of the material decomposition results in experiments, the accuracy of the proposed method is greater than 97.2%. Conclusion: The quantitative reconstruction and decomposition results are effectively improved, and there are feedback and corrections during the iteration, which effectively reduce the impact of noise and errors.

Quantitative regularity for the Navier-Stokes equations via spatial   concentration,"Tobias Barker, Christophe Prange","This paper is concerned with quantitative estimates for the Navier-Stokes equations.   First we investigate the relation of quantitative bounds to the behaviour of critical norms near a potential singularity with Type I bound $\|u\|_{L^{\infty}_{t}L^{3,\infty}_{x}}\leq M$. Namely, we show that if $T^*$ is a first blow-up time and $(0,T^*)$ is a singular point then $$\|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^{3}(B_{0}(R))}\geq C(M)\log\Big(\frac{1}{T^*-t}\Big),\,\,\,\,\,\,R=O((T^*-t)^{\frac{1}{2}-}).$$ We demonstrate that this potential blow-up rate is optimal for a certain class of potential non-zero backward discretely self-similar solutions.   Second, we quantify the result of Seregin (2012), which says that if $u$ is a smooth finite-energy solution to the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3\times (0,1)$ with $$\sup_{n}\|u(\cdot,t_{(n)})\|_{L^{3}(\mathbb{R}^3)}<\infty\,\,\,\textrm{and}\,\,\,t_{(n)}\uparrow 1,$$ then $u$ does not blow-up at $t=1$.   To prove our results we develop a new strategy for proving quantitative bounds for the Navier-Stokes equations. This hinges on local-in-space smoothing results (near the initial time) established by Jia and \v{S}ver\'{a}k (2014), together with quantitative arguments using Carleman inequalities given by Tao (2019).   Moreover, the technology developed here enables us in particular to give a quantitative bound for the number of singular points in a Type I blow-up scenario.",2020-03-14T22:48:16Z,2020-05-25T08:22:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06717v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06717v3,"math.AP, 35A99, 35B44, 35B65, 35Q30, 76D05"
Quantitative Correlation Inequalities via Semigroup Interpolation,"Anindya De, Shivam Nadimpalli, Rocco A. Servedio","Most correlation inequalities for high-dimensional functions in the literature, such as the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre (FKG) inequality and the celebrated Gaussian Correlation Inequality of Royen, are qualitative statements which establish that any two functions of a certain type have non-negative correlation. In this work we give a general approach that can be used to bootstrap many qualitative correlation inequalities for functions over product spaces into quantitative statements. The approach combines a new extremal result about power series, proved using complex analysis, with harmonic analysis of functions over product spaces. We instantiate this general approach in several different concrete settings to obtain a range of new and near-optimal quantitative correlation inequalities, including:   $\bullet$ A quantitative version of Royen's celebrated Gaussian Correlation Inequality. Royen (2014) confirmed a conjecture, open for 40 years, stating that any two symmetric, convex sets must be non-negatively correlated under any centered Gaussian distribution. We give a lower bound on the correlation in terms of the vector of degree-2 Hermite coefficients of the two convex sets, analogous to the correlation bound for monotone Boolean functions over $\{0,1\}^n$ obtained by Talagrand (1996).   $\bullet$ A quantitative version of the well-known FKG inequality for monotone functions over any finite product probability space, generalizing the quantitative correlation bound for monotone Boolean functions over $\{0,1\}^n$ obtained by Talagrand (1996). The only prior generalization of which we are aware is due to Keller (2008, 2009, 2012), which extended Talagrand's result to product distributions over $\{0,1\}^n$. We also give two different quantitative versions of the FKG inequality for monotone functions over the continuous domain $[0,1]^n$, answering a question of Keller (2009).",2020-12-22T18:03:35Z,2020-12-22T18:03:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12216v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12216v1,"math.PR, cs.CC, math.CO"
Enhancing Quantitative Image Synthesis through Pretraining and   Resolution Scaling for Bone Mineral Density Estimation from a Plain X-ray   Image,"Yi Gu, Yoshito Otake, Keisuke Uemura, Masaki Takao, Mazen Soufi, Seiji Okada, Nobuhiko Sugano, Hugues Talbot, Yoshinobu Sato","While most vision tasks are essentially visual in nature (for recognition), some important tasks, especially in the medical field, also require quantitative analysis (for quantification) using quantitative images. Unlike in visual analysis, pixel values in quantitative images correspond to physical metrics measured by specific devices (e.g., a depth image). However, recent work has shown that it is sometimes possible to synthesize accurate quantitative values from visual ones (e.g., depth from visual cues or defocus). This research aims to improve quantitative image synthesis (QIS) by exploring pretraining and image resolution scaling. We propose a benchmark for evaluating pretraining performance using the task of QIS-based bone mineral density (BMD) estimation from plain X-ray images, where the synthesized quantitative image is used to derive BMD. Our results show that appropriate pretraining can improve QIS performance, significantly raising the correlation of BMD estimation from 0.820 to 0.898, while others do not help or even hinder it. Scaling-up the resolution can further boost the correlation up to 0.923, a significant enhancement over conventional methods.

The consideration of both quantitative and qualitative performance when evaluating a model is unique to certain image-to-image translation tasks like medical imaging of patient data as detailed in this paper. Also, this paper shows that good quantitative performance does not always imply good qualitative performance and the converse is also not always True (i.e. good qualitative performance does not always imply good quantitative performance). This paper also proposes a lightweight model called FQGA (Fast Paired Image-to-Image Translation Quarter-Generator Adversary) which has 1/4 the number of parameters compared to CycleGAN (when comparing their Generator Models). FQGA outperforms CycleGAN qualitatively and quantitatively even only after training on 20 epochs. Finally, using SEM method on FQGA allowed it to again outperform CycleGAN both quantitatively and qualitatively. These performance gains even with fewer model parameters and fewer epochs (which will result in time and computational savings) may also be applicable to other image-to-image translation tasks in Machine Learning apart from the Medical image-translation task discussed in this paper between Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Computed Tomography (CT) images.",2024-08-17T14:55:15Z,2024-08-22T11:23:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09218v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09218v3,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG"
A further improvement of the quantitative Subspace Theorem,"Jan-Hendrik Evertse, Roberto G. Ferretti","In 2002, Evertse and Schlickewei obtained a quantitative version of the so-called Absolute Parametric Subspace Theorem. This result deals with a parametrized class of twisted heights. One of the consequences of this result is a quantitative version of the Absolute Subspace Theorem, giving an explicit upper bound for the number of subspaces containing the solutions of the Diophantine inequality under consideration.   In the present paper, we further improve Evertse's and Schlickewei's quantitative version of the Absolute Parametric Subspace Theorem, and deduce an improved quantitative version of the Absolute Subspace Theorem. We combine ideas from the proof of Evertse and Schlickewei (which is basically a substantial refinement of Schmidt's proof of his Subspace Theorem from 1972, with ideas from Faltings' and Wuestholz' proof of the Subspace Theorem.",2010-08-13T15:12:03Z,2010-08-13T15:12:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2340v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.2340v1,"math.NT, 11J68, 11J25"
Synthesizing Switching Logic to Minimize Long-Run Cost,"Susmit Jha, Sanjit A. Seshia, Ashish Tiwari","Given a multi-modal dynamical system, optimal switching logic synthesis involves generating the conditions for switching between the system modes such that the resulting hybrid system satisfies a quantitative specification. We formalize and solve the problem of optimal switching logic synthesis for quantitative specifications over long run behavior. Each trajectory of the system, and each state of the system, is associated with a cost. Our goal is to synthesize a system that minimizes this cost from each initial state. Our paper generalizes earlier work on synthesis for safety as safety specifications can be encoded as quantitative specifications. We present an approach for specifying quantitative measures using reward and penalty functions, and illustrate its effectiveness using several examples. We present an automated technique to synthesize switching logic for such quantitative measures. Our algorithm is based on reducing the synthesis problem to an unconstrained numerical optimization problem which can be solved by any off-the-shelf numerical optimization engines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with experimental results.",2011-03-03T23:07:51Z,2011-05-05T18:28:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0800v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.0800v2,"cs.SY, math.OC"

A Definition Scheme for Quantitative Bisimulation,"Diego Latella, Mieke Massink, Erik de Vink","FuTS, state-to-function transition systems are generalizations of labeled transition systems and of familiar notions of quantitative semantical models as continuous-time Markov chains, interactive Markov chains, and Markov automata. A general scheme for the definition of a notion of strong bisimulation associated with a FuTS is proposed. It is shown that this notion of bisimulation for a FuTS coincides with the coalgebraic notion of behavioral equivalence associated to the functor on Set given by the type of the FuTS. For a series of concrete quantitative semantical models the notion of bisimulation as reported in the literature is proven to coincide with the notion of quantitative bisimulation obtained from the scheme. The comparison includes models with orthogonal behaviour, like interactive Markov chains, and with multiple levels of behavior, like Markov automata. As a consequence of the general result relating FuTS bisimulation and behavioral equivalence we obtain, in a systematic way, a coalgebraic underpinning of all quantitative bisimulations discussed.",2015-09-29T02:10:46Z,2015-09-29T02:10:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08563v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08563v1,"cs.LO, D.2.4, F.3.2"
Quantitative phase-contrast imaging: a bridge between qualitative   phase-contrast and phase retrieval algorithms,"Nathaniel Hai, Joseph Rosen","In the last five decades, iterative phase retrieval methods draw large amount of interest across the research community as a non-interferometric approach to recover quantitative phase distributions from one (or more) intensity measurement. However, in cases where a unique solution does exist, these methods often require oversampling and high computational resources, which limits the use of this approach in important applications. On the other hand, phase contrast methods are based on a single camera exposure but provides only a qualitative description of the phase, thus are not useful for applications in which the quantitative phase description is needed. In this study we adopt a combined approach of the two above-mentioned methods to overcome their respective drawbacks. We show that a modified phase retrieval algorithm easily converges to the correct solution by initializing the algorithm with a phase-induced intensity measurement, namely with a phase contrast image of the examined object. Accurate quantitative phase measurements for both binary and continuously varying phase objects are demonstrated to support the suggested system as a single-shot quantitative phase contrast microscope.",2020-07-19T06:33:05Z,2020-07-19T06:33:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09602v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09602v1,"physics.optics, eess.IV"
Verification of Quantitative Hyperproperties Using Trace Enumeration   Relations,"Shubham Sahai, Rohit Sinha, Pramod Subramanyan","Many important cryptographic primitives offer probabilistic guarantees of security that can be specified as quantitative hyperproperties; these are specifications that stipulate the existence of a certain number of traces in the system satisfying certain constraints. Verification of such hyperproperties is extremely challenging because they involve simultaneous reasoning about an unbounded number of different traces. In this paper, we introduce a technique for verification of quantitative hyperproperties based on the notion of trace enumeration relations. These relations allow us to reduce the problem of trace-counting into one of model-counting of formulas in first-order logic. We also introduce a set of inference rules for machine-checked reasoning about the number of satisfying solutions to first-order formulas (aka model counting). Putting these two components together enables semi-automated verification of quantitative hyperproperties on infinite state systems. We use our methodology to prove confidentiality of access patterns in Path ORAMs of unbounded size, soundness of a simple interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol as well as other applications of quantitative hyperproperties studied in past work.",2020-05-10T09:01:25Z,2020-05-14T19:20:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04606v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04606v2,"cs.CR, F.3.1"
Diffractive all-optical computing for quantitative phase imaging,"Deniz Mengu, Aydogan Ozcan","Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a label-free computational imaging technique that provides optical path length information of specimens. In modern implementations, the quantitative phase image of an object is reconstructed digitally through numerical methods running in a computer, often using iterative algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a diffractive QPI network that can synthesize the quantitative phase image of an object by converting the input phase information of a scene into intensity variations at the output plane. A diffractive QPI network is a specialized all-optical processor designed to perform a quantitative phase-to-intensity transformation through passive diffractive surfaces that are spatially engineered using deep learning and image data. Forming a compact, all-optical network that axially extends only ~200-300 times the illumination wavelength, this framework can replace traditional QPI systems and related digital computational burden with a set of passive transmissive layers. All-optical diffractive QPI networks can potentially enable power-efficient, high frame-rate and compact phase imaging systems that might be useful for various applications, including, e.g., on-chip microscopy and sensing.",2022-01-22T05:28:44Z,2022-01-22T05:28:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08964v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08964v1,"physics.optics, cs.CV, cs.NE, physics.app-ph"

Our approach has two stages based on compressed sensing reconstruction and deep learned quantitative inference. The reconstruction phase is convex and incorporates efficient spatiotemporal regularisations within an accelerated iterative shrinkage algorithm. This minimises the under-sampling (aliasing) artefacts from aggressively short scan times. The learned quantitative inference phase is purely trained on physical simulations (Bloch equations) that are flexible for producing rich training samples. We propose a deep and compact auto-encoder network with residual blocks in order to embed Bloch manifold projections through multiscale piecewise affine approximations, and to replace the nonscalable dictionary-matching baseline. Tested on a number of datasets we demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed scheme for recovering accurate and consistent quantitative information from novel and aggressively subsampled 2D/3D quantitative MRI acquisition protocols.",2020-01-23T17:15:42Z,2020-04-21T20:09:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08746v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08746v2,"cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.med-ph"

However, current digital holography technologies cannot recover the lossless phase information from a single interferogram. In this paper, we provide an entirely new approach for the full-field quantitative phase imaging technology. We demonstrate that deep learning can be used to replace the entitative phase shifter, and quantitative phase imaging can obtain quantitative phase from a single interferogram in in-line holography. A deep-phase-shift network (DPS-net) is reported, which can be trained with simulation training data. The trained DPS-net can be used to generate multiple interferograms with arbitrary phase shift from a single interferogram as an artificial intelligence phase shifter. The ability and the accuracy of generating arbitrary phase shifts are verified, and the performance of the proposed method is also verified by the experimental interferogram. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide a full digital phase shifter with high-accuracy for the technology of dynamic quantitative phase measurement.",2020-03-06T04:42:43Z,2020-03-06T04:42:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03027v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03027v1,"eess.IV, physics.optics"

As a first step, we focus on isothermal growth of an equiaxed grain in a supersaturated liquid in three dimensions. A quantitative phase-field formulation for solidification of a dilute binary alloy is used as the reference benchmark. We study the effect of numerical and modeling parameters in both needle-based and envelope-based approaches, in terms of their capacity to quantitatively reproduce phase-field reference results. In light of this benchmark, we discuss the capabilities and limitations of each approach in quantitatively and efficiently predicting transient and steady states of dendritic growth. We identify parameters that yield a good compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency in both needle-based and envelope-based models.

Quantitative Complementarity of Wave-Particle Duality,"Tai Hyun Yoon, Minhaeng Cho","To test the principle of complementarity and wave-particle duality quantitatively, we need a quantum composite system that can be controlled by experimental parameters. Here, we demonstrate that a double-path interferometer consisting of two parametric downconversion crystals seeded by coherent idler fields, where the generated coherent signal photons are used for quantum interference and the conjugate idler fields are used for which-path detectors with controllable fidelity, is useful for elucidating the quantitative complementarity. We show that the source purity $\mu_s$ is tightly bounded by the entanglement measure $E$ by the relation $\mu_s=\sqrt{1-E^2 }$ and the visibility $V$ and detector fidelity $F$ determine the coherence of the quantons, i.e., $C = V|F|$. The quantitative complementarity of the double-path interferometer we developed recently is explained in terms of the quanton-detector entanglement or quanton source purity that are expressed as functions of injected seed photon numbers. We further suggest that the experimental scheme utilizing two stimulated parametric downconversion processes is an ideal tool for investigating and understanding wave-particle duality and complementarity quantitatively.",2021-04-09T07:45:13Z,2021-04-16T04:12:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04230v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04230v2,"quant-ph, physics.optics"

Differences between image types are primarily due to the imaging modality and medical images utilize a wide range of physics based techniques while natural images are captured using only visible light. While many have demonstrated that SSL on medical images has resulted in better downstream task performance, our work suggests that more performance can be gained. The scientific principles which are used to acquire medical images are not often considered when constructing learning problems. For this reason, we propose incorporating quantitative imaging principles during generative SSL to improve image quality and quantitative biological accuracy. We show that this training schema results in better starting states for downstream supervised training on limited data.

Quantitative elemental imaging in eukaryotic algae,"Stefan Schmollinger, Si Chen, Sabeeha S. Merchant","All organisms, fundamentally, are made from the same raw material, namely the elements of the periodic table. Biochemical diversity is achieved with how these elements are utilized, for what purpose and in which physical location. Determining elemental distributions, especially those of trace elements that facilitate metabolism as cofactors in the active centers of essential enzymes, can determine the state of metabolism, the nutritional status or the developmental stage of an organism. Photosynthetic eukaryotes, especially algae, are excellent subjects for quantitative analysis of elemental distribution. These microbes utilize unique metabolic pathways that require various trace nutrients at their core to enable its operation. Photosynthetic microbes also have important environmental roles as primary producers in habitats with limited nutrient supply or toxin contaminations. Accordingly, photosynthetic eukaryotes are of great interest for biotechnological exploitation, carbon sequestration and bioremediation, with many of the applications involving various trace elements and consequently affecting their quota and intracellular distribution. A number of diverse applications were developed for elemental imaging allowing subcellular resolution, with X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) being at the forefront, enabling quantitative descriptions of intact cells in a non-destructive method.

Fundamental to our approach is the use of ideas from logic, particularly a careful analysis of the quantifier structure of probabilistic statements and the introduction of a number of abstract notions that represent stochastic convergence in a quantitative manner. In this sense, our work falls under the 'proof mining' program, and indeed, our quantitative results provide new examples of the phenomenon, recently made precise by the first author and Pischke, that many proofs in probability theory are proof-theoretically tame, and amenable to the extraction of quantitative data that is both of low complexity and independent of the underlying probability space.",2024-06-28T15:05:08Z,2024-08-02T10:25:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19979v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19979v2,"math.PR, math.LO, Primary: 03F10, 60G42, 03F03.

Our proof involves a metastable analogue of Doob's theorem for $L_1$-supermartingales along with a series of technical lemmas that make precise how quantitative information propagates through sums and products of stochastic processes. In this way, our paper establishes a general methodology for finding metastable bounds for stochastic processes that can be reduced to supermartingales, and therefore for obtaining quantitative convergence information across a broad class of stochastic algorithms whose convergence proof relies on some variation of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem.

A Selection Principle for the Sharp Quantitative Isoperimetric   Inequality,"Marco Cicalese, Gian Paolo Leonardi",We introduce a new variational method for the study of stability in the isoperimetric inequality. The method is quite general as it relies on a penalization technique combined with the regularity theory for quasiminimizers of the perimeter. Two applications are presented.

Second we positively answer to a conjecture by Hall concerning the best constant for the quantitative isoperimetric inequality in $R^2$ in the small asymmetry regime.,2010-07-22T14:44:43Z,2010-07-22T14:44:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3899v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.3899v1,"math.AP, math.OC, 52A40 (28A75, 49J45)"
Motion Parallax is Asymptotic to Binocular Disparity,Keith Stroyan,"Researchers especially beginning with (Rogers & Graham, 1982) have noticed important psychophysical and experimental similarities between the neurologically different motion parallax and stereopsis cues.

This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense that it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension to peripheral vision of (Cormac & Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central vision approximation for binocular disparity.

Exploring Classic Quantitative Strategies,Jun Lu,"The goal of this paper is to debunk and dispel the magic behind the black-box quantitative strategies. It aims to build a solid foundation on how and why the techniques work. This manuscript crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind the strategies. This tutorial doesn't shy away from addressing both the formal and informal aspects of quantitative strategies. By doing so, it hopes to provide readers with a deeper understanding of these techniques as well as the when, the how and the why of applying these techniques. The strategies are presented in terms of both S\&P500 and SH510300 data sets.

Quantitative approximate definable choices,"Antonio Lerario, Luca Rizzi, Daniele Tiberio","A definable choice is a semialgebraic selection of one point in every fiber of the projection of a semialgebraic set. Definable choices exist by semialgebraic triviality, but their complexity depends exponentially on the number of variables. By allowing the selection to be approximate (in the Hausdorff sense), we quantitatively improve this result. In particular, we construct an approximate selection with degree that is linear in the complexity of the original set, and independent on the number of variables. This work is motivated by infinite-dimensional applications, in particular to the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry. To prove these results, we develop a general quantitative theory for Hausdorff approximations in semialgebraic geometry, which has independent interest.",2024-09-23T10:07:24Z,2024-09-23T10:07:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14869v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14869v1,"math.AG, math.DG, math.MG, 14P10, 53C17"

Data visualization in political and social sciences,Andrei Zinovyev,"The basic objective of data visualization is to provide an efficient graphical display for summarizing and reasoning about quantitative information. During the last decades, political science has accumulated a large corpus of various kinds of data such as comprehensive factbooks and atlases, characterizing all or most of existing states by multiple and objectively assessed numerical indicators within certain time lapse. As a consequence, there exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a more quantitative scientific field and to use quantitative information in the analysis and reasoning. It is believed that any objective analysis in political science must be multidimensional and combine various sources of quantitative information; however, human capabilities for perception of large massifs of numerical information are limited. Hence, methods and approaches for visualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially multivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization approaches can be classified into several groups, starting from creating informative charts and diagrams (statistical graphics and infographics) and ending with advanced statistical methods for visualizing multidimensional tables containing both quantitative and qualitative information. In this article we provide a short review of existing methods of data visualization methods with applications in political and social science.",2010-08-06T13:29:11Z,2010-08-06T13:29:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1188v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1188v1,"cs.GR, cs.CE, cs.CY, 00A66, J.4"
Optimal Synthesis of Opacity-Enforcing Supervisors for Qualitative and   Quantitative Specifications,"Yifan Xie, Xiang Yin, Shaoyuan Li","In this paper, we investigate both qualitative and quantitative synthesis of optimal privacy-enforcing supervisors for partially-observed discrete-event systems. We consider a dynamic system whose information-flow is partially available to an intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer. We assume that the system has a ""secret"" that does not want to be revealed to the intruder. Our goal is to synthesize a supervisor that controls the system in a least-restrictive manner such that the closed-loop system meets the privacy requirement. For the qualitative case, we adopt the notion of infinite-step opacity as the privacy specification by requiring that the intruder can never determine for sure that the system is/was at a secret state for any specific instant. If the qualitative synthesis problem is not solvable or the synthesized solution is too restrictive, then we further investigate the quantitative synthesis problem so that the secret is revealed (if unavoidable) as late as possible. Effective algorithms are provided to solve both the qualitative and quantitative synthesis problems. Specifically, by building suitable information structures that involve information delays, we show that the optimal qualitative synthesis problem can be solved as a safety-game. The optimal quantitative synthesis problem can also be solved as an optimal total-cost control problem over an augmented information structure. Our work provides a complete solution to the standard infinite-step opacity control problem, which has not been solved without assumption on the relationship between controllable events and observable events. Furthermore, we generalize the opacity enforcement problem to the numerical setting by introducing the secret-revelation-time as a new quantitative measure.",2021-02-02T09:39:28Z,2021-02-02T09:39:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01402v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01402v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Quantitative Coding and Complexity Theory of Continuous Data,"Donghyun Lim, Martin Ziegler","Specifying a computational problem requires fixing encodings for input and output: encoding graphs as adjacency matrices, characters as integers, integers as bit strings, and vice versa. For such discrete data, the actual encoding is usually straightforward and/or complexity-theoretically inessential (up to polynomial time, say); but concerning continuous data, already real numbers naturally suggest various encodings (so-called REPRESENTATIONS) with very different properties, ranging from the computably 'unreasonable' binary expansion via qualitatively to polynomially and even linearly complexity-theoretically 'reasonable' signed-digit expansion. But how to distinguish between un/suitable encodings of other spaces common in Calculus and Numerics, such as Sobolev?   With respect to qualitative computability, Kreitz and Weihrauch (1985) had identified ADMISSIBILITY as crucial criterion for a representation over the Cantor space of infinite binary sequences to be 'reasonable'; cmp. [doi:10.1007/11780342_48]. Refining computability over topological to complexity over metric spaces, we develop the theory of POLYNOMIAL/LINEAR ADMISSIBILITY as two quantitative refinements of qualitative admissibility.   We also rephrase quantitative admissibility as quantitative continuity of both the representation and of its set-valued inverse, the latter adopting from [doi:10.4115/jla.2013.5.7] a new notion of 'sequential' continuity for multifunctions. By establishing a quantitative continuous selection theorem for multifunctions between compact ultrametric spaces, we can extend our above quantitative MAIN THEOREM from functions to multifunctions aka search problems. Higher-type complexity is captured by generalizing Cantor's (and Baire's) ground space for encodings to other (compact) ULRAmetric spaces.",2020-02-10T18:23:21Z,2021-08-24T10:17:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04005v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04005v5,"math.LO, cs.IT, cs.LO, math.IT, 03B70, F.4.1"
"Quantitative stability for eigenvalues of Schrödinger operator,   Quantitative bathtub principle \& Application to the turnpike property for a   bilinear optimal control problem","Idriss Mazari, Domenec Ruiz-Balet","This work is concerned with two optimisation problems that we tackle from a qualitative perspective. The first one deals with quantitative inequalities for spectral optimisation problems for Schr\""{o}dinger operators in general domains, the second one deals with the turnpike property for optimal bilinear control problems. In the first part of this article, we prove, under mild technical assumptions, quantitative inequalities for the optimisation of the first eigenvalue of $-\Delta-V$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions with respect to the potential $V$, under $L^\infty$ and $L^1$ constraints. This is done using a new method of proof which relies on in a crucial way on a quantitative bathtub principle. We believe our approach susceptible of being generalised to other steady elliptic optimisation problems. In the second part of this paper, we use this inequality to tackle a turnpike problem. Namely, considering a bilinear control system of the form $u_t-\Delta u=\mathcal V u$, $\mathcal V=\mathcal V(t,x)$ being the control, can we give qualitative information, under $L^\infty$ and $L^1$ constraints on $\mathcal V$, on the solutions of the optimisation problem $\sup \int_\Omega u(T,x)dx$? We prove that the quantitative inequality for eigenvalues implies an integral turnpike property: defining $\mathcal I^*$ as the set of optimal potentials for the eigenvalue optimisation problem and $\mathcal V_T^*$ as a solution of the bilinear optimal control problem, the quantity $\int_0^T \operatorname{dist}_{L^1}(\mathcal V_T^*(t,\cdot)\,, \mathcal I^*)^2$ is bounded uniformly in $T$.",2020-10-21T07:34:15Z,2020-10-21T07:34:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10798v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10798v1,"math.OC, math.AP, 49J15, 49Q10"
Quantitative Resilience of Linear Driftless Systems,"Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Kathleen Xu, Melkior Ornik","This paper introduces the notion of quantitative resilience of a control system. Following prior work, we study systems enduring a loss of control authority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target after a loss of control authority. However, after a malfunction a resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to its initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new concept of quantitative resilience. We define this metric as the maximal ratio of the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Na\""ive computation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a time-consuming task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on three novel geometric results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear optimization problem. We illustrate our method on two numerical examples: an opinion dynamics scenario and a trajectory controller for low-thrust spacecrafts.",2021-01-28T15:33:11Z,2021-02-18T18:30:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12063v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12063v3,"eess.SY, cs.SY, 93-06"

Quantitative Hennessy-Milner Theorems via Notions of Density,"Jonas Forster, Sergey Goncharov, Dirk Hofmann, Pedro Nora, Lutz Schröder, Paul Wild","The classical Hennessy-Milner theorem is an important tool in the analysis of concurrent processes; it guarantees that any two non-bisimilar states in finitely branching labelled transition systems can be distinguished by a modal formula. Numerous variants of this theorem have since been established for a wide range of logics and system types, including quantitative versions where lower bounds on behavioural distance (e.g.~in weighted, metric, or probabilistic transition systems) are witnessed by quantitative modal formulas. Both the qualitative and the quantitative versions have been accommodated within the framework of coalgebraic logic, with distances taking values in quantales, subject to certain restrictions, such as being so-called value quantales. While previous quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorems apply only to liftings of set functors to (pseudo-)metric spaces, in the present work we provide a quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorem that applies more widely to functors native to metric spaces; notably, we thus cover, for the first time, the well-known Hennessy-Milner theorem for continuous probabilistic transition systems, where transitions are given by Borel measures on metric spaces, as an instance. In the process, we also relax the restrictions imposed on the quantale, and additionally parametrize the technical account over notions of closure and, hence, density, providing associated variants of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem; this allows us to cover, for instance, behavioural ultrametrics.",2022-07-19T10:48:04Z,2022-08-30T11:09:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09187v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09187v2,"cs.LO, math.CT"
Multispectral Quantitative Phase Imaging Using a Diffractive Optical   Network,"Che-Yung Shen, Jingxi Li, Deniz Mengu, Aydogan Ozcan","As a label-free imaging technique, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides optical path length information of transparent specimens for various applications in biology, materials science, and engineering. Multispectral QPI measures quantitative phase information across multiple spectral bands, permitting the examination of wavelength-specific phase and dispersion characteristics of samples. Here, we present the design of a diffractive processor that can all-optically perform multispectral quantitative phase imaging of transparent phase-only objects in a snapshot. Our design utilizes spatially engineered diffractive layers, optimized through deep learning, to encode the phase profile of the input object at a predetermined set of wavelengths into spatial intensity variations at the output plane, allowing multispectral QPI using a monochrome focal plane array. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate diffractive multispectral processors to simultaneously perform quantitative phase imaging at 9 and 16 target spectral bands in the visible spectrum. These diffractive multispectral processors maintain uniform performance across all the wavelength channels, revealing a decent QPI performance at each target wavelength. The generalization of these diffractive processor designs is validated through numerical tests on unseen objects, including thin Pap smear images. Due to its all-optical processing capability using passive dielectric diffractive materials, this diffractive multispectral QPI processor offers a compact and power-efficient solution for high-throughput quantitative phase microscopy and spectroscopy. This framework can operate at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and be used for a wide range of phase imaging and sensing applications.",2023-08-05T21:13:25Z,2023-08-05T21:13:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02952v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02952v1,"physics.optics, cs.CV, physics.app-ph"
Statistical Barriers to Affine-equivariant Estimation,"Zihao Chen, Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri","We investigate the quantitative performance of affine-equivariant estimators for robust mean estimation. As a natural stability requirement, the construction of such affine-equivariant estimators has been extensively studied in the statistics literature. We quantitatively evaluate these estimators under two outlier models which have been the subject of much recent work: the heavy-tailed and adversarial corruption settings. We establish lower bounds which show that affine-equivariance induces a strict degradation in recovery error with quantitative rates degrading by a factor of $\sqrt{d}$ in both settings. We find that classical estimators such as the Tukey median (Tukey '75) and Stahel-Donoho estimator (Stahel '81 and Donoho '82) are either quantitatively sub-optimal even within the class of affine-equivariant estimators or lack any quantitative guarantees. On the other hand, recent estimators with strong quantitative guarantees are not affine-equivariant or require additional distributional assumptions to achieve it. We remedy this by constructing a new affine-equivariant estimator which nearly matches our lower bound. Our estimator is based on a novel notion of a high-dimensional median which may be of independent interest. Notably, our results are applicable more broadly to any estimator whose performance is evaluated in the Mahalanobis norm which, for affine-equivariant estimators, corresponds to an evaluation in Euclidean norm on isotropic distributions.",2023-10-16T18:42:00Z,2023-10-16T18:42:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10758v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10758v1,"math.ST, cs.DS, cs.LG, stat.TH"

Warfield, Moti Freiman","Quantitative analysis of pseudo-diffusion in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) data shows potential for assessing fetal lung maturation and generating valuable imaging biomarkers. Yet, the clinical utility of DWI data is hindered by unavoidable fetal motion during acquisition. We present IVIM-morph, a self-supervised deep neural network model for motion-corrected quantitative analysis of DWI data using the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model. IVIM-morph combines two sub-networks, a registration sub-network, and an IVIM model fitting sub-network, enabling simultaneous estimation of IVIM model parameters and motion. To promote physically plausible image registration, we introduce a biophysically informed loss function that effectively balances registration and model-fitting quality. We validated the efficacy of IVIM-morph by establishing a correlation between the predicted IVIM model parameters of the lung and gestational age (GA) using fetal DWI data of 39 subjects. IVIM-morph exhibited a notably improved correlation with gestational age (GA) when performing in-vivo quantitative analysis of fetal lung DWI data during the canalicular phase. IVIM-morph shows potential in developing valuable biomarkers for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung maturity with DWI data. Moreover, its adaptability opens the door to potential applications in other clinical contexts where motion compensation is essential for quantitative DWI analysis.

Metastability of life,V. I. Marchenko,The physical idea of the natural origin of diseases and deaths has been presented. The fundamental microscopical reason is the destruction of any metastable state by thermal activation of a nucleus of a nonreversable change. On the basis of this idea the quantitative theory of age dependence of death probability has been constructed. The obtained simple Death Laws are very accurately fulfilled almost for all known diseases.,1999-10-08T15:28:10Z,1999-10-08T15:28:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9910008v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9910008v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio"

Geometric isomorphism and minimum aberration for factorial designs with   quantitative factors,"Shao-Wei Cheng, Kenny Q. Ye","Factorial designs have broad applications in agricultural, engineering and scientific studies. In constructing and studying properties of factorial designs, traditional design theory treats all factors as nominal. However, this is not appropriate for experiments that involve quantitative factors. For designs with quantitative factors, level permutation of one or more factors in a design matrix could result in different geometric structures, and, thus, different design properties. In this paper indicator functions are introduced to represent factorial designs. A polynomial form of indicator functions is used to characterize the geometric structure of those designs. Geometric isomorphism is defined for classifying designs with quantitative factors. Based on indicator functions, a new aberration criteria is proposed and some minimum aberration designs are presented.",2005-03-29T12:28:09Z,2005-03-29T12:28:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0503678v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0503678v1,"math.ST, stat.TH, 62K15, 62K20.

In particular we will use this lattice to prove some results establishing order relation correspondences between the different quantitative approaches. The implications of these results w.r.t. recent work in the community is also investigated.

Developing classification indices for Chinese pulse diagnosis,"Jian-Jun Shu, Yuguang Sun","Aim: To develop classification criteria for Chinese pulse diagnosis and to objectify the ancient diagnostic technique. Methods: Chinese pulse curves are treated as wave signals. Multidimensional variable analysis is performed to provide the best curve fit between the recorded Chinese pulse waveforms and the collective Gamma density functions. Results: Chinese pulses can be recognized quantitatively by the newly-developed four classification indices, that is, the wave length, the relative phase difference, the rate parameter, and the peak ratio. The new quantitative classification not only reduces the dependency of pulse diagnosis on Chinese physician's experience, but also is able to interpret pathological wrist-pulse waveforms more precisely. Conclusions: Traditionally, Chinese physicians use fingertips to feel the wrist-pulses of patients in order to determine their health conditions. The qualitative theory of the Chinese pulse diagnosis is based on the experience of Chinese physicians for thousands of years. However, there are no quantitative theories to relate these different wrist-pulse waveforms to the health conditions of patients.

A CEGAR-like Approach for Cost LTL Bounds,"Maximilien Colange, Dimitri Racordon, Didier Buchs","Qualitative formal verification, that seeks boolean answers about the behavior of a system, is often insufficient for practical purposes. Observing quantitative information is of interest, e.g. for the proper calibration of a battery or a real-time scheduler. Historically, the focus has been on quantities in a continuous domain, but recent years showed a renewed interest for discrete quantitative domains.   Cost Linear Temporal Logic (CLTL) is a quantitative extension of classical LTL. It integrates into a nice theory developed in the past few years that extends the qualitative setting, with counterparts in terms of logics, automata and algebraic structure. We propose a practical usage of this logics for model-checking purposes. A CLTL formula defines a function from infinite words to integers. Finding the bounds of such a function over a given set of words can be seen as an extension of LTL universal and existential model-checking. We propose a CEGAR-like algorithm to find these bounds by relying on classical LTL model-checking, and use B\""{u}chi automata with counters to implement it.

Quantitative features allow a consistent and reproducible approach to EEG analysis, but only when all implementation aspects are clearly defined.   Methods: We detail quantitative features frequently used in neonatal EEG analysis and present a Matlab software package together with exact implementation details for all features. The feature set includes stationary features that capture amplitude and frequency characteristics and features of inter-hemispheric connectivity. The software, a Neonatal Eeg featURe set in mAtLab (NEURAL), is open source and freely available. The software also includes a pre-processing stage with a basic artefact removal procedure.

Atomic Layer deposition of 2D and 3D standards for quantitative   synchrotron-based composition and structural analysis methods,"Nicholas G.

These standards however can suffer from inhomogeneity in chemical composition and thickness and often require further calculations, based on sample mounting and detector geometry, to obtain quantitative results. These inhomogeneities negatively impact the reproducibility of the measurements and the quantitative measure itself. Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is an inexpensive, scalable deposition technique known for producing uniform, conformal films of a wide range of compounds on nearly any substrate material. These traits make it an ideal deposition method for producing films to replace the NIST standards and create SRM on a wide range of relevant 2D and 3D substrates.

Estimation of blood oxygenation with learned spectral decoloring for   quantitative photoacoustic imaging (LSD-qPAI),"Janek Gröhl, Thomas Kirchner, Tim Adler, Lena Maier-Hein","One of the main applications of photoacoustic (PA) imaging is the recovery of functional tissue properties, such as blood oxygenation (sO2). This is typically achieved by linear spectral unmixing of relevant chromophores from multispectral photoacoustic images. Despite the progress that has been made towards quantitative PA imaging (qPAI), most sO2 estimation methods yield poor results in realistic settings. In this work, we tackle the challenge by employing learned spectral decoloring for quantitative photoacoustic imaging (LSD-qPAI) to obtain quantitative estimates for blood oxygenation. LSD-qPAI computes sO2 directly from pixel-wise initial pressure spectra Sp0, which are vectors comprised of the initial pressure at the same spatial location over all recorded wavelengths. Initial results suggest that LSD-qPAI is able to obtain accurate sO2 estimates directly from multispectral photoacoustic measurements in silico and plausible estimates in vivo.",2019-02-15T15:15:11Z,2019-02-15T15:15:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05839v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05839v1,"physics.med-ph, cs.CV, cs.LG"
Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Systems Biology Models   Parameterized Using Qualitative Data,"Eshan D. Mitra, William S. Hlavacek","Motivation: Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of using non-numerical, qualitative data to parameterize mathematical models. However, uncertainty quantification (UQ) of such parameterized models has remained challenging because of a lack of a statistical interpretation of the objective functions used in optimization. Results: We formulated likelihood functions suitable for performing Bayesian UQ using qualitative data or a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. To demonstrate the resulting UQ capabilities, we analyzed a published model for IgE receptor signaling using synthetic qualitative and quantitative datasets. Remarkably, estimates of parameter values derived from the qualitative data were nearly as consistent with the assumed ground-truth parameter values as estimates derived from the lower throughput quantitative data. These results provide further motivation for leveraging qualitative data in biological modeling.

The proof relies on a structure of renormalization for the infinite percolation cluster introduced by Armstrong and the first author, Gaussian bounds on the heat kernel established by Barlow and tools of the theory of quantitative stochastic homogenization.

On Arnold's and Kazhdan's equidistribution problems,"Alexander Gorodnik, Amos Nevo","We consider isometric actions of lattices in semisimple algebraic groups on (possibly non-compact) homogeneous spaces with (possibly infinite) invariant Radon measure. We assume that the action has a dense orbit, and demonstrate two novel and non-classical dynamical phenomena that arise in this context. The first is the existence of a mean ergodic theorem even when the invariant measure is infinite, which implies the existence of an associated limiting distribution, possibly different than the invariant measure. The second is uniform quantitative equidistribution of all orbits in the space, which follows from a quantitative mean ergodic theorem for such actions. In turn, these results imply quantitative ratio ergodic theorems for isometric actions of lattices. This sheds some unexpected light on certain equidistribution problems posed by Arnol'd and also on the equidistribution conjecture for dense subgroups of isometries formulated by Kazhdan. We briefly describe the general problem regarding ergodic theorems for actions of lattices on homogeneous spaces and its solution via the duality principle \cite{GN2}, and give a number of examples to demonstrate our results. Finally, we also prove results on quantitative equidistribution for transitive actions.",2010-09-26T09:13:31Z,2010-09-26T09:13:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5076v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.5076v1,"math.DS, 22D40, 22E30"
Quantitative homogenization theory for random suspensions in steady   Stokes flow,"Mitia Duerinckx, Antoine Gloria","This work develops a quantitative homogenization theory for random suspensions of rigid particles in a steady Stokes flow, and completes recent qualitative results. More precisely, we establish a large-scale regularity theory for this Stokes problem, and we prove moment bounds for the associated correctors and optimal estimates on the homogenization error; the latter further requires a quantitative ergodicity assumption on the random suspension. Compared to the corresponding quantitative homogenization theory for divergence-form linear elliptic equations, substantial difficulties arise from the analysis of the fluid incompressibility and the particle rigidity constraints. Our analysis further applies to the problem of stiff inclusions in (compressible or incompressible) linear elasticity and in electrostatics; it is also new in those cases, even in the periodic setting.",2021-03-11T02:01:58Z,2021-03-11T02:01:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06414v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06414v1,"math.AP, math.PR, 35R60, 76M50, 35Q35, 76D03, 76D07"
Nested Weighted Automata,"Krishnendu Chatterjee, Thomas A. Henzinger, Jan Otop","Recently there has been a significant effort to handle quantitative properties in formal verification and synthesis. While weighted automata over finite and infinite words provide a natural and flexible framework to express quantitative properties, perhaps surprisingly, some basic system properties such as average response time cannot be expressed using weighted automata, nor in any other know decidable formalism. In this work, we introduce nested weighted automata as a natural extension of weighted automata which makes it possible to express important quantitative properties such as average response time. In nested weighted automata, a master automaton spins off and collects results from weighted slave automata, each of which computes a quantity along a finite portion of an infinite word. Nested weighted automata can be viewed as the quantitative analogue of monitor automata, which are used in run-time verification. We establish an almost complete decidability picture for the basic decision problems about nested weighted automata, and illustrate their applicability in several domains. In particular, nested weighted automata can be used to decide average response time properties.",2015-04-23T10:19:46Z,2015-04-23T10:19:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06117v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06117v1,"cs.FL, F.1.1; D.2.4"
Efficient inclusion of total variation type priors in quantitative   photoacoustic tomography,"Antti Hannukainen, Nuutti Hyvönen, Helle Majander, Tanja Tarvainen","Quantitative photoacoustic tomography is an emerging imaging technique aimed at estimating the distribution of optical parameters inside tissues from photoacoustic images, which are formed by combining optical information and ultrasonic propagation. This optical parameter estimation problem is ill-posed and needs to be approached within the framework of inverse problems. Photoacoustic images are three-dimensional and high-resolution. Furthermore, high-resolution reconstructions of the optical parameters are targeted. Therefore, in order to provide a practical method for quantitative photoacoustic tomography, the inversion algorithm needs to be able to perform successfully with problems of prominent size. In this work, an efficient approach for the inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is proposed, assuming an edge-preferring prior for the optical parameters. The method is based on iteratively combining priorconditioned LSQR with a lagged diffusivity step and a linearisation of the measurement model, with the needed multiplications by Jacobians performed in a matrix-free manner. The algorithm is tested with three-dimensional numerical simulations. The results show that the approach can be used to produce accurate and high quality estimates of absorption and diffusion in complex three-dimensional geometries with moderate computation time and cost.",2015-12-09T09:22:32Z,2016-06-01T15:10:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02796v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02796v2,"math.NA, 65N21, 35R30, 35Q60"
Berry-Esseen Theorem and Quantitative homogenization for the Random   Conductance Model with degenerate Conductances,"Sebastian Andres, Stefan Neukamm","We study the random conductance model on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, i.e. we consider a linear, finite-difference, divergence-form operator with random coefficients and the associated random walk under random conductances. We allow the conductances to be unbounded and degenerate elliptic, but they need to satisfy a strong moment condition and a quantified ergodicity assumption in form of a spectral gap estimate. As a main result we obtain in dimension $d\geq 3$ quantitative central limit theorems for the random walk in form of a Berry-Esseen estimate with speed $t^{-\frac 1 5+\varepsilon}$ for $d\geq 4$ and $t^{-\frac{1}{10}+\varepsilon}$ for $d=3$. Additionally, in the uniformly elliptic case in low dimensions $d=2,3$ we improve the rate in a quantitative Berry-Esseen theorem recently obtained by Mourrat. As a central analytic ingredient, for $d\geq 3$ we establish near-optimal decay estimates on the semigroup associated with the environment process.

Our new observation relies on noticing that rather than studying random walks, one can obtain more quantitative results by considering polynomial orbits of these group actions that are not contained in cosets of submodules of $\mathbb{Z}^r$ of small index.

Aim: A method for accurate and applicable real-time quantification of local sO$_2$ with PA imaging.   Approach: We combine multiple illumination (MI) sensing with learned spectral decoloring (LSD); training on Monte Carlo simulations of spectrally colored absorbed energy spectra, in order to apply the trained models to real PA measurements. We validate our combined MI-LSD method on a highly reliable, reproducible and easily scalable phantom model, based on copper and nickel sulfate solutions.   Results: With this sulfate model we see a consistently high estimation accuracy using MI-LSD, with median absolute estimation errors of 2.5 to 4.5 percentage points.

In particular, we can prove time-quantitative density even for aperiodic systems.

The bottleneck to implement this technique to extract quantitative information, is the need of more than two measurements for generating MS-QPI images. We propose a single-shot MS-QPI technique using highly spatially sensitive digital holographic microscope assisted with deep neural network (DNN). Our method first acquires the interferometric datasets corresponding to multiple wavelengths ({\lambda}=532, 633 and 808 nm used here). The acquired datasets are used to train generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate multi-spectral quantitative phase maps from a single input interferogram. The network is trained and validated on two different samples, the optical waveguide and a MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Further, validation of the framework is performed by comparing the predicted phase maps with experimentally acquired and processed multi-spectral phase maps.

Tropical Group Testing,"Hsin-Po Wang, Ryan Gabrys, Alexander Vardy","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. PCR amplifies the virus DNA 40 times to produce measurements of viral loads that span seven orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, the outputs of these tests are imprecise and therefore quantitative group testing methods, which rely on precise measurements, are not applicable. Motivated by the ever-increasing demand to identify individuals infected with SARS-CoV-19, we propose a new model that leverages tropical arithmetic to characterize the PCR testing process. Our proposed framework, termed tropical group testing, overcomes existing limitations of quantitative group testing by allowing for imprecise test measurements. In many cases, some of which are highlighted in this work, tropical group testing is provably more powerful than traditional binary group testing in that it require fewer tests than classical approaches, while additionally providing a mechanism to identify the viral load of each infected individual. It is also empirically stronger than related works that have attempted to combine PCR, quantitative group testing, and compressed sensing.",2022-01-12T21:45:45Z,2022-01-17T20:33:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05440v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05440v2,"q-bio.QM, stat.AP, 05B20, 15A80 (Primary)"

Uniformity criterion for designs with both qualitative and quantitative   factors,"Mei Zhang, Feng Yang, Yongdao Zhou","Experiments with both qualitative and quantitative factors occur frequently in practical applications. Many construction methods for this kind of designs, such as marginally coupled designs, were proposed to pursue some good space-filling structures. However, few criteria can be adapted to quantify the space-filling property of designs involving both qualitative and quantitative factors. As the uniformity is an important space-filling property of a design, in this paper, a new uniformity criterion, qualitative-quantitative discrepancy (QQD), is proposed for assessing the uniformity of designs with both types of factors. The closed form and lower bounds of the QQD are presented to calculate the exact QQD values of designs and recognize the uniform designs directly. In addition, a connection between the QQD and the balance pattern is derived, which not only helps to obtain a new lower bound but also provides a statistical justification of the QQD.

In this contribution we move forward to the nonlinear setting of monotone operators with $p$-growth. This work is dedicated to a quantitative two-scale expansion result. By treating the range of exponents $2\le p <\infty$ in dimensions $d\le 3$, we are able to consider genuinely nonlinear elliptic equations and systems such as $-\nabla \cdot A(x)(1+|\nabla u|^{p-2})\nabla u=f$ (with $A$ random, non-necessarily symmetric) for the first time. When going from $p=2$ to $p>2$, the main difficulty is to analyze the associated linearized operator, whose coefficients are degenerate, unbounded, and depend on the random input $A$ via the solution of a nonlinear equation. One of our main achievements is the control of this intricate nonlinear dependence, leading to annealed Meyers' estimates for the linearized operator, which are key to the optimal quantitative two-scale expansion result we derive (this is also new in the periodic setting).",2021-04-09T09:17:44Z,2023-05-10T23:29:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04263v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04263v4,"math.AP, math.PR, 47H05, 35B27, 35R60, 47H40"

To demonstrate this fact, we show that dTT can be used to capture compositional reasoning in presence of errors, since any program can be associated with a ""derivative"" relating errors in input with errors in output.

Despite the ubiquity of these approaches and the clear need for quantitative comparison of single cell datasets, t-SNE and UMAP have largely remained data visualisation tools due to the lack of robust statistical approaches available. Here, we have derived a statistical test for evaluating the difference between dimensionality-reduced datasets, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the distributions of cross entropy of single cells within each dataset. As the approach uses the interrelationship of single cells for comparison, the resulting statistic is robust and capable of distinguishing between true biological variation and rotational symmetry generation during dimensionality reduction.

Precision-medicine-toolbox: An open-source python package for   facilitation of quantitative medical imaging and radiomics analysis,"Sergey Primakov, Elizaveta Lavrova, Zohaib Salahuddin, Henry C Woodruff, Philippe Lambin","Medical image analysis plays a key role in precision medicine as it allows the clinicians to identify anatomical abnormalities and it is routinely used in clinical assessment. Data curation and pre-processing of medical images are critical steps in the quantitative medical image analysis that can have a significant impact on the resulting model performance. In this paper, we introduce a precision-medicine-toolbox that allows researchers to perform data curation, image pre-processing and handcrafted radiomics extraction (via Pyradiomics) and feature exploration tasks with Python.

Reconstructing data-driven governing equations for cell phenotypic   transitions: integration of data science and systems biology,Jianhua Xing,"Cells with the same genome can exist in different phenotypes. and can change between distinct phenotypes when subject to specific stimuli and microenvironments. Some examples include cell differentiation during development, reprogramming for induced pluripotent stem cells and transdifferentiation, cancer metastasis and fibrosis development. The regulation and dynamics of cell phenotypic conversion is a fundamental problem in biology, and has a long history of being studied within the formalism of dynamical systems. A main challenge for mechanism-driven modeling studies is acquiring sufficient amount of quantitative information for constraining model parameters. Advances in quantitative approaches, especially high throughput single-cell techniques, have accelerated the emergence of a new direction for reconstructing the governing dynamical equations of a cellular system from quantitative single-cell data, beyond the dominant statistical approaches.

Sofic approximations and quantitative measure couplings,Amandine Escalier,"Measure equivalence was introduced by Gromov as a measured analogue of quasi-isometry. Unlike the latter, measure equivalence does not preserve the large scale geometry of groups and happens to be very flexible in the amenable world. Indeed the Ornstein-Weiss theorem shows that all infinite countable amenable groups are measure equivalent to the group of integers. To refine this equivalence relation and make it responsive to geometry, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera introduced a quantitative version of measure equivalence. They also defined a relaxed version of this notion called quantitative measure subgroup coupling. In this article we offer to answer the inverse problem of the quantification (find a group admitting a measure subgroup coupling with a prescribed group with prescribed quantification) in the case of the lamplighter group.",2022-05-24T15:14:02Z,2024-03-11T14:12:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12137v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12137v2,"math.GR, math.DS, 37A20"
Variable-Depth Simulation of Most Permissive Boolean Networks,"Théo Roncalli, Loïc Paulevé","In systems biology, Boolean networks (BNs) aim at modeling the qualitative dynamics of quantitative biological systems. Contrary to their (a)synchronous interpretations, the Most Permissive (MP) interpretation guarantees capturing all the trajectories of any quantitative system compatible with the BN, without additional parameters. Notably, the MP mode has the ability to capture transitions related to the heterogeneity of time scales and concentration scales in the abstracted quantitative system and which are not captured by asynchronous modes. So far, the analysis of MPBNs has focused on Boolean dynamical properties, such as the existence of particular trajectories or attractors. This paper addresses the sampling of trajectories from MPBNs in order to quantify the propensities of attractors reachable from a given initial BN configuration. The computation of MP transitions from a configuration is performed by iteratively discovering possible state changes. The number of iterations is referred to as the permissive depth, where the first depth corresponds to the asynchronous transitions. This permissive depth reflects the potential concentration and time scales heterogeneity along the abstracted quantitative process. The simulation of MPBNs is illustrated on several models from the literature, on which the depth parametrization can help to assess the robustness of predictions on attractor propensities changes triggered by model perturbations.",2022-06-25T20:41:10Z,2022-06-25T20:41:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12729v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12729v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Within this context, reinforcement learning (RL), which operates on a reward-centric mechanism for optimal control, has surfaced as a potentially effective solution to the intricate financial decision-making conundrums presented. This paper delves into the fusion of two established financial trading strategies, namely the constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) and the time-invariant portfolio protection (TIPP), with the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework. As a result, we introduce two novel multi-agent RL (MARL) methods, CPPI-MADDPG and TIPP-MADDPG, tailored for probing strategic trading within quantitative markets. To validate these innovations, we implemented them on a diverse selection of 100 real-market shares.

Effective design and development of a cyber resilient system requires experimental methods and tools for quantitative measuring of cyber resilience. This paper describes an experimental method and test bed for obtaining resilience-relevant data as a system (in our case -- a truck) traverses its route, in repeatable, systematic experiments. We model a truck equipped with an autonomous cyber-defense system and which also includes inherent physical resilience features. When attacked by malware, this ensemble of cyber-physical features (i.e., ""bonware"") strives to resist and recover from the performance degradation caused by the malware's attack.

This is referred to as quantitative imaging, i.e, correct recovery of physical parameters and not just a qualitative image. In this chapter, we aim to give an overview on established reconstruction techniques in photoacoustic tomography. We start with modelling of the optical and acoustic phenomena, necessary for a reliable recovery of quantitative values.

In quantitative MRI, the physical model of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry is known, providing additional prior knowledge for image reconstruction. However, traditional reconstruction networks are limited to learning the spatial domain prior knowledge, ignoring the relaxometry prior. Therefore, we propose a relaxometry-guided quantitative MRI reconstruction framework to learn the spatial prior from data and the relaxometry prior from MRI physics.

A scaling law in optomechanically induced nonlinear oscillation,"Han Xiao Zhang, Vitalie Eremeev, Jinhui Wu, Miguel Orszag, Bing He","Stable limit cycle as a stabilized mechanical oscillation is the primary result of the dynamical evolution of an optomechanical system under sufficiently powerful pump. Because this dynamical process is highly nonlinear, it was not clear whether there exists a quantitative law to relate an evolved mechanical oscillation (the limit cycle of the dynamical process) to the given parameters of the fabricated system. Here, by means of the numerical simulations based on nonlinear dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of such quantitative relations that are generally valid to the nonlinear optomechanical processes. These quantitative relations can be summarized to a scaling law that is seemingly similar to those in phase transitions of many-body systems but has very different properties.

However, it becomes challenging when trying to identify representative patterns in quantitative databases, especially with large datasets, as enumeration-based strategies struggle due to the vast search space involved. To tackle this challenge, output space sampling methods have emerged as a promising solution thanks to its ability to discover valuable patterns with reduced computational overhead. However, existing sampling methods often encounter limitations when dealing with large quantitative database, resulting in scalability-related challenges. In this work, we propose a novel high utility pattern sampling algorithm and its on-disk version both designed for large quantitative databases based on two original theorems. Our approach ensures both the interactivity required for user-centered methods and strong statistical guarantees through random sampling. Thanks to our method, users can instantly discover relevant and representative utility pattern, facilitating efficient exploration of the database within seconds.

Contrast-Optimized Basis Functions for Self-Navigated Motion Correction   in Quantitative MRI,"Elisa Marchetto, Sebastian Flassbeck, Andrew Mao, Jakob Assländer","Purpose: The long scan times of quantitative MRI techniques make motion artifacts more likely. For MR-Fingerprinting-like approaches, this problem can be addressed with self-navigated retrospective motion correction based on reconstructions in a singular value decomposition (SVD) subspace. However, the SVD promotes high signal intensity in all tissues, which limits the contrast between tissue types and ultimately reduces the accuracy of registration. The purpose of this paper is to rotate the subspace for maximum contrast between two types of tissue and improve the accuracy of motion estimates.   Methods: A subspace is derived that promotes contrasts between brain parenchyma and CSF, achieved through the generalized eigendecomposition of mean autocorrelation matrices, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process to maintain orthogonality. We tested our motion correction method on 85 scans with varying motion levels, acquired with a 3D hybrid-state sequence optimized for quantitative magnetization transfer imaging.   Results: A comparative analysis shows that the contrast-optimized basis significantly improve the parenchyma-CSF contrast, leading to smoother motion estimates and reduced artifacts in the quantitative maps.

Characteristic Logics for Behavioural Hemimetrics via Fuzzy Lax   Extensions,"Paul Wild, Lutz Schröder","In systems involving quantitative data, such as probabilistic, fuzzy, or metric systems, behavioural distances provide a more fine-grained comparison of states than two-valued notions of behavioural equivalence or behaviour inclusion. Like in the two-valued case, the wide variation found in system types creates a need for generic methods that apply to many system types at once. Approaches of this kind are emerging within the paradigm of universal coalgebra, based either on lifting pseudometrics along set functors or on lifting general real-valued (fuzzy) relations along functors by means of fuzzy lax extensions. An immediate benefit of the latter is that they allow bounding behavioural distance by means of fuzzy (bi-)simulations that need not themselves be hemi- or pseudometrics; this is analogous to classical simulations and bisimulations, which need not be preorders or equivalence relations, respectively. The known generic pseudometric liftings, specifically the generic Kantorovich and Wasserstein liftings, both can be extended to yield fuzzy lax extensions, using the fact that both are effectively given by a choice of quantitative modalities. Our central result then shows that in fact all fuzzy lax extensions are Kantorovich extensions for a suitable set of quantitative modalities, the so-called Moss modalities. For nonexpansive fuzzy lax extensions, this allows for the extraction of quantitative modal logics that characterize behavioural distance, i.e. satisfy a quantitative version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem; equivalently, we obtain expressiveness of a quantitative version of Moss' coalgebraic logic. All our results explicitly hold also for asymmetric distances (hemimetrics), i.e. notions of quantitative simulation.",2020-07-02T11:40:03Z,2022-06-14T14:39:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01033v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01033v6,"cs.LO, 68Q85, 03B45, 03B52, F.4.1; I.2.4"
Severity Assessment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Using   Quantitative Features from Chest CT Images,"Zhenyu Tang, Wei Zhao, Xingzhi Xie, Zheng Zhong, Feng Shi, Jun Liu, Dinggang Shen","Background: Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left lung.

Reconstructing Quantitative Cerebral Perfusion Images Directly From   Measured Sinogram Data Acquired Using C-arm Cone-Beam CT,"Haotian Zhao, Ruifeng Chen, Jing Yan, Juan Feng, Jun Xiang, Yang Chen, Dong Liang, Yinsheng Li","To shorten the door-to-puncture time for better treating patients with acute ischemic stroke, it is highly desired to obtain quantitative cerebral perfusion images using C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) equipped in the interventional suite. However, limited by the slow gantry rotation speed, the temporal resolution and temporal sampling density of typical C-arm CBCT are much poorer than those of multi-detector-row CT in the diagnostic imaging suite. The current quantitative perfusion imaging includes two cascaded steps: time-resolved image reconstruction and perfusion parametric estimation. For time-resolved image reconstruction, the technical challenge imposed by poor temporal resolution and poor sampling density causes inaccurate quantification of the temporal variation of cerebral artery and tissue attenuation values. For perfusion parametric estimation, it remains a technical challenge to appropriately design the handcrafted regularization for better solving the associated deconvolution problem. These two challenges together prevent obtaining quantitatively accurate perfusion images using C-arm CBCT. The purpose of this work is to simultaneously address these two challenges by combining the two cascaded steps into a single joint optimization problem and reconstructing quantitative perfusion images directly from the measured sinogram data. In the developed direct cerebral perfusion parametric image reconstruction technique, TRAINER in short, the quantitative perfusion images have been represented as a subject-specific conditional generative model trained under the constraint of the time-resolved CT forward model, perfusion convolutional model, and the subject's own measured sinogram data. Results shown in this paper demonstrated that using TRAINER, quantitative cerebral perfusion images can be accurately obtained using C-arm CBCT in the interventional suite.",2024-12-06T14:42:50Z,2024-12-25T02:12:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05084v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05084v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV, physics.med-ph"
Probabilistic Constraint Logic Programming. Formal Foundations of   Quantitative and Statistical Inference in Constraint-Based Natural Language   Processing,Stefan Riezler,"In this thesis, we present two approaches to a rigorous mathematical and algorithmic foundation of quantitative and statistical inference in constraint-based natural language processing. The first approach, called quantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical framework, and presents a sound and complete system of quantitative inference for definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines a rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective weights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The second approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces a log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic program and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and properties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., unparsed data. The possibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties of the log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate parameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary context-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these ideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the correct parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we address the problem of computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in the inference task and present various techniques to approximately solve this task. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching for the most probable analysis in probabilistic constraint logic programs.",2000-08-30T13:57:19Z,2000-08-30T13:57:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0008036v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0008036v1,"cs.CL, I.2.6; I.2.7"
Quantifying the implicit process flow abstraction in SBGN-PD diagrams   with Bio-PEPA,"Laurence Loewe, Stuart Moodie, Jane Hillston","For a long time biologists have used visual representations of biochemical networks to gain a quick overview of important structural properties. Recently SBGN, the Systems Biology Graphical Notation, has been developed to standardise the way in which such graphical maps are drawn in order to facilitate the exchange of information. Its qualitative Process Diagrams (SBGN-PD) are based on an implicit Process Flow Abstraction (PFA) that can also be used to construct quantitative representations, which can be used for automated analyses of the system. Here we explicitly describe the PFA that underpins SBGN-PD and define attributes for SBGN-PD glyphs that make it possible to capture the quantitative details of a biochemical reaction network. We implemented SBGNtext2BioPEPA, a tool that demonstrates how such quantitative details can be used to automatically generate working Bio-PEPA code from a textual representation of SBGN-PD that we developed. Bio-PEPA is a process algebra that was designed for implementing quantitative models of concurrent biochemical reaction systems. We use this approach to compute the expected delay between input and output using deterministic and stochastic simulations of the MAPK signal transduction cascade. The scheme developed here is general and can be easily adapted to other output formalisms.",2009-10-08T05:10:21Z,2009-10-08T05:10:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1410v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.1410v1,"cs.PL, cs.CE, q-bio.QM"

This article reports on the development and validation of the Quantitative Reasoning for College Science (QuaRCS) Assessment, a numeracy assessment instrument designed for college-level general education science students. It has been administered to more than four thousand students over eight semesters of refinement. We show that the QuaRCS is able to distinguish varying levels of quantitative literacy and present performance statistics for both individual items and the instrument as a whole. Responses from a survey of forty-eight Astronomy and Mathematics educators show that these two groups share views regarding which quantitative skills are most important in the contexts of science literacy and educated citizenship, and the skills assessed with the QuaRCS are drawn from these rankings.

A van Benthem Theorem for Quantitative Probabilistic Modal Logic,"Paul Wild, Lutz Schröder, Dirk Pattinson, Barbara König","In probabilistic transition systems, behavioural metrics provide a more fine-grained and stable measure of system equivalence than crisp notions of bisimilarity. They correlate strongly to quantitative probabilistic logics, and in fact the distance induced by a probabilistic modal logic taking values in the real unit interval has been shown to coincide with behavioural distance. For probabilistic systems, probabilistic modal logic thus plays an analogous role to that of Hennessy-Milner logic on classical labelled transition systems. In the quantitative setting, invariance of modal logic under bisimilarity becomes non-expansivity of formula evaluation w.r.t. behavioural distance. In the present paper, we provide a characterization of the expressive power of probabilistic modal logic based on this observation: We prove a probabilistic analogue of the classical van Benthem theorem, which states that modal logic is precisely the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic. Specifically, we show that quantitative probabilistic modal logic lies dense in the bisimulation-invariant fragment, in the indicated sense of non-expansive formula evaluation, of quantitative probabilistic first-order logic; more precisely, bisimulation-invariant first-order formulas are approximable by modal formulas of bounded rank.

Quantitative phase microscopy spatial signatures of cancer cells,"Darina Roitshtain, Lauren Wolbromsky, Evgeny Bal, Hayit Greenspan, Lisa L. Satterwhite, Natan T. Shaked","We present cytometric classification of live healthy and cancer cells by using the spatial morphological and textural information found in the label-free quantitative phase images of the cells. We compare both healthy cells to primary tumor cell and primary tumor cells to metastatic cancer cells, where tumor biopsies and normal tissues were isolated from the same individuals. To mimic analysis of liquid biopsies by flow cytometry, the cells were imaged while unattached to the substrate. We used low-coherence off-axis interferometric phase microscopy setup, which allows a single-exposure acquisition mode, and thus is suitable for quantitative imaging of dynamic cells during flow. After acquisition, the optical path delay maps of the cells were extracted, and used to calculate 15 parameters derived from cellular 3-D morphology and texture. Upon analyzing tens of cells in each group, we found high statistical significance in the difference between the groups in most of the parameters calculated, with the same trends for all statistically significant parameters. Furthermore, a specially designed machine learning algorithm, implemented on the phase map extracted features, classified the correct cell type (healthy/cancer/metastatic) with 81%-93% sensitivity and 81%-99% specificity. The quantitative phase imaging approach for liquid biopsies presented in this paper could be the basis for advanced techniques of staging freshly isolated live cancer cells in imaging flow cytometers.",2019-04-02T14:27:04Z,2019-04-02T14:27:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00997v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00997v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.TO"
A sharp quantitative version of Alexandrov's theorem via the method of   moving planes,"Giulio Ciraolo, Luigi Vezzoni","We prove the following quantitative version of the celebrated Soap Bubble Theorem of Alexandrov. Let $S$ be a $C^2$ closed embedded hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n\geq1$, and denote by $osc(H)$ the oscillation of its mean curvature. We prove that there exists a positive $\varepsilon$, depending on $n$ and upper bounds on the area and the $C^2$-regularity of $S$, such that if $osc(H) \leq \varepsilon$ then there exist two concentric balls $B_{r_i}$ and $B_{r_e}$ such that $S \subset \overline{B}_{r_e} \setminus B_{r_i}$ and $r_e -r_i \leq C \, osc(H)$, with $C$ depending only on $n$ and upper bounds on the surface area of $S$ and the $C^2$ regularity of $S$. Our approach is based on a quantitative study of the method of moving planes and the quantitative estimate on $r_e-r_i$ we obtain is optimal.   As a consequence of this theorem, we also prove that if $osc(H)$ is small then $S$ is diffeomorphic to a sphere and give a quantitative bound which implies that $S$ is $C^1$-close to a sphere.",2015-01-30T17:05:25Z,2016-01-11T21:47:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07845v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07845v3,"math.DG, math.AP, 53C20, 53C21 (Primary), 35B50, 35B51 (Secondary)"
A Quantitative Understanding of Pattern Matching,"Sandra Alves, Delia Kesner, Daniel Ventura","This paper shows that the recent approach to quantitative typing systems for programming languages can be extended to pattern matching features. Indeed, we define two resource aware type systems, named U and E, for a lambda-calculus equipped with pairs for both patterns and terms. Our typing systems borrow some basic ideas from [BKRDR15], which characterises (head) normalisation in a qualitative way, in the sense that typability and normalisation coincide. But in contrast to [BKRDR15], our (static) systems also provides quantitative information about the dynamics of the calculus. Indeed, system U provides upper bounds for the length of normalisation sequences plus the size of their corresponding normal forms, while system E, which can be seen as a refinement of system U, produces exact bounds for each of them. This is achieved by means of a non-idempotent intersection type system equipped with different technical tools. First of all, we use product types to type pairs, instead of the disjoint unions in [BKRDR15], thus avoiding an overlap between ""being a pair"" and ""being duplicable"", resulting in an essential tool to reason about quantitativity. Secondly, typing sequents in system E are decorated with tuples of integers, which provide quantitative information about normalisation sequences, notably time (c.f. length) and space (c.f. size). Another key tool of system E is that the type system distinguishes between consuming (contributing to time) and persistent (contributing to space) constructors. Moreover, the time resource information is remarkably refined, because it discriminates between different kinds of reduction steps performed during evaluation, so that beta reduction, substitution and matching steps are counted separately.",2019-12-04T11:54:15Z,2019-12-04T11:54:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01914v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01914v1,"cs.LO, cs.PL, 03B70, 03B15, 68Q05, 03D10"
Uncertainty Analysis of Stray Field Measurements by Quantitative   Magnetic Force Microscopy,"Xiukun Hu, Gaoliang Dai, Sibylle Sievers, Alexander Fernández Scarioni, Volker Neu, Mark Bieler, Hans Werner Schumacher","Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements generally provide phase images which represent the signature of domain structures on the surface of nanomaterials. To quantitatively determine magnetic stray fields based on an MFM image requires calibrated properties of the magnetic tip. In this work, an approach is presented for calibrating a magnetic tip using a Co/Pt multilayered film as a reference sample which shows stable well-known magnetic properties and well-defined perpendicular band domains. The approach is based on a regularized deconvolution process in Fourier domain with a Wiener filter and the L-curve method for determining a suitable regularization parameter to get a physically reasonable result. The calibrated tip is applied for a traceable quantitative determination of the stray fields of a test sample which has a patial frequency spectrum covered by that of the reference sample. According to the ""Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement"", uncertainties of the processing algorithm are estimated considering the fact that the regularization influences significantly the quantitative analysis. We discuss relevant uncertainty components and their propagations between real domain and Fourier domain for both, the tip calibration procedure and the stray field calculation, and propose an uncertainty evaluation procedure for quantitative magnetic force microscopy.",2019-12-18T08:10:11Z,2020-02-19T09:14:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08437v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08437v2,"physics.data-an, cond-mat.mes-hall, 00A79"

Price, Kai Chen, Akshay Rao","Optical pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the study of non-equilibrium electronic dynamics and finds wide applications across a range of fields, from physics and chemistry to material science and biology. However, a shortcoming of conventional pump-probe spectroscopy is that photoinduced changes in transmission, reflection and scattering can simultaneously contribute to the measured differential spectra, leading to ambiguities in assigning the origin of spectral signatures and ruling out quantitative interpretation of the spectra. Ideally, these methods would measure the underlying dielectric function (or the complex refractive index) which would then directly provide quantitative information on the transient excited state dynamics free of these ambiguities. Here we present and test a model independent route to transform differential transmission or reflection spectra, measured via conventional optical pump-probe spectroscopy, to changes in the quantitative transient dielectric function. We benchmark this method against changes in the real refractive index measured using time-resolved Frequency Domain Interferometry in prototypical inorganic and organic semiconductor films. Our methodology can be applied to existing and future pump-probe data sets, allowing for an unambiguous and quantitative characterisation of the transient photoexcited spectra of materials. This in turn will accelerate the adoption of pump-probe spectroscopy as a facile and robust materials characterisation and screening tool.",2021-08-24T09:41:22Z,2021-08-24T09:41:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10605v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10605v1,"physics.app-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Quantitative Resilience of Generalized Integrators,"Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Kathleen Xu, Melkior Ornik","To design critical systems engineers must be able to prove that their system can continue with its mission even after losing control authority over some of its actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target after a partial loss of control authority. However, after such a malfunction, a resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to its initial capabilities. To quantify this loss of performance we introduce the notion of quantitative resilience as the maximal ratio of the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Naive computation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a complex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience of control systems with multiple integrators and nonsymmetric input sets. Relying on control theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a linear optimization problem. We illustrate our method on two numerical examples: a trajectory controller for low-thrust spacecrafts and a UAV with eight propellers.",2021-11-07T19:51:49Z,2023-04-05T17:27:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04163v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04163v3,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Quantitative stability of harmonic maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to   $\mathbb{S}^2$ with higher degree,"Bin Deng, Liming Sun, Juncheng Wei","For degree $\pm 1$ harmonic maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ (or $\mathbb{S}^2$) to $\mathbb{S}^2$, Bernand-Mantel, Muratov and Simon \cite{bernand2021quantitative} recently establish a uniformly quantitative stability estimate. Namely, for any map $u:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$ with degree $\pm 1$, the discrepancy of its Dirichlet energy and $4\pi$ can linearly control the $\dot H^1$-difference of $u$ from the set of degree $\pm 1$ harmonic maps. Whether a similar estimate holds for harmonic maps with higher degree is unknown. In this paper, we prove that a similar quantitative stability result for higher degree is true only in local sense. Namely, given a harmonic map, a similar estimate holds if $u$ is already sufficiently near to it (modulo M\""{o}bius transform) and the bound in general depends on the given harmonic map. More importantly, we investigate an example of degree 2 case thoroughly, which shows that it fails to have a uniformly quantitative estimate like the degree $\pm 1$ case. This phenomenon show the striking difference of degree $\pm1$ ones and higher degree ones. Finally, we also conjecture a new uniformly quantitative stability estimate based on our computation.",2021-11-15T09:35:02Z,2024-04-15T11:05:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07630v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07630v2,"math.AP, math.DG, 58E20, 35B35, 35B38"
Rapid 3D Multiparametric Mapping of Brain Metastases with Deep   Learning-Based Phase-Sensitive MR Fingerprinting,"Victoria Y. Yu, Kathryn R. Tringale, Ricardo Otazo, Ouri Cohen","In MR fingerprinting (MRF) reconstruction, measured data is pattern-matched to simulated signals to extract quantitative tissue parameters. A critical drawback to this approach is the exponentially increasing compute time for mapping of multiple parameters. Previously, a deep learning (DL) reconstruction method called DRONE was shown to overcome this constraint by mapping the magnitude time-series signal to the underlying tissue parameters. However, relaxometry from magnitude images is susceptible to errors arising from ambiguities in the zero crossing of the signal or the non-zero noise mean. The aim of this study is to develop rapid acquisition and quantification methods to enable accurate multiparametric tissue mapping from complex data. An optimized EPI based MRF sequence is developed along with a novel phasesensitive DL quantification allowing the use of real-valued neural networks to reconstruct complex measured data and providing an additional quantitative map of the phase. Phantom experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. A comparison to previous DRONE methods in a healthy subject shows improved fidelity to known T1 and T2 values for the phase-sensitive approach. By processing the estimated phase map with conventional quantitative susceptibility mapping algorithms, we demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous quantification of proton density, T1, T2, transmitter B1+ field and the quantitative susceptibility maps.

Scientometric engineering: Exploring citation dynamics via arXiv eprints,Keisuke Okamura,"Scholarly communications have been rapidly integrated into digitised and networked open ecosystems, where preprint servers have played a pivotal role in accelerating the knowledge transfer processes. However, quantitative evidence is scarce regarding how this paradigm shift beyond the traditional journal publication system has affected the dynamics of collective attention on science. To address this issue, we investigate the citation data of more than 1.5 million eprints on arXiv (https://arxiv.org/) and analyse the long-term citation trend for each discipline involved. We find that the typical growth and obsolescence patterns vary across disciplines, reflecting different publication and communication practices. The results provide unique evidence on the attention dynamics shaped by the research community today, including the dramatic growth and fast obsolescence of Computer Science eprints, which has not been captured in previous studies relying on the citation data of journal papers. Subsequently, we develop a quantitatively-and-temporally normalised citation index with an approximately normal distribution, which is useful for comparing citational attention across disciplines and time periods. Further, we derive a stochastic model consistent with the observed quantitative and temporal characteristics of citation growth and obsolescence. The findings and the developed framework open a new avenue for understanding the nature of citation dynamics.",2021-06-09T12:38:44Z,2022-02-05T09:13:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05027v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05027v2,"cs.DL, cs.CY, cs.SI, physics.soc-ph, stat.AP"
Quantitative Equality in Substructural Logic via Lipschitz Doctrines,"Francesco Dagnino, Fabio Pasquali","Substructural logics naturally support a quantitative interpretation of formulas, as they are seen as consumable resources. Distances are the quantitative counterpart of equivalence relations: they measure how much two objects are similar, rather than just saying whether they are equivalent or not. Hence, they provide the natural choice for modelling equality in a substructural setting. In this paper, we develop this idea, using the categorical language of Lawvere's doctrines. We work in a minimal fragment of Linear Logic enriched by graded modalities, which are needed to write a resource sensitive substitution rule for equality, enabling its quantitative interpretation as a distance. We introduce both a deductive calculus and the notion of Lipschitz doctrine to give it a sound and complete categorical semantics. The study of 2-categorical properties of Lipschitz doctrines provides us with a universal construction, which generates examples based for instance on metric spaces and quantitative realisability. Finally, we show how to smoothly extend our results to richer substructural logics, up to full Linear Logic with quantifiers.",2021-10-11T16:25:28Z,2025-01-28T17:41:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05388v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05388v5,"cs.LO, math.CT"
Integrating Testing and Operation-related Quantitative Evidences in   Assurance Cases to Argue Safety of Data-Driven AI/ML Components,"Michael Kläs, Lisa Jöckel, Rasmus Adler, Jan Reich","In the future, AI will increasingly find its way into systems that can potentially cause physical harm to humans. For such safety-critical systems, it must be demonstrated that their residual risk does not exceed what is acceptable. This includes, in particular, the AI components that are part of such systems' safety-related functions. Assurance cases are an intensively discussed option today for specifying a sound and comprehensive safety argument to demonstrate a system's safety. In previous work, it has been suggested to argue safety for AI components by structuring assurance cases based on two complementary risk acceptance criteria. One of these criteria is used to derive quantitative targets regarding the AI. The argumentation structures commonly proposed to show the achievement of such quantitative targets, however, focus on failure rates from statistical testing. Further important aspects are only considered in a qualitative manner -- if at all. In contrast, this paper proposes a more holistic argumentation structure for having achieved the target, namely a structure that integrates test results with runtime aspects and the impact of scope compliance and test data quality in a quantitative manner. We elaborate different argumentation options, present the underlying mathematical considerations, and discuss resulting implications for their practical application. Using the proposed argumentation structure might not only increase the integrity of assurance cases but may also allow claims on quantitative targets that would not be justifiable otherwise.",2022-02-10T20:35:25Z,2022-02-10T20:35:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05313v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05313v1,"cs.AI, cs.SE, G.3; D.2.5"
Kantorovich Functors and Characteristic Logics for Behavioural Distances,"Sergey Goncharov, Dirk Hofmann, Pedro Nora, Lutz Schröder, Paul Wild","Behavioural distances measure the deviation between states in quantitative systems, such as probabilistic or weighted systems. There is growing interest in generic approaches to behavioural distances. In particular, coalgebraic methods capture variations in the system type (nondeterministic, probabilistic, game-based etc.), and the notion of quantale abstracts over the actual values distances take, thus covering, e.g., two-valued equivalences, (pseudo-)metrics, and probabilistic (pseudo-)metrics. Coalgebraic behavioural distances have been based either on liftings of SET-functors to categories of metric spaces, or on lax extensions of SET-functors to categories of quantitative relations. Every lax extension induces a functor lifting but not every lifting comes from a lax extension. It was shown recently that every lax extension is Kantorovich, i.e. induced by a suitable choice of monotone predicate liftings, implying via a quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorem that behavioural distances induced by lax extensions can be characterized by quantitative modal logics. Here, we essentially show the same in the more general setting of behavioural distances induced by functor liftings. In particular, we show that every functor lifting, and indeed every functor on (quantale-valued) metric spaces, that preserves isometries is Kantorovich, so that the induced behavioural distance (on systems of suitably restricted branching degree) can be characterized by a quantitative modal logic.",2022-02-14T22:28:23Z,2023-05-02T15:56:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07069v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07069v3,"math.CT, cs.LO"

Quantitative Graded Semantics and Spectra of Behavioural Metrics,"Jonas Forster, Lutz Schröder, Paul Wild, Harsh Beohar, Sebastian Gurke, Barbara König, Karla Messing","Behavioural metrics provide a quantitative refinement of classical two-valued behavioural equivalences on systems with quantitative data, such as metric or probabilistic transition systems. In analogy to the linear-time/branching-time spectrum of two-valued behavioural equivalences on transition systems, behavioural metrics vary in granularity, and are often characterized by fragments of suitable modal logics. In the latter respect, the quantitative case is, however, more involved than the two-valued one; in fact, we show that probabilistic metric trace distance cannot be characterized by any compositionally defined modal logic with unary modalities. We go on to provide a unifying treatment of spectra of behavioural metrics in the emerging framework of graded monads, working in coalgebraic generality, that is, parametrically in the system type. In the ensuing development of quantitative graded semantics, we introduce algebraic presentations of graded monads on the category of metric spaces. Moreover, we provide a general criterion for a given real-valued modal logic to characterize a given behavioural distance. As a case study, we apply this criterion to obtain a new characteristic modal logic for trace distance in fuzzy metric transition systems.",2023-06-02T12:23:29Z,2025-01-27T14:42:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01487v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01487v4,"cs.LO, 03B45, 03B52, 68Q85, F.4.1"
Rician likelihood loss for quantitative MRI using self-supervised deep   learning,"Christopher S. Parker, Anna Schroder, Sean C. Epstein, James Cole, Daniel C. Alexander, Hui Zhang","Purpose: Previous quantitative MR imaging studies using self-supervised deep learning have reported biased parameter estimates at low SNR. Such systematic errors arise from the choice of Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function for network training, which is incompatible with Rician-distributed MR magnitude signals. To address this issue, we introduce the negative log Rician likelihood (NLR) loss. Methods: A numerically stable and accurate implementation of the NLR loss was developed to estimate quantitative parameters of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) model and intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model. Parameter estimation accuracy, precision and overall error were evaluated in terms of bias, variance and root mean squared error and compared against the MSE loss over a range of SNRs (5 - 30). Results: Networks trained with NLR loss show higher estimation accuracy than MSE for the ADC and IVIM diffusion coefficients as SNR decreases, with minimal loss of precision or total error. At high effective SNR (high SNR and small diffusion coefficients), both losses show comparable accuracy and precision for all parameters of both models. Conclusion: The proposed NLR loss is numerically stable and accurate across the full range of tested SNRs and improves parameter estimation accuracy of diffusion coefficients using self-supervised deep learning. We expect the development to benefit quantitative MR imaging techniques broadly, enabling more accurate parameter estimation from noisy data.",2023-07-13T21:42:26Z,2023-07-13T21:42:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07072v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07072v1,"cs.LG, cs.CE, eess.IV, q-bio.QM, stat.ML"
Quantitative Technology Forecasting: a Review of Trend Extrapolation   Methods,"Peng-Hung Tsai, Daniel Berleant, Richard S. Segall, Hyacinthe Aboudja, Venkata Jaipal R. Batthula, Sheela Duggirala, Michael Howell","Quantitative technology forecasting uses quantitative methods to understand and project technological changes. It is a broad field encompassing many different techniques and has been applied to a vast range of technologies. A widely used approach in this field is trend extrapolation. Based on the publications available to us, there has been little or no attempt made to systematically review the empirical evidence on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques. This study attempts to close this gap by conducting a systematic review of technology forecasting literature addressing the application of quantitative trend extrapolation techniques. We identified 25 studies relevant to the objective of this research and classified the techniques used in the studies into different categories, among which growth curves and time series methods were shown to remain popular over the past decade, while newer methods, such as machine learning-based hybrid models, have emerged in recent years. As more effort and evidence are needed to determine if hybrid models are superior to traditional methods, we expect to see a growing trend in the development and application of hybrid models to technology forecasting.",2024-01-04T21:41:08Z,2024-01-04T21:41:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02549v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02549v1,"cs.AI, stat.AP"
Multiplane Quantitative Phase Imaging Using a Wavelength-Multiplexed   Diffractive Optical Processor,"Che-Yung Shen, Jingxi Li, Tianyi Gan, Yuhang Li, Langxing Bai, Mona Jarrahi, Aydogan Ozcan","Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a label-free technique that provides optical path length information for transparent specimens, finding utility in biology, materials science, and engineering. Here, we present quantitative phase imaging of a 3D stack of phase-only objects using a wavelength-multiplexed diffractive optical processor. Utilizing multiple spatially engineered diffractive layers trained through deep learning, this diffractive processor can transform the phase distributions of multiple 2D objects at various axial positions into intensity patterns, each encoded at a unique wavelength channel. These wavelength-multiplexed patterns are projected onto a single field-of-view (FOV) at the output plane of the diffractive processor, enabling the capture of quantitative phase distributions of input objects located at different axial planes using an intensity-only image sensor. Based on numerical simulations, we show that our diffractive processor could simultaneously achieve all-optical quantitative phase imaging across several distinct axial planes at the input by scanning the illumination wavelength. A proof-of-concept experiment with a 3D-fabricated diffractive processor further validated our approach, showcasing successful imaging of two distinct phase objects at different axial positions by scanning the illumination wavelength in the terahertz spectrum.

MRI Parameter Mapping via Gaussian Mixture VAE: Breaking the Assumption   of Independent Pixels,"Moucheng Xu, Yukun Zhou, Tobias Goodwin-Allcock, Kimia Firoozabadi, Joseph Jacob, Daniel C. Alexander, Paddy J. Slator","We introduce and demonstrate a new paradigm for quantitative parameter mapping in MRI. Parameter mapping techniques, such as diffusion MRI and quantitative MRI, have the potential to robustly and repeatably measure biologically-relevant tissue maps that strongly relate to underlying microstructure. Quantitative maps are calculated by fitting a model to multiple images, e.g. with least-squares or machine learning. However, the overwhelming majority of model fitting techniques assume that each voxel is independent, ignoring any co-dependencies in the data. This makes model fitting sensitive to voxelwise measurement noise, hampering reliability and repeatability. We propose a self-supervised deep variational approach that breaks the assumption of independent pixels, leveraging redundancies in the data to effectively perform data-driven regularisation of quantitative maps. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms current model fitting techniques in dMRI simulations and real data. Especially with a Gaussian mixture prior, our model enables sharper quantitative maps, revealing finer anatomical details that are not presented in the baselines. Our approach can hence support the clinical adoption of parameter mapping methods such as dMRI and qMRI.",2024-11-16T11:11:36Z,2024-11-16T11:11:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10772v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10772v1,"eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ML"
Vessel segmentation for X-separation,"Taechang Kim, Sooyeon Ji, Kyeongseon Min, Minjun Kim, Jonghyo Youn, Chungseok Oh, Jiye Kim, Jongho Lee","$\chi$-separation is an advanced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) method that is designed to generate paramagnetic ($\chi_{para}$) and diamagnetic ($|\chi_{dia}|$) susceptibility maps, reflecting the distribution of iron and myelin in the brain. However, vessels have shown artifacts, interfering with the accurate quantification of iron and myelin in applications. To address this challenge, a new vessel segmentation method for $\chi$-separation is developed. The method comprises three steps: 1) Seed generation from $\textit{R}_2^*$ and the product of $\chi_{para}$ and $|\chi_{dia}|$ maps; 2) Region growing, guided by vessel geometry, creating a vessel mask; 3) Refinement of the vessel mask by excluding non-vessel structures. The performance of the method was compared to conventional vessel segmentation methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. To demonstrate the utility of the method, it was tested in two applications: quantitative evaluation of a neural network-based $\chi$-separation reconstruction method ($\chi$-sepnet-$\textit{R}_2^*$) and population-averaged region of interest (ROI) analysis. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to the conventional vessel segmentation methods, effectively excluding the non-vessel structures, achieving the highest Dice score coefficient. For the applications, applying vessel masks report notable improvements for the quantitative evaluation of $\chi$-sepnet-$\textit{R}_2^*$ and statistically significant differences in population-averaged ROI analysis. These applications suggest excluding vessels when analyzing the $\chi$-separation maps provide more accurate evaluations. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate various applications, offering reliable analysis through the generation of a high-quality vessel mask.",2025-02-03T03:37:46Z,2025-02-03T03:37:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01023v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01023v1,"cs.CV, q-bio.QM"
Expressiveness and Closure Properties for Quantitative Languages,"Krishnendu Chatterjee, Laurent Doyen, Thomas A Henzinger","Weighted automata are nondeterministic automata with numerical weights on transitions. They can define quantitative languages~$L$ that assign to each word~$w$ a real number~$L(w)$. In the case of infinite words, the value of a run is naturally computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit-average, or discounted-sum of the transition weights. The value of a word $w$ is the supremum of the values of the runs over $w$. We study expressiveness and closure questions about these quantitative languages. We first show that the set of words with value greater than a threshold can be non-$\omega$-regular for deterministic limit-average and discounted-sum automata, while this set is always $\omega$-regular when the threshold is isolated (i.e., some neighborhood around the threshold contains no word). In the latter case, we prove that the $\omega$-regular language is robust against small perturbations of the transition weights.

Sharp quantitative Faber-Krahn inequalities and the   Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula,"Mark Allen, Dennis Kriventsov, Robin Neumayer","The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, we establish new sharp quantitative estimates for Faber-Krahn inequalities on simply connected space forms. We prove that the gap between the first eigenvalue of a given set $\Omega$ and that of the ball quantitatively controls both the $L^1$ distance of this set from a ball {\it and} the $L^2$ distance between the corresponding eigenfunctions: \[ \lambda_1(\Omega) - \lambda_1(B) \gtrsim |\Omega \Delta B|^2 + \int |u_{\Omega} - u_B|^2, \] where $B$ denotes the nearest geodesic ball to $\Omega$ with $|B|=|\Omega|$ and $u_\Omega$ denotes the first eigenfunction with suitable normalization. On Euclidean space, this extends a result of Brasco-De Phillipis-Velichkov; the eigenfunction control largely builds upon new regularity results for minimizers of critically perturbed Alt-Cafarelli type functionals in our companion paper. On the round sphere and hyperbolic space, the present results are the first sharp quantitative results with respect to any distance; here the local portion of the analysis is based on new implicit spectral analysis techniques.   Second, we apply these sharp quantitative Faber-Krahn inequalities in order to establish a quantitative form of the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman (ACF) monotonicity formula. We show that the energy drop in the ACF monotonicity formula from one scale to the next controls how close a pair of admissible functions is from a pair of complementary half-plane solutions. In particular, when the square root of the energy drop summed over all scales is small, our result implies the existence of tangents (unique blowups) of these functions.",2021-07-07T22:27:02Z,2023-03-30T22:30:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03505v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03505v3,"math.AP, 47A75, 49Q20, 42B37"
"Facilitating the Integration of Ethical Reasoning into Quantitative   Courses: Stakeholder Analysis, Ethical Practice Standards, and Case Studies","Rochelle E. Tractenberg, Suzanne Thorton","Case studies are typically used to teach 'ethics', but in quantitative courses it can seem distracting, for both instructor and learner, to introduce a case analysis. Moreover, case analyses are typically focused on issues relating to people: obtaining consent, dealing with research team members, and/or potential institutional policy violations. While relevant to some research, not all students in quantitative courses plan to become researchers, and ethical practice is an essential topic for students of of mathematics, statistics, data science, and computing regardless of whether or not the learner intends to do research. Ethical reasoning is a way of thinking that requires the individual to assess what they know about a potential ethical problem (their prerequisite knowledge), and in some cases, how behaviors they observe, are directed to perform, or have performed, diverge from what they know to be ethical behavior. Ethical reasoning is a learnable, improvable set of knowledge, skills, and abilities that enable learners to recognize what they do and do not know about what constitutes 'ethical practice' of a discipline, and in some cases, to contemplate alternative decisions about how to first recognize, and then proceed past, or respond to, such divergences. A stakeholder analysis is part of prerequisite knowledge, and can be used whether there is or is not an actual case or situation to react to. In courses with mainly quantitative content, a stakeholder analysis is a useful tool for instruction and assessment. It can be used to both integrate authentic ethical content and encourage careful quantitative thought. It is a mistake to treat 'training in ethical practice' and 'training in responsible conduct of research' as the same thing. This paper discusses how to introduce ethical reasoning, stakeholder analysis, and ethical practice standards authentically in quantitative courses.",2024-01-03T20:44:55Z,2024-12-10T20:07:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01973v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01973v2,"stat.OT, math.HO, 97, 00A99, 97A99, 97A40, A.m; J.m; K.4; K.7"

On size and growth of cells,Arezki Boudaoud,"Understanding how growth induces form is a longstanding biological question. Many studies concentrated on the shapes of plant cells, fungi or bacteria. Some others have shown the importance of the mechanical properties of bacterial walls and plant tissues in pattern formation. Here I sketch a simple physical picture of cell growth. The study is focussed on isolated cells that have walls. They are modeled as thin elastic shells containing a liquid, which pressure drives the growth as generally admitted for bacteria or plant cells. Requiring mechanical equilibrium leads to estimations of typical cell sizes, in quantitative agreement with compiled data including bacteria, cochlear outer hair, fungi, yeast, root hair and giant alga cells.",2002-06-13T16:54:33Z,2002-06-13T16:54:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0206040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0206040v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio"

Moreover, a similar dichotomy law holds for the general Hausdorff measure, which completes the metric theory of this set.",2018-01-31T08:04:21Z,2018-01-31T08:04:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10334v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10334v1,"math.DS, math.NT, 28A80, 28D05, 11K55"

Under the assumptions that $W_j \in L^{q_j}$ for some $q_1 \in [2, \infty]$, $q_2 \in (2, \infty]$, and $W_2$ exhibits rapid decay at infinity, we prove new global unique continuation estimates. This improvement is accomplished by reducing our equations to vector-valued Beltrami systems.

This allows us to derive the optimal convergence rate without having to show the closeness of the Lagrange-multipliers.",2023-09-21T18:17:45Z,2023-09-21T18:17:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12409v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12409v1,"math.AP, 53E10, 35K57"
Fejér monotone sequences revisited,"Ulrich Kohlenbach, Pedro Pinto","In this paper we introduce a localized and relativized generalization of the usual concept of Fej\'er monotonicity together with uniform and quantitative versions thereof and show that the main quantitative results obtained by the 1st author together with Nicolae and Leu\c{s}tean in 2018 and with L\'opez-Acedo and Nicolae in 2019 respectively, extend to this generalization. Our framework, in particular, covers the sequence generated by the Dykstra algorithm while the latter is not Fej\'er-monotone in the ordinary sense. This gives a theoretical explanation why under a metric regularity assumption one obtains an explicit rate of convergence for Dykstra's algorithm which was proved recently by the 2nd author.",2023-10-10T11:21:11Z,2023-10-10T11:21:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06528v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06528v1,"math.OC, math.CA, 47J25 (Primary) 41A65, 03F10 (Secondary)"

Multiscale interpolative construction of quantized tensor trains,Michael Lindsey,"Quantized tensor trains (QTTs) have recently emerged as a framework for the numerical discretization of continuous functions, with the potential for widespread applications in numerical analysis. However, the theory of QTT approximation is not fully understood. In this work, we advance this theory from the point of view of multiscale polynomial interpolation. This perspective clarifies why QTT ranks decay with increasing depth, quantitatively controls QTT rank in terms of smoothness of the target function, and explains why certain functions with sharp features and poor quantitative smoothness can still be well approximated by QTTs. The perspective also motivates new practical and efficient algorithms for the construction of QTTs from function evaluations on multiresolution grids.",2023-11-21T12:07:09Z,2024-04-22T17:30:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12554v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12554v3,"math.NA, cs.NA"

We present sufficient conditions on equation coefficients that ensure the integrability and uniform integrability of the functionals of random trees used in this representation, and yield quantitative estimates of its explosion time. Those conditions rely on the analysis of a marked branching process that controls the growth of random trees, in which marks can be interpreted as mutant types in population genetics models. We also show how branching process explosion is connected to existence and uniqueness of ODE solutions.",2025-02-15T02:46:26Z,2025-02-19T01:56:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10644v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10644v2,"math.PR, math.CA, 65L06, 34A25, 34-04, 05C05, 65C05"

On the blowup of quantitative unique continuation estimates for waves   and applications to stability estimates,"Spyridon Filippas, Lauri Oksanen",In this paper we are interested in the blowup of a geometric constant $\mathfrak{C}(\delta)$ appearing in the optimal quantitative unique continuation property for wave operators. In a particular geometric context we prove an upper bound for $\mathfrak{C}(\delta)$ as $\delta$ goes to $0$. Here $\delta>0$ denotes the distance to the maximal unique continuation domain. As applications we obtain stability estimates for the unique continuation property up to the maximal domain. Using our abstract framework~\cite{FO25abstract} we also derive a stability estimate for a hyperbolic inverse problem. The proof is based on a global explicit Carleman estimate combined with the propagation techniques of Laurent-L\'eautaud.,2025-02-18T16:51:32Z,2025-02-18T16:51:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13040v1,"math.AP, 35B60, 35L05, 35Q93, 35R30"

"Efficiency, Robustness and Stochasticity of Gene Regulatory Networks in   Systems Biology: lambda Switch as a Working Example","X. Zhu, L. Yin, L. Hood, D. Galas, P. Ao","Phage lambda is one of the most studied biological models in modern molecular biology. Over the past 50 years quantitative experimental knowledge on this biological model has been accumulated at all levels: physics, chemistry, genomics, proteomics, functions, and more. All its components have been known to a great detail. The theoretical task has been to integrate its components to make the organism working quantitatively in a harmonic manner. This would test our biological understanding and would lay a solid fundamental for further explorations and applications, an obvious goal of systems biology. One of the outstanding challenges in doing so has been the so-called stability puzzle of lambda switch: the biologically observed robustness and its difficult mathematical reconstruction based on known experimental values. In this chapter we review the recent theoretical and experimental efforts on tackling this problem. An emphasis is put on the minimum quantitative modeling where a successful numerical agreement between experiments and modeling has been achieved. A novel method tentatively named stochastic dynamical structure analysis emerged from such study is also discussed within a broad modeling perspective.",2005-12-02T17:14:59Z,2006-02-09T03:23:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0512007v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0512007v2,"q-bio.SC, cond-mat.other, nlin.AO, q-bio.MN, q-bio.OT"

A tight quantitative version of Arrow's impossibility theorem,Nathan Keller,"The well-known Impossibility Theorem of Arrow asserts that any Generalized Social Welfare Function (GSWF) with at least three alternatives, which satisfies Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity and is not a dictatorship, is necessarily non-transitive. In 2002, Kalai asked whether one can obtain the following quantitative version of the theorem: For any $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta=\delta(\epsilon)$ such that if a GSWF on three alternatives satisfies the IIA condition and its probability of non-transitive outcome is at most $\delta$, then the GSWF is at most $\epsilon$-far from being a dictatorship or from breaching the Unanimity condition. In 2009, Mossel proved such quantitative version, with $\delta(\epsilon)=\exp(-C/\epsilon^{21})$, and generalized it to GSWFs with $k$ alternatives, for all $k \geq 3$. In this paper we show that the quantitative version holds with $\delta(\epsilon)=C \cdot \epsilon^3$, and that this result is tight up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, our result (like Mossel's) generalizes to GSWFs with $k$ alternatives. Our proof is based on the works of Kalai and Mossel, but uses also an additional ingredient: a combination of the Bonami-Beckner hypercontractive inequality with a reverse hypercontractive inequality due to Borell, applied to find simultaneously upper bounds and lower bounds on the ""noise correlation"" between Boolean functions on the discrete cube.",2010-03-20T23:25:24Z,2010-03-20T23:25:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3956v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3956v1,"math.CO, cs.GT, math.PR, 05D40; 60C05; 91B14; 39A12"

A Quantitative Test of Population Genetics Using Spatio-Genetic Patterns   in Bacterial Colonies,"Kirill S. Korolev, Joao B. Xavier, David R. Nelson, Kevin R. Foster","It is widely accepted that population genetics theory is the cornerstone of evolutionary analyses. Empirical tests of the theory, however, are challenging because of the complex relationships between space, dispersal, and evolution. Critically, we lack quantitative validation of the spatial models of population genetics. Here we combine analytics, on and off-lattice simulations, and experiments with bacteria to perform quantitative tests of the theory. We study two bacterial species, the gut microbe Escherichia coli and the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and show that spatio-genetic patterns in colony biofilms of both species are accurately described by an extension of the one-dimensional stepping-stone model. We use one empirical measure, genetic diversity at the colony periphery, to parameterize our models and show that we can then accurately predict another key variable: the degree of short-range cell migration along an edge. Moreover, the model allows us to estimate other key parameters including effective population size (density) at the expansion frontier. While our experimental system is a simplification of natural microbial community, we argue it is a proof of principle that the spatial models of population genetics can quantitatively capture organismal evolution.",2011-10-24T23:28:41Z,2011-10-24T23:28:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5376v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.5376v1,"q-bio.PE, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph"
A quantitative Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem without neutrality,"Elchanan Mossel, Miklos Z. Racz","Recently, quantitative versions of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem were proven for $k=3$ alternatives by Friedgut, Kalai, Keller and Nisan and for neutral functions on $k \geq 4$ alternatives by Isaksson, Kindler and Mossel.   We prove a quantitative version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for general social choice functions for any number $k \geq 3$ of alternatives. In particular we show that for a social choice function $f$ on $k \geq 3$ alternatives and $n$ voters, which is $\epsilon$-far from the family of nonmanipulable functions, a uniformly chosen voter profile is manipulable with probability at least inverse polynomial in $n$, $k$, and $\epsilon^{-1}$.   Removing the neutrality assumption of previous theorems is important for multiple reasons. For one, it is known that there is a conflict between anonymity and neutrality, and since most common voting rules are anonymous, they cannot always be neutral. Second, virtual elections are used in many applications in artificial intelligence, where there are often restrictions on the outcome of the election, and so neutrality is not a natural assumption in these situations.   Ours is a unified proof which in particular covers all previous cases established before. The proof crucially uses reverse hypercontractivity in addition to several ideas from the two previous proofs. Much of the work is devoted to understanding functions of a single voter, and in particular we also prove a quantitative Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for one voter.",2011-10-26T19:29:12Z,2012-03-29T10:13:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5888v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.5888v2,"math.CO, cs.GT, math.PR, 05D40, 91B14, 68Q87"

Westphal, Gerardo Dominguez, Mark Thiemens, Michael M. Fogler, D. N. Basov","Near-field infrared spectroscopy by elastic scattering of light from a probe tip resolves optical contrasts in materials at dramatically sub-wavelength scales across a broad energy range, with the demonstrated capacity for chemical identification at the nanoscale. However, current models of probe-sample near-field interactions still cannot provide a sufficiently quantitatively interpretation of measured near-field contrasts, especially in the case of materials supporting strong surface phonons. We present a model of near-field spectroscopy derived from basic principles and verified by finite-element simulations, demonstrating superb predictive agreement both with tunable quantum cascade laser near-field spectroscopy of SiO$_2$ thin films and with newly presented nanoscale Fourier transform infrared (nanoFTIR) spectroscopy of crystalline SiC. We discuss the role of probe geometry, field retardation, and surface mode dispersion in shaping the measured near-field response. This treatment enables a route to quantitatively determine nano-resolved optical constants, as we demonstrate by inverting newly presented nanoFTIR spectra of an SiO$_2$ thin film into the frequency dependent dielectric function of its mid-infrared optical phonon.

A quantitative approach to evolution of music and philosophy,"Vilson Vieira, Renato Fabbri, Gonzalo Travieso, Osvaldo N. Oliveira Jr., Luciano da Fontoura Costa","The development of new statistical and computational methods is increasingly making it possible to bridge the gap between hard sciences and humanities. In this study, we propose an approach based on a quantitative evaluation of attributes of objects in fields of humanities, from which concepts such as dialectics and opposition are formally defined mathematically. As case studies, we analyzed the temporal evolution of classical music and philosophy by obtaining data for 8 features characterizing the corresponding fields for 7 well-known composers and philosophers, which were treated with multivariate statistics and pattern recognition methods. A bootstrap method was applied to avoid statistical bias caused by the small sample data set, with which hundreds of artificial composers and philosophers were generated, influenced by the 7 names originally chosen. Upon defining indices for opposition, skewness and counter-dialectics, we confirmed the intuitive analysis of historians in that classical music evolved according to a master-apprentice tradition, while in philosophy changes were driven by opposition. Though these case studies were meant only to show the possibility of treating phenomena in humanities quantitatively, including a quantitative measure of concepts such as dialectics and opposition the results are encouraging for further application of the approach presented here to many other areas, since it is entirely generic.",2013-11-14T01:18:31Z,2013-11-14T01:18:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4513v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4513v1,"stat.AP, cs.SD, 62A01"

Quantitative $μ$PIV Measurements of Velocity Profiles,"P. W. Bryant, R. F. Neumann, M. J. B. Moura, M. Steiner, M. S. Carvalho, C. Feger","In Microscopic Particle Image Velocimetry ($\mu$PIV), velocity fields in microchannels are sampled over finite volumes within which the velocity fields themselves may vary significantly. In the past, this has limited measurements often to be only qualitative in nature, blind to velocity magnitudes. In the pursuit of quantitatively useful results, one has treated the effects of the finite volume as errors that must be corrected by means of ever more complicated processing techniques. Resulting measurements have limited robustness and require convoluted efforts to understand measurement uncertainties. To increase the simplicity and utility of $\mu$PIV measurements, we introduce a straightforward method, based directly on measurement, by which one can determine the size and shape of the volume over which moving fluids are sampled. By comparing measurements with simulation, we verify that this method enables quantitative measurement of velocity profiles across entire channels, as well as an understanding of experimental uncertainties. We show how the method permits measurement of an unknown flow rate through a channel of known geometry. We demonstrate the method to be robust against common sources of experimental uncertainty. We also apply the theory to model the technique of Scanning $\mu$PIV, which is often used to locate the center of a channel, and we show how and why it can in fact misidentify the center.

Model-checking Quantitative Alternating-time Temporal Logic on   One-counter Game Models,Steen Vester,"We consider quantitative extensions of the alternating-time temporal logics ATL/ATLs called quantitative alternating-time temporal logics (QATL/QATLs) in which the value of a counter can be compared to constants using equality, inequality and modulo constraints. We interpret these logics in one-counter game models which are infinite duration games played on finite control graphs where each transition can increase or decrease the value of an unbounded counter. That is, the state-space of these games are, generally, infinite. We consider the model-checking problem of the logics QATL and QATLs on one-counter game models with VASS semantics for which we develop algorithms and provide matching lower bounds. Our algorithms are based on reductions of the model-checking problems to model-checking games. This approach makes it quite simple for us to deal with extensions of the logical languages as well as the infinite state spaces. The framework generalizes on one hand qualitative problems such as ATL/ATLs model-checking of finite-state systems, model-checking of the branching-time temporal logics CTL and CTLs on one-counter processes and the realizability problem of LTL specifications. On the other hand the model-checking problem for QATL/QATLs generalizes quantitative problems such as the fixed-initial credit problem for energy games (in the case of QATL) and energy parity games (in the case of QATLs). Our results are positive as we show that the generalizations are not too costly with respect to complexity. As a byproduct we obtain new results on the complexity of model-checking CTLs in one-counter processes and show that deciding the winner in one-counter games with LTL objectives is 2ExpSpace-complete.",2014-09-19T14:41:57Z,2014-09-19T14:41:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5681v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5681v1,"cs.LO, F.3.1"
Evidence for a creative dilemma posed by repeated collaborations,Hiroyasu Inoue,"We focused on how repeat collaborations in projects for inventions affect performance. Repeat collaborations have two contradictory aspects. A positive aspect is team development or experience, and a negative aspect is team degeneration or decline. Since both contradicting phenomena are observed, inventors have a dilemma as to whether they should keep collaborating in a team or not. The dilemma has not previously been quantitatively analyzed.   We provide quantitative and extensive analyses of the dilemma in creative projects by using patent data from Japan and the United States. We confirm three predictions to quantitatively validate the existence of the dilemma. The first prediction is that the greater the patent a team achieves, the longer the team will work together. The second prediction is that the impact of consecutive patents decreases after a team makes a remarkable invention, which is measured by the impact of patents. The third prediction is that the expectation of impact with new teams is greater than that with the same teams successful in the past. We find these predictions are validated in patents published in Japan and the United States. On the basis of these three predictions, we can quantitatively validate the dilemma in creative projects. We also propose preventive strategies for degeneration. One is developing technological diversity, and another is developing inventor diversity in teams.We find the two strategies are both effective by validating with the data.",2014-09-22T20:35:15Z,2015-08-18T14:18:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6336v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6336v4,"cs.SI, physics.soc-ph"
Learning quantitative sequence-function relationships from massively   parallel experiments,"Gurinder S. Atwal, Justin B. Kinney","A fundamental aspect of biological information processing is the ubiquity of sequence-function relationships -- functions that map the sequence of DNA, RNA, or protein to a biochemically relevant activity. Most sequence-function relationships in biology are quantitative, but only recently have experimental techniques for effectively measuring these relationships been developed. The advent of such ""massively parallel"" experiments presents an exciting opportunity for the concepts and methods of statistical physics to inform the study of biological systems. After reviewing these recent experimental advances, we focus on the problem of how to infer parametric models of sequence-function relationships from the data produced by these experiments. Specifically, we retrace and extend recent theoretical work showing that inference based on mutual information, not the standard likelihood-based approach, is often necessary for accurately learning the parameters of these models. Closely connected with this result is the emergence of ""diffeomorphic modes"" -- directions in parameter space that are far less constrained by data than likelihood-based inference would suggest. Analogous to Goldstone modes in physics, diffeomorphic modes arise from an arbitrarily broken symmetry of the inference problem. An analytically tractable model of a massively parallel experiment is then described, providing an explicit demonstration of these fundamental aspects of statistical inference. This paper concludes with an outlook on the theoretical and computational challenges currently facing studies of quantitative sequence-function relationships.",2015-05-30T01:20:59Z,2015-09-22T15:47:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00054v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00054v2,"q-bio.QM, math.ST, physics.bio-ph, physics.data-an, stat.ML, stat.TH"

Low Rank Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting,"Gal Mazor, Lior Weizman, Assaf Tal, Yonina C. Eldar","Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a relatively new approach that provides quantitative MRI measures using randomized acquisition. Extraction of physical quantitative tissue parameters is performed off-line, without the need of patient presence, based on acquisition with varying parameters and a dictionary generated according to the Bloch equation simulations. MRF uses hundreds of radio frequency (RF) excitation pulses for acquisition, and therefore a high undersampling ratio in the sampling domain (k-space) is required for reasonable scanning time. This undersampling causes spatial artifacts that hamper the ability to accurately estimate the tissue's quantitative values. In this work, we introduce a new approach for quantitative MRI using MRF, called magnetic resonance Fingerprinting with LOw Rank (FLOR).   Methods: We exploit the low rank property of the concatenated temporal imaging contrasts, on top of the fact that the MRF signal is sparsely represented in the generated dictionary domain. We present an iterative scheme that consists of a gradient step followed by a low rank projection using the singular value decomposition.   Results: Experimental results consist of retrospective sampling, that allows comparison to a well defined reference, and prospective sampling that shows the performance of FLOR for a real-data sampling scenario. Both experiments demonstrate improved parameter accuracy compared to other compressed-sensing and low-rank based methods for MRF at 5% and 9% sampling ratios, for the retrospective and prospective experiments, respectively.   Conclusions: We have shown through retrospective and prospective experiments that by exploiting the low rank nature of the MRF signal, FLOR recovers the MRF temporal undersampled images and provides more accurate parameter maps compared to previous iterative methods.",2017-01-26T12:11:40Z,2017-06-27T14:44:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07668v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07668v2,"physics.med-ph, cs.IT, math.IT"

Quantitative approach to multifractality induced by correlations and   broad distribution of data,"Rafal Rak, Dariusz Grech","We analyze quantitatively the effect of spurious multifractality induced by the presence of fat-tailed symmetric and asymmetric probability distributions of fluctuations in time series. In the presented approach different kinds of symmetric and asymmetric broad probability distributions of synthetic data are examined starting from Levy regime up to those with finite variance. We use nonextensive Tsallis statistics to construct all considered data in order to have good analytical description of frequencies of fluctuations in the whole range of their magnitude and simultaneously the full control over exponent of power-law decay for tails of probability distribution. The semi-analytical compact formulas are then provided to express the level of spurious multifractality generated by the presence of fat tails in terms of Tsallis parameter $\tilde{q}$ and the scaling exponent $\beta$ of the asymptotic decay of cumulated probability density function (CDF).The results are presented in Hurst and H\""{o}lder languages - more often used in study of multifractal phenomena. According to the provided semi-analytical relations, it is argued how one can make a clear quantitative distinction for any real data between true multifractality caused by the presence of nonlinear correlations, spurious multifractality generated by fat-tailed shape of distributions - eventually with their asymmetry, and the correction due to linear autocorrelations in analyzed time series of finite length. In particular, the spurious multifractal effect of fat tails is found basic for proper quantitative estimation of all spurious multifractal effects.

Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging: From Fingerprinting to   Integrated Physics-Based Models,"Guozhi Dong, Michael Hintermüller, Kostas Papafitsoros","Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is concerned with estimating (in physical units) values of magnetic and tissue parameters e.g., relaxation times $T_1$, $T_2$, or proton density $\rho$. Recently in [Ma et al., Nature, 2013], Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) was introduced as a technique being capable of simultaneously recovering such quantitative parameters by using a two step procedure: (i) given a probe, a series of magnetization maps are computed and then (ii) matched to (quantitative) parameters with the help of a pre-computed dictionary which is related to the Bloch manifold. In this paper, we first put MRF and its variants into a perspective with optimization and inverse problems to gain mathematical insights concerning identifiability of parameters under noise and interpretation in terms of optimizers. Motivated by the fact that the Bloch manifold is non-convex and that the accuracy of the MRF-type algorithms is limited by the ""discretization size"" of the dictionary, a novel physics-based method for qMRI is proposed. In contrast to the conventional two step method, our model is dictionary-free and is rather governed by a single non-linear equation, which is studied analytically. This non-linear equation is efficiently solved via robustified Newton-type methods. The effectiveness of the new method for noisy and undersampled data is shown both analytically and via extensive numerical examples for which also improvement over MRF and its variants is documented.",2019-03-28T14:00:59Z,2019-03-28T14:00:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11979v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.11979v1,"math.OC, 49K40, 49M15, 65J15, 65J20, 65J22"
Time-Resolved Open-Circuit Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy for   Quantitative Analysis of Nanowire Piezoelectricity and Triboelectricity,"Yonatan Calahorra, Wonjong Kim, Jelena Vukajlovic Plestina, Anna Fontcuberta i Morral, Sohini Kar-Narayan","Piezoelectric nanowires are promising materials for sensing, actuation and energy harvesting, due to their enhanced properties at the nanoscale. However, quantitative characterization of piezoelectricity in nanomaterials is challenging due to practical limitations and the onset of additional electromechanical phenomena, such as the triboelectric and piezotronic effects. Here, we present an open-circuit conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) methodology for quantitative extraction of the axial piezoelectric coefficients of nanowires. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the standard short-circuit cAFM mode is inadequate for piezoelectric characterization of nanowires, and that such measurements are governed by competing mechanisms. We introduce an alternative open-circuit configuration, and employ time-resolved electromechanical measurements, to extract the piezoelectric coefficients. This method was applied to GaAs, an important semiconductor, with relatively low piezoelectric coefficients. The results obtained for GaAs,~0.4-1 pm/V, are in good agreement with existing knowledge and theory. Our method represents a significant advance in understanding the coexistence of different electromechanical effects, and in quantitative piezoelectric nanoscale characterization.

Software Safety Demonstration and Idemnification,Odell Hegna,"Computers may control safety-critical operations in machines having embedded software. This memoir proposes a regimen to verify such algorithms at prescribed levels of statistical confidence. The United States Department of Defense standard for system safety engineering (MIL-STD-882E) defines development procedures for safety-critical systems. However, a problem exists: the Standard fails to distinguish quantitative product assurance technique from categorical process assurance method for software development. Resulting is conflict in the technical definition of the term risk. The primary goal here is to show that a quantitative risk-based product assurance method exists and is consistent with hardware practice. Discussion appears in two major parts: theory, which shows the relationship between automata and software; and application, which covers demonstration and indemnification. Demonstration is a technique for generating random tests; indemnification converts pass/fail test results to compound Poisson parameters (severity and intensity). Together, demonstration and indemnification yield statistical confidence that safety-critical code meets design intent. Statistical confidence is the keystone of quantitative product assurance. A secondary goal is resolving the conflict over the term risk. The first meaning is an accident model known in mathematics as the compound Poisson stochastic process, and so is called statistical risk. Various of its versions underlie the theories of safety and reliability. The second is called developmental risk. It considers software autonomy, which considers time until manual recovery of control. Once these meanings are separated, MIL-STD-882 can properly support either formal quantitative safety assurance or empirical process robustness, which differ in impact.",2015-01-05T11:10:15Z,2019-03-11T01:52:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00820v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00820v4,"cs.LO, D.2.4; F.1.1; D.2.8"
Inferring simple but precise quantitative models of human oocyte and   early embryo development,"Brian D Leahy, Catherine Racowsky, Daniel Needleman","Macroscopic, phenomenological models have proven useful as concise framings of our understandings in fields from statistical physics to economics to biology. Constructing a phenomenological model for development would provide a framework for understanding the complicated, regulatory nature of oogenesis and embryogenesis. Here, we use a data-driven approach to infer quantitative, precise models of human oocyte maturation and pre-implantation embryo development, by analyzing existing clinical In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) data on 7,399 IVF cycles resulting in 57,827 embryos. Surprisingly, we find that both oocyte maturation and early embryo development are quantitatively described by simple models with minimal interactions. This simplicity suggests that oogenesis and embryogenesis are composed of modular processes that are relatively siloed from one another. In particular, our analysis provides strong evidence that (i) pre-antral follicles produce anti-M{\""u}llerian hormone independently of effects from other follicles, (ii) oocytes mature to metaphase-II independently of the woman's age, her BMI, and other factors, (iii) early embryo development is memoryless for the variables assessed here, in that the probability of an embryo transitioning from its current developmental stage to the next is independent of its previous stage.

Uniform Ergodicity of the Iterated Conditional SMC and Geometric   Ergodicity of Particle Gibbs samplers,"Christophe Andrieu, Anthony Lee, Matti Vihola","We establish quantitative bounds for rates of convergence and asymptotic variances for iterated conditional sequential Monte Carlo (i-cSMC) Markov chains and associated particle Gibbs samplers. Our main findings are that the essential boundedness of potential functions associated with the i-cSMC algorithm provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniform ergodicity of the i-cSMC Markov chain, as well as quantitative bounds on its (uniformly geometric) rate of convergence. Furthermore, we show that the i-cSMC Markov chain cannot even be geometrically ergodic if this essential boundedness does not hold in many applications of interest. Our sufficiency and quantitative bounds rely on a novel non-asymptotic analysis of the expectation of a standard normalizing constant estimate with respect to a ""doubly conditional"" SMC algorithm. In addition, our results for i-cSMC imply that the rate of convergence can be improved arbitrarily by increasing N, the number of particles in the algorithm, and that in the presence of mixing assumptions, the rate of convergence can be kept constant by increasing N linearly with the time horizon. We translate the sufficiency of the boundedness condition for i-cSMC into sufficient conditions for the particle Gibbs Markov chain to be geometrically ergodic and quantitative bounds on its geometric rate of convergence, which imply convergence of properties of the particle Gibbs Markov chain to those of its corresponding Gibbs sampler. These results complement recently discovered, and related, conditions for the particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) Markov chain.",2013-12-22T22:13:53Z,2015-04-14T11:41:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6432v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6432v2,"math.PR, 65C40 (Primary), 60J05, 65C05 (Secondary)"
"Value, Representation, Information and Communication",Xiangjun Peng,"A new analytic framework is first formalized via the usage of the Monadology (Leibniz 1898), to expand the understanding of Zermelo-Fraenkel-choice set theory (ZFC) and Von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory (NBG). Implicitly, the framework levels value, representation and information separately. Given the fact that there exists a coincidental equivalence between Von Neumann universe and originally-formalized motivation in ZFC, this work hypothesizes the essential of ordered values for one monand, to carry out efficient communication with the rest. This work then focuses on the relationship among values, representation and information (and suggests potential methods for quantitative analysis). First, this framework generalizes the definition of values and representations from ""Indexes approximate Values"" principle by (Peng 2023) via surreal numbers (Knuth 1974). Second, credited to surreal numbers, this work recursively connects representations and information via subsets of sets. Therefore, the definition to metric space(s) is naturally formed by representations, and quantitative methods (e.g., Hausdorff Distance) can be applied for quantitative analysis among (sub)sets. Third, this framework conjectures that: as long as the metric space is (or can be formed as) complete, the existence tests can be performed via Cauchy Sequence (or its generalized methods). This work finally revisits the communication theory, and suggests new perspectives from the new analytic framework. Particularly, this work hypothesizes a (quantitative) relationship between values and representation, and conjectures that: the optimal construction of representations exists, and it can be derived as the core value of one monad via Cauchy Inequality (or its generalized methods).",2024-03-30T16:02:58Z,2024-03-30T16:02:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00404v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00404v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Intelligent Optimization of Mine Environmental Damage Assessment and   Repair Strategies Based on Deep Learning,Qishuo Cheng,"In recent decades, financial quantification has emerged and matured rapidly. For financial institutions such as funds, investment institutions are increasingly dissatisfied with the situation of passively constructing investment portfolios with average market returns, and are paying more and more attention to active quantitative strategy investment portfolios. This requires the introduction of active stock investment fund management models. Currently, in my country's stock fund investment market, there are many active quantitative investment strategies, and the algorithms used vary widely, such as SVM, random forest, RNN recurrent memory network, etc. This article focuses on this trend, using the emerging LSTM-GRU gate-controlled long short-term memory network model in the field of financial stock investment as a basis to build a set of active investment stock strategies, and combining it with SVM, which has been widely used in the field of quantitative stock investment. Comparing models such as RNN, theoretically speaking, compared to SVM that simply relies on kernel functions for high-order mapping and classification of data, neural network algorithms such as RNN and LSTM-GRU have better principles and are more suitable for processing financial stock data. Then, through multiple By comparison, it was finally found that the LSTM- GRU gate-controlled long short-term memory network has a better accuracy. By selecting the LSTM-GRU algorithm to construct a trading strategy based on the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index constituent stocks, the parameters were adjusted and the neural layer connection was adjusted.

Single Exposure Quantitative Phase Imaging with a Conventional   Microscope using Diffusion Models,"Gabriel della Maggiora, Luis Alberto Croquevielle, Harry Horsley, Thomas Heinis, Artur Yakimovich","Phase imaging is gaining importance due to its applications in fields like biomedical imaging and material characterization. In biomedical applications, it can provide quantitative information missing in label-free microscopy modalities. One of the most prominent methods in phase quantification is the Transport-of-Intensity Equation (TIE). TIE often requires multiple acquisitions at different defocus distances, which is not always feasible in a clinical setting. To address this issue, we propose to use chromatic aberrations to induce the required through-focus images with a single exposure, effectively generating a through-focus stack. Since the defocus distance induced by the aberrations is small, conventional TIE solvers are insufficient to address the resulting artifacts. We propose Zero-Mean Diffusion, a modified version of diffusion models designed for quantitative image prediction, and train it with synthetic data to ensure robust phase retrieval. Our contributions offer an alternative TIE approach that leverages chromatic aberrations, achieving accurate single-exposure phase measurement with white light and thus improving the efficiency of phase imaging. Moreover, we present a new class of diffusion models that are well-suited for quantitative data and have a sound theoretical basis. To validate our approach, we employ a widespread brightfield microscope equipped with a commercially available color camera. We apply our model to clinical microscopy of patients' urine, obtaining accurate phase measurements.",2024-06-06T15:44:24Z,2024-12-20T15:49:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04388v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04388v2,"eess.IV, cs.AI, physics.optics"
Beyond Winning Strategies: Admissible and Admissible Winning Strategies   for Quantitative Reachability Games,"Karan Muvvala, Qi Heng Ho, Morteza Lahijanian","Classical reactive synthesis approaches aim to synthesize a reactive system that always satisfies a given specifications. These approaches often reduce to playing a two-player zero-sum game where the goal is to synthesize a winning strategy. However, in many pragmatic domains, such as robotics, a winning strategy does not always exist, yet it is desirable for the system to make an effort to satisfy its requirements instead of ""giving up"". To this end, this paper investigates the notion of admissible strategies, which formalize ""doing-your-best"", in quantitative reachability games. We show that, unlike the qualitative case, quantitative admissible strategies are history-dependent even for finite payoff functions, making synthesis a challenging task. In addition, we prove that admissible strategies always exist but may produce undesirable optimistic behaviors. To mitigate this, we propose admissible winning strategies, which enforce the best possible outcome while being admissible. We show that both strategies always exist but are not memoryless. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of both strategies and propose synthesis algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the strategies on gridworld and robot manipulator domains.",2024-08-23T21:03:59Z,2024-08-23T21:03:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13369v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13369v1,"cs.GT, cs.FL, cs.LO, cs.RO, D.2.4; I.2.4; I.2.9"
Nonlinear memory in cell division dynamics across species,"Shijie Zhang, Chenyi Fei, Jörn Dunkel","Regulation of cell growth and division is essential to achieve cell-size homeostasis. Recent advances in imaging technologies, such as ``mother machines"" for bacteria or yeast, have allowed long-term tracking of cell-size dynamics across many generations, and thus have brought major insights into the mechanisms underlying cell-size control. However, understanding the governing rules of cell growth and division within a quantitative dynamical-systems framework remains a major challenge. Here, we implement and apply a framework that makes it possible to infer stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with Poisson noise directly from experimentally measured time series for cellular growth and divisions. To account for potential nonlinear memory effects, we parameterize the Poisson intensity of stochastic cell division events in terms of both the cell's current size and its ancestral history. By applying the algorithm to experimentally measured cell size trajectories, we are able to quantitatively evaluate the linear one-step memory hypothesis underlying the popular ``sizer"",``adder"", and ``timer"" models of cell homeostasis. For Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria, Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, we find that in many cases the inferred stochastic models have a substantial nonlinear memory component. This suggests a need to reevaluate and generalize the currently prevailing linear-memory paradigm of cell homeostasis. More broadly, the underlying inference framework is directly applicable to identify quantitative models for stochastic jump processes in a wide range of scientific disciplines.",2024-08-26T18:30:18Z,2024-08-26T18:30:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14564v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14564v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph"

Optimising image capture for low-light widefield quantitative   fluorescence microscopy,"Zane Peterkovic, Avinash Upadhya, Christopher Perrella, Admir Bajraktarevic, Ramses Bautista Gonzalez, Megan Lim, Kylie R Dunning, Kishan Dholakia","Low-light optical imaging refers to the use of cameras to capture images with minimal photon flux. This area has broad application to diverse fields, including optical microscopy for biological studies. In such studies, it is important to reduce the intensity of illumination to reduce adverse effects such as photobleaching and phototoxicity that may perturb the biological system under study. The challenge when minimising illumination is to maintain image quality that reflects the underlying biology and can be used for quantitative measurements. An example is the optical redox ratio which is computed from autofluorescence intensity to measure metabolism. In all such cases, it is critical for researchers to optimise selection and application of scientific cameras to their microscopes, but few resources discuss performance in the low-light regime. In this tutorial, we address the challenges in optical fluorescence imaging at low-light levels for quantitative microscopy, with an emphasis on live biological samples. We analyse the performance of specialised low-light scientific cameras such as the EMCCD, qCMOS, and sCMOS, while considering the differences in platform architecture and the contribution of various sources of noise.

Quantitative Fairness -- A Framework For The Design Of Equitable   Cybernetic Societies,"Kevin Riehl, Michail Makridis, Anastasios Kouvelas","Advancements in computer science, artificial intelligence, and control systems of the recent have catalyzed the emergence of cybernetic societies, where algorithms play a significant role in decision-making processes affecting the daily life of humans in almost every aspect. Algorithmic decision-making expands into almost every industry, government processes critical infrastructure, and shapes the life-reality of people and the very fabric of social interactions and communication. Besides the great potentials to improve efficiency and reduce corruption, missspecified cybernetic systems harbor the threat to create societal inequities, systematic discrimination, and dystopic, totalitarian societies. Fairness is a crucial component in the design of cybernetic systems, to promote cooperation between selfish individuals, to achieve better outcomes at the system level, to confront public resistance, to gain trust and acceptance for rules and institutions, to perforate self-reinforcing cycles of poverty through social mobility, to incentivize motivation, contribution and satisfaction of people through inclusion, to increase social-cohesion in groups, and ultimately to improve life quality. Quantitative descriptions of fairness are crucial to reflect equity into algorithms, but only few works in the fairness literature offer such measures; the existing quantitative measures in the literature are either too application-specific, suffer from undesirable characteristics, or are not ideology-agnostic. Therefore, this work proposes a quantitative, transactional, distributive fairness framework, which enables systematic design of socially feasible decision-making systems. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of fairness and transparency when designing algorithms for equitable, cybernetic societies.",2024-11-20T10:33:02Z,2024-11-20T10:33:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13184v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13184v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
The Relational Quotient Completion,"Francesco Dagnino, Fabio Pasquali","Taking a quotient roughly means changing the notion of equality on a given object, set or type. In a quantitative setting, equality naturally generalises to a distance, measuring how much elements are similar instead of just stating their equivalence. Hence, quotients can be understood quantitatively as a change of distance.   In this paper, we show how, combining Lawvere's doctrines and the calculus of relations, one can unify quantitative and usual quotients in a common picture. More in detail, we introduce relational doctrines as a functorial description of (the core of) the calculus of relations. Then, we define quotients and a universal construction adding them to any relational doctrine, generalising the quotient completion of existential elementary doctrine and also recovering many quantitative examples. This construction deals with an intensional notion of quotient and breaks extensional equality of morphisms. Then, we describe another construction forcing extensionality, showing how it abstracts several notions of separation in metric and topological structures. Combining these two constructions, we get the extensional quotient completion, whose essential image is characterized through the notion of projective cover. As an application, we show that, under suitable conditions, relational doctrines of algebras arise as the extensional quotient completion of free algebras. Finally, we compare relational doctrines to other categorical structures where one can model the calculus of relations.",2024-12-15T20:05:47Z,2024-12-15T20:05:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11295v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11295v1,"math.CT, cs.LO, math.LO"

Quantitative Constraint Logic Programming for Weighted Grammar   Applications,Stefan Riezler,"Constraint logic grammars provide a powerful formalism for expressing complex logical descriptions of natural language phenomena in exact terms. Describing some of these phenomena may, however, require some form of graded distinctions which are not provided by such grammars. Recent approaches to weighted constraint logic grammars attempt to address this issue by adding numerical calculation schemata to the deduction scheme of the underlying CLP framework. Currently, these extralogical extensions are not related to the model-theoretic counterpart of the operational semantics of CLP, i.e., they do not come with a formal semantics at all. The aim of this paper is to present a clear formal semantics for weighted constraint logic grammars, which abstracts away from specific interpretations of weights, but nevertheless gives insights into the parsing problem for such weighted grammars. Building on the formalization of constraint logic grammars in the CLP scheme of Hoehfeld and Smolka 1988, this formal semantics will be given by a quantitative version of CLP. Such a quantitative CLP scheme can also be valuable for CLP tasks independent of grammars.",1997-05-06T13:44:00Z,1997-05-06T13:44:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9705006v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cmp-lg/9705006v1,"cmp-lg, cs.CL"

A Quantitative Measure Of Fairness And Discrimination For Resource   Allocation In Shared Computer Systems,"R. Jain, D. Chiu, W. Hawe","Fairness is an important performance criterion in all resource allocation schemes, including those in distributed computer systems. However, it is often specified only qualitatively. The quantitative measures proposed in the literature are either too specific to a particular application, or suffer from some undesirable characteristics. In this paper, we have introduced a quantitative measure called Indiex of FRairness. The index is applicable to any resource sharing or allocation problem. It is independent of the amount of the resource. The fairness index always lies between 0 and 1. This boundedness aids intuitive understanding of the fairness index. For example, a distribution algorithm with a fairness of 0.10 means that it is unfair to 90% of the users. Also, the discrimination index can be defined as 1 - fairness index.",1998-09-24T05:27:34Z,1998-09-24T05:27:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9809099v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809099v1,"cs.NI, C.2.1"
On the complexity of inducing categorical and quantitative association   rules,"Fabrizio Angiulli, Giovambattista Ianni, Luigi Palopoli","Inducing association rules is one of the central tasks in data mining applications. Quantitative association rules induced from databases describe rich and hidden relationships holding within data that can prove useful for various application purposes (e.g., market basket analysis, customer profiling, and others). Even though such association rules are quite widely used in practice, a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of inducing them is missing. This paper intends to provide a contribution in this setting. To this end, we first formally define quantitative association rule mining problems, which entail boolean association rules as a special case, and then analyze their computational complexities, by considering both the standard cases, and a some special interesting case, that is, association rule induction over databases with null values, fixed-size attribute set databases, sparse databases, fixed threshold problems.",2001-11-06T15:42:06Z,2001-11-06T15:42:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0111009v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0111009v1,"cs.CC, F.2.0"

Anomalous Slow Diffusion from Perpetual Homogenization,Houman Owhadi,"This paper is concerned with the asymptotic behavior of solutions of stochastic differential equations $dy_t=d\omega_t -\nabla V(y_t) dt$, $y_0=0$.

Pointwise estimates are based on a new analytical inequality for sub-harmonic functions. When $d\geq 1$ and $V$ is periodic, quantitative estimates are obtained on the heat kernel of $y_t$, showing the rate at which homogenization takes place.

Motivated specifically by these problems of biological information, we propose here a class of measures to quantify the contextual nature of the information in sets of objects, based on Kolmogorov's intrinsic complexity.

The error term we establish matches the best current result for balls in symmetric spaces of simple higher-rank Lie groups, but holds in much greater generality. In addition, it holds uniformly over families of lattices satisfying a uniform spectral gap. Applications include counting lattice points in general domains in semisimple S-algebraic groups, counting rational points on group varieties with respect to a height function, and quantitative angular (or conical) equidistribution of lattice points in symmetric spaces and in affine symmetric varieties. The mean ergodic theorems which we establish are based on spectral methods, including the spectral transfer principle and the Kunze-Stein phenomenon.

This measure is particularly well suited for the detection of symmetry and modularity in the underlying structure, and allows for a quantitative definition of structural modularity. Furthermore we use our approach to show that symmetric and modular structures are favoured in biological self-assembly, for example of protein complexes. Lastly, we also introduce the notions of joint, mutual and conditional complexity, which provide a useful distance measure between physical structures.",2009-12-17T17:03:42Z,2010-01-12T12:05:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3464v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.3464v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.BM, q-bio.QM"
Quantitative relation between noise sensitivity and influences,"Nathan Keller, Guy Kindler","A Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ is said to be noise sensitive if inserting a small random error in its argument makes the value of the function almost unpredictable. Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm showed that if the sum of squares of influences in $f$ is close to zero then $f$ must be noise sensitive. We show a quantitative version of this result which does not depend on $n$, and prove that it is tight for certain parameters. Our results hold also for a general product measure $\mu_p$ on the discrete cube, as long as $\log 1/p \ll \log n$. We note that in [BKS], a quantitative relation between the sum of squares of the influences and the noise sensitivity was also shown, but only when the sum of squares is bounded by $n^{-c}$ for a constant $c$. Our results require a generalization of a lemma of Talagrand on the Fourier coefficients of monotone Boolean functions. In order to achieve it, we present a considerably shorter proof of Talagrand's lemma, which easily generalizes in various directions, including non-monotone functions.",2010-03-09T10:40:28Z,2010-03-09T10:40:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1839v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1839v1,"math.CO, math.PR, 05D40; 60C05; 06E30"
Quantitative Density under Higher Rank Abelian Algebraic Toral Actions,Zhiren Wang,"We generalize Bourgain-Lindenstrauss-Michel-Venkatesh's recent one-dimensional quantitative density result to abelian algebraic actions on higher dimensional tori. Up to finite index, the group actions that we study are conjugate to the action of $U_K$, the group of units of some non-CM number field $K$, on a compact quotient of $K\otimes_{\mathbb Q}\mathbb R$. In such a setting, we investigate how fast the orbit of a generic point can become dense in the torus. This effectivizes a special case of a theorem of Berend; and is deduced from a parallel measure-theoretical statement which effectivizes a special case of a result by Katok-Spatzier. In addition, we specify two numerical invariants of the group action that determine the quantitative behavior, which have number-theoretical significance.",2010-04-01T01:00:46Z,2010-04-01T01:00:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0035v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.0035v1,"math.DS, 37A45"
Quantitative estimates for the long time behavior of an ergodic variant   of the telegraph process,"Joaquin Fontbona, Hélène Guérin, Florent Malrieu","Motivated by stability questions on piecewise deterministic Markov models of bacterial chemotaxis, we study the long time behavior of a variant of the classic telegraph process having a non-constant jump rate that induces a drift towards the origin. We compute its invariant law and show exponential ergodicity, obtaining a quantitative control of the total variation distance to equilibrium at each instant of time. These results rely on an exact description of the excursions of the process away from the origin and on the explicit construction of an original coalescent coupling for both velocity and position. Sharpness of the obtained convergence rate is discussed.",2010-06-04T20:11:10Z,2012-04-25T20:31:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0982v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.0982v2,"math.PR, 60J25, 60J75, 92D25"
The Physics of Living Neural Networks,"Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Ofer Feinerman, Leor Gruendlinger, Elisha Moses, Jordi Soriano, Tsvi Tlusty","Improvements in technique in conjunction with an evolution of the theoretical and conceptual approach to neuronal networks provide a new perspective on living neurons in culture. Organization and connectivity are being measured quantitatively along with other physical quantities such as information, and are being related to function. In this review we first discuss some of these advances, which enable elucidation of structural aspects. We then discuss two recent experimental models that yield some conceptual simplicity. A one-dimensional network enables precise quantitative comparison to analytic models, for example of propagation and information transport. A two-dimensional percolating network gives quantitative information on connectivity of cultured neurons. The physical quantities that emerge as essential characteristics of the network in vitro are propagation speeds, synaptic transmission, information creation and capacity.

Snow metamorphism: a fractal approach,"Anna Carbone, Bernardino M. Chiaia, Barbara Frigo, Christian Turk","Snow is a porous disordered medium consisting of air and three water phases: ice, vapour and liquid. The ice phase consists of an assemblage of grains, ice matrix, initially arranged over a random load bearing skeleton. The quantitative relationship between density and morphological characteristics of different snow microstructures is still an open issue. In this work, a three-dimensional fractal description of density corresponding to different snow microstructure is put forward. First, snow density is simulated in terms of a generalized Menger sponge model. Then, a fully three-dimensional compact stochastic fractal model is adopted. The latter approach yields a quantitative map of the randomness of the snow texture, which is described as a three-dimensional fractional Brownian field with the Hurst exponent H varying as continuous parameter. The Hurst exponent is found to be strongly dependent on snow morphology and density. The approach might be applied to all those cases where the morphological evolution of snow cover or ice sheets should be conveniently described at a quantitative level.",2010-12-21T07:56:27Z,2010-12-21T07:56:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4563v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.4563v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.comp-ph"
QuantUM: Quantitative Safety Analysis of UML Models,"Florian Leitner-Fischer, Stefan Leue","When developing a safety-critical system it is essential to obtain an assessment of different design alternatives. In particular, an early safety assessment of the architectural design of a system is desirable. In spite of the plethora of available formal quantitative analysis methods it is still difficult for software and system architects to integrate these techniques into their every day work. This is mainly due to the lack of methods that can be directly applied to architecture level models, for instance given as UML diagrams. Also, it is necessary that the description methods used do not require a profound knowledge of formal methods. Our approach bridges this gap and improves the integration of quantitative safety analysis methods into the development process. All inputs of the analysis are specified at the level of a UML model. This model is then automatically translated into the analysis model, and the results of the analysis are consequently represented on the level of the UML model. Thus the analysis model and the formal methods used during the analysis are hidden from the user. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach using an industrial strength case study.",2011-07-06T17:54:32Z,2011-07-06T17:54:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1198v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.1198v1,"cs.SE, D.2.4;D.3.2;"

A semi-quantitative equivalence for abstracting from fast reactions,"Vashti Galpin, Jane Hillston, Federica Ciocchetta","Semantic equivalences are used in process algebra to capture the notion of similar behaviour, and this paper proposes a semi-quantitative equivalence for a stochastic process algebra developed for biological modelling. We consider abstracting away from fast reactions as suggested by the Quasi-Steady-State Assumption. We define a fast-slow bisimilarity based on this idea. We also show congruence under an appropriate condition for the cooperation operator of Bio-PEPA. The condition requires that there is no synchronisation over fast actions, and this distinguishes fast-slow bisimilarity from weak bisimilarity. We also show congruence for an operator which extends the reactions available for a species. We characterise models for which it is only necessary to consider the matching of slow transitions and we illustrate the equivalence on two models of competitive inhibition.",2011-09-07T06:27:23Z,2011-09-07T06:27:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1365v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.1365v1,"cs.CE, q-bio.QM"
Elementary processes governing the evolution of road networks,"Emanuele Strano, Vincenzo Nicosia, Vito Latora, Sergio Porta, Marc Barthelemy","Urbanisation is a fundamental phenomenon whose quantitative characterisation is still inadequate. We report here the empirical analysis of a unique data set regarding almost 200 years of evolution of the road network in a large area located north of Milan (Italy). We find that urbanisation is characterised by the homogenisation of cell shapes, and by the stability throughout time of high-centrality roads which constitute the backbone of the urban structure, confirming the importance of historical paths. We show quantitatively that the growth of the network is governed by two elementary processes: (i) `densification', corresponding to an increase in the local density of roads around existing urban centres and (ii) `exploration', whereby new roads trigger the spatial evolution of the urbanisation front. The empirical identification of such simple elementary mechanisms suggests the existence of general, simple properties of urbanisation and opens new directions for its modelling and quantitative description.",2012-03-01T15:17:17Z,2012-03-01T15:17:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0300v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0300v1,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn"
Fundamental Complexity Measures of Life,Attila Grandpierre,"At present, there is a great deal of confusion regarding complexity and its measures (reviews on complexity measures are found in, e.g. Lloyd, 2001 and Shalizi, 2006 and more references therein). Moreover, there is also confusion regarding the nature of life. In this situation, it seems the task of determining the fundamental complexity measures of life is especially difficult. Yet this task is just part of a greater task: obtaining substantial insights into the nature of biological evolution. We think that without a firm quantitative basis characterizing the most fundamental aspects of life, it is impossible to overcome the confusion so as to clarify the nature of biological evolution.

A previous work on this model showed that Nash equilibria (resp. secure equilibria) are guaranteed to exist in the multiplayer (resp. two-player) case. The existence of secure equilibria in the multiplayer case remained and is still an open problem. In this paper, we focus our study on the concept of subgame perfect equilibrium, a refinement of Nash equilibrium well-suited in the framework of games played on graphs. We also introduce the new concept of subgame perfect secure equilibrium.

Quantitative analysis of pedestrian counterflow in a cellular automaton   model,"Stefan Nowak, Andreas Schadschneider","Pedestrian dynamics exhibits various collective phenomena. Here we study bidirectional pedestrian flow in a floor field cellular automaton model. Under certain conditions, lane formation is observed. Although it has often been studied qualitatively, e.g., as a test for the realism of a model, there are almost no quantitative results, neither empirically nor theoretically. As basis for a quantitative analysis we introduce an order parameter which is adopted from the analysis of colloidal suspensions. This allows to determine a phase diagram for the system where four different states (free flow, disorder, lanes, gridlock) can be distinguished. Although the number of lanes formed is fluctuating, lanes are characterized by a typical density. It is found that the basic floor field model overestimates the tendency towards a gridlock compared to experimental bounds. Therefore an anticipation mechanism is introduced which reduces the jamming probability.",2012-06-14T12:26:16Z,2012-06-14T12:26:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3084v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3084v1,"physics.soc-ph, nlin.CG"

In the core of the paper we obtain quantitative pointwise lower estimates of the positivity of the solutions, depending only on the norm of the initial data in a certain ball. The estimates take a different form in three exponent ranges: slow diffusion, good range of fast diffusion, and very fast diffusion.

Noise-induced Regime Shifts: A Quantitative Characterization,"Sayantari Ghosh, Amit Kumar Pal, Indrani Bose","Diverse complex dynamical systems are known to exhibit abrupt regime shifts at bifurcation points of the saddle-node type. The dynamics of most of these systems, however, have a stochastic component resulting in noise driven regime shifts even if the system is away from the bifurcation points. In this paper, we propose a new quantitative measure, namely, the propensity transition point as an indicator of stochastic regime shifts. The concepts and the methodology are illustrated for the one-variable May model, a well-known model in ecology and the genetic toggle, a two-variable model of a simple genetic circuit. The general applicability and usefulness of the method for the analysis of regime shifts is further demonstrated in the case of the mycobacterial switch to persistence for which experimental data are available.",2012-12-21T10:25:41Z,2013-10-27T06:45:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5385v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5385v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.PE, q-bio.QM"

Characterization of the degree of Musical non-Markovianity,"Maria Mannone, Giuseppe Compagno","Recently, as an aid for musical analysis, in computational musicology mathematical and informatics tools have been developed to quantitatively characterize some aspects of musical compositions. To a musical composition can be attributed by ear a certain amount of memory. This results associated to repetitions and similarities of the patterns in musical scores. To higher variations, a lower amount of memory is perceived. However musical memory of a score has never been quantitatively defined. Here we aim to give such a measure following an approach similar to that used in Physics to quantify the memory (non-Markovianity) of open quantum systems. We have applied this measure to some existing musical compositions, showing that the results obtained via this quantifier agree with what one expects by ear. The Musical non-Markovianity quantifier can thus be used as a new tool that can aid quantitative musical analysis.",2013-06-02T17:02:27Z,2014-08-04T18:17:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0229v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.0229v2,"physics.data-an, quant-ph"
Friction as Contrast Mechanism in Heterodyne Force Microscopy,"G. J. Verbiest, T. H. Oosterkamp, M. J. Rost","The nondestructive imaging of subsurface structures on the nanometer scale has been a long-standing desire in both science and industry. A few impressive images were published so far that demonstrate the general feasibility by combining ultrasound with an Atomic Force Microscope. From different excitation schemes, Heterodyne Force Microscopy seems to be the most promising candidate delivering the highest contrast and resolution. However, the physical contrast mechanism is unknown, thereby preventing any quantitative analysis of samples. Here we show that friction at material boundaries within the sample is responsible for the contrast formation. This result is obtained by performing a full quantitative analysis, in which we compare our experimentally observed contrasts with simulations and calculations. Surprisingly, we can rule out all other generally believed responsible mechanisms, like Rayleigh scattering, sample (visco)elasticity, damping of the ultrasonic tip motion, and ultrasound attenuation.

Some Quantitative Results in Real Algebraic Geometry,Salvador Barone,"Real algebraic geometry is the study of semi-algebraic sets, subsets of $\R^k$ defined by Boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and inequalities. The focus of this thesis is to study quantitative results in real algebraic geometry, primarily upper bounds on the topological complexity of semi-algebraic sets as measured, for example, by their Betti numbers. Another quantitative measure of topological complexity which we study is the number of homotopy types of semi-algebraic sets of bounded description complexity. The description complexity of a semi-algebraic set depends on the context, but it is simply some measure of the complexity of the polynomials in the formula defining the semi-algebraic set (e.g., the degree and number of variables of a polynomial, the so called dense format). We also provide a description of the Hausdorff limit of a one-parameter family of semi-algebraic sets, up to homotopy type which the author hopes will find further use in the future. Finally, in the last chapter of this thesis, we prove a decomposition theorem similar to the well-known cylindrical decomposition for semi-algebraic sets but which has the advantage of requiring significantly less cells in the decomposition. The setting of this last result is not in semi-algebraic geometry, but in the more general setting of o-minimal structures.",2013-07-31T15:23:38Z,2013-07-31T15:23:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8353v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.8353v1,"math.AG, 14P10, 14P25"

It follows that the manifold can be embedded by a finite number of eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. Again, this number only depends on the geometric bounds and the dimension. In addition, both maps can be made arbitrarily close to an isometry. In the appendix, we derive quantitative estimates of the harmonic radius, so that the estimates on the number of eigenfunctions or heat kernels needed can be made quantitative as well.",2013-11-29T14:05:44Z,2014-07-23T11:13:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7568v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.7568v2,"math.DG, math.AP, 58J50, 58J35, 35P99"
A Quantitative Approach to Painting Styles,"Vilson Vieira, Renato Fabbri, David Sbrissa, Luciano da Fontoura Costa, Gonzalo Travieso","This research extends a method previously applied to music and philosophy,representing the evolution of art as a time-series where relations like dialectics are measured quantitatively. For that, a corpus of paintings of 12 well-known artists from baroque and modern art is analyzed. A set of 93 features is extracted and the features which most contributed to the classification of painters are selected. The projection space obtained provides the basis to the analysis of measurements. This quantitative measures underlie revealing observations about the evolution of painting styles, specially when compared with other humanity fields already analyzed: while music evolved along a master-apprentice tradition (high dialectics) and philosophy by opposition, painting presents another pattern: constant increasing skewness, low opposition between members of the same movement and opposition peaks in the transition between movements. Differences between baroque and modern movements are also observed in the projected ""painting space"": while baroque paintings are presented as an overlapped cluster, the modern paintings present minor overlapping and are disposed more widely in the projection than the baroque counterparts.

Underestimating extreme events in power-law behavior due to   machine-dependent cutoffs,Filippo Radicchi,"Power-law distributions are typical macroscopic features occurring in almost all complex systems observable in nature. As a result, researchers in quantitative analyses must often generate random synthetic variates obeying power-law distributions. The task is usually performed through standard methods that map uniform random variates into the desired probability space. Whereas all these algorithms are theoretically solid, in this paper we show that they are subject to severe machine-dependent limitations. As a result, two dramatic consequences arise: (i) the sampling in the tail of the distribution is not random but deterministic; (ii) the moments of the sample distribution, which are theoretically expected to diverge as functions of the sample sizes, converge instead to finite values. We provide quantitative indications for the range of distribution parameters that can be safely handled by standard libraries used in computational analyses. Whereas our findings indicate possible reinterpretations of numerical results obtained through flawed sampling methodologies, they also pave the way for the search for a concrete solution to this central issue shared by all quantitative sciences dealing with complexity.",2014-04-30T23:40:52Z,2014-11-03T22:33:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0058v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0058v2,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, stat.CO"

The minimum number of tests achievable by nested test plans was established by Aigner and Schughart in 1985 within a minimax framework. The optimal nested test plan offering this performance, however, was not obtained. In this work, we establish the optimal nested test plan in closed form. This optimal nested test plan is also order optimal among all test plans as the population size approaches infinity.

Minimum Contamination and $β$-Aberration Criteria for Screening   Quantitative Factors,"Po Yang, Chang-Yun Lin","Tang and Xu [Biometrika 101 (2014) 333-350] applied the minimum $\beta$-aberration criterion to selecting optimal designs for screening quantitative factors. They provided a statistical justification showing that minimum $\beta$-aberration criterion minimizes contamination of nonnegligible $k$th-order effects on the estimation of linear effects for $k=2,\cdots,r$, where $r$ is the strength of a design. Unfortunately, this result does not hold for $k>r$. In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical connection between $\beta$-wordlength patterns and contaminations (on the estimation of linear effects) and reveal that the minimum $\beta$-aberration criterion is not necessarily equivalent to the minimum contamination criterion for ranking designs. We prove that they are equivalent only when the number of factors of a design equals the strength plus one. We emphasize that the minimum $\beta$-aberration criterion, in fact, sequentially minimizes the contamination of nonnegligible $k$th-order effects on the estimation of the general mean, not on the estimation of linear effects. Therefore, the minimum contamination criterion should be more appropriate than the minimum $\beta$-aberration criterion for selecting optimal designs for screening quantitative factors.",2014-09-03T09:55:07Z,2014-09-03T09:55:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1012v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1012v1,"math.ST, stat.TH"

In previous work, we identified the most common specification patterns related to provisioning service-based applications and developed an expressive specification language (SOLOIST) that supports them. SOLOIST is an extension of metric temporal logic with aggregate temporal modalities that can be used to write quantitative temporal properties.   In this paper we address the problem of performing offline checking of service execution traces against quantitative requirements specifications written in SOLOIST. We present a translation of SOLOIST into CLTLB(D), a variant of linear temporal logic, and reduce the trace checking of SOLOIST to bounded satisfiability checking of CLTLB(D), which is supported by ZOT, an SMT-based verification toolkit. We detail the results of applying the proposed offline trace checking procedure to different types of traces, and compare its performance with previous work.",2014-09-16T14:23:17Z,2014-09-16T14:23:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4653v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4653v1,"cs.SE, D.2.4"
Replicate immunosequencing as a robust probe of B cell repertoire   diversity,"William DeWitt, Paul Lindau, Thomas Snyder, Marissa Vignali, Ryan Emerson, Harlan Robins","Fundamental to quantitative characterization of the B cell receptor repertoire is clonal diversity - the number of distinct somatically recombined receptors present in the repertoire and their relative abundances, defining the search space available for immune response. This study synthesizes flow cytometry and immunosequencing to study memory and naive B cells from the peripheral blood of three adults. A combinatorial experimental design was employed, constituting a sample abundance probe robust to amplification stochasticity, a crucial quantitative advance over previous sequencing studies of diversity. These data are leveraged to interrogate repertoire diversity, motivating an extension of a canonical diversity model in ecology and corpus linguistics. Maximum likelihood diversity estimates are provided for memory and naive B cell repertoires. Both evince domination by rare clones and regimes of power law scaling in abundance. Memory clones have more disparate repertoire abundances than naive clones, and most naive clones undergo no proliferation prior to antigen recognition.",2014-10-01T19:59:11Z,2014-10-01T19:59:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0350v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0350v1,"q-bio.QM, stat.AP"
Structural operational semantics for non-deterministic processes with   quantitative aspects,"Marino Miculan, Marco Peressotti","General frameworks have been recently proposed as unifying theories for processes combining non-determinism with quantitative aspects (such as probabilistic or stochastically timed executions), aiming to provide general results and tools. This paper provides two contributions in this respect. First, we present a general GSOS specification format and a corresponding notion of bisimulation for non-deterministic processes with quantitative aspects. These specifications define labelled transition systems according to the ULTraS model, an extension of the usual LTSs where the transition relation associates any source state and transition label with state reachability weight functions (like, e.g., probability distributions). This format, hence called Weight Function GSOS (WF-GSOS), covers many known systems and their bisimulations (e.g. PEPA, TIPP, PCSP) and GSOS formats (e.g. GSOS, Weighted GSOS, Segala-GSOS, among others).   The second contribution is a characterization of these systems as coalgebras of a class of functors, parametric on the weight structure. This result allows us to prove soundness and completeness of the WF-GSOS specification format, and that bisimilarities induced by these specifications are always congruences.",2014-10-03T16:06:32Z,2015-06-30T14:37:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0893v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0893v2,"cs.LO, F.1.2; F.3.2"
A typology of street patterns,"Rémi Louf, Marc Barthelemy","We propose a quantitative method to classify cities according to their street pattern. We use the conditional probability distribution of shape factor of blocks with a given area, and define what could constitute the `fingerprint' of a city. Using a simple hierarchical clustering method, these fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a typology of cities. We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe 4 large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different Boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterising the different neighbourhoods inside a city. This method provides a quantitative comparison of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind their distinct shapes.",2014-10-08T13:08:01Z,2014-10-08T13:08:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2094v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2094v1,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn"
Analysis of the expected density of internal equilibria in random   evolutionary multi-player multi-strategy games,"Manh Hong Duong, The Anh Han","In this paper, we study the distribution and behaviour of internal equilibria in a $d$-player $n$-strategy random evolutionary game where the game payoff matrix is generated from normal distributions. The study of this paper reveals and exploits interesting connections between evolutionary game theory and random polynomial theory. The main novelties of the paper are some qualitative and quantitative results on the expected density, $f_{n,d}$, and the expected number, $E(n,d)$, of (stable) internal equilibria. Firstly, we show that in multi-player two-strategy games, they behave asymptotically as $\sqrt{d-1}$ as $d$ is sufficiently large. Secondly, we prove that they are monotone functions of $d$. We also make a conjecture for games with more than two strategies. Thirdly, we provide numerical simulations for our analytical results and to support the conjecture. As consequences of our analysis, some qualitative and quantitative results on the distribution of zeros of a random Bernstein polynomial are also obtained.",2015-05-18T15:15:33Z,2016-03-26T22:04:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04676v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04676v3,"math.AP, math.DS, math.PR, q-bio.PE, q-bio.QM"
Regularized quantile regression under heterogeneous sparsity with   application to quantitative genetic traits,"Qianchuan He, Linglong Kong, Yanhua Wang, Sijian Wang, Timothy A. Chan, Eric Holland","Genetic studies often involve quantitative traits. Identifying genetic features that influence quantitative traits can help to uncover the etiology of diseases. Quantile regression method considers the conditional quantiles of the response variable, and is able to characterize the underlying regression structure in a more comprehensive manner. On the other hand, genetic studies often involve high dimensional genomic features, and the underlying regression structure may be heterogeneous in terms of both effect sizes and sparsity. To account for the potential genetic heterogeneity, including the heterogeneous sparsity, a regularized quantile regression method is introduced. The theoretical property of the proposed method is investigated, and its performance is examined through a series of simulation studies.

Quantitative Volume Space Form Rigidity Under Lower Ricci Curvature   Bound,"Lina Chen, Xiaochun Rong, Shicheng Xu","Let $M$ be a compact $n$-manifold of $\operatorname{Ric}_M\ge (n-1)H$ ($H$ is a constant). We are concerned with the following space form rigidity: $M$ is isometric to a space form of constant curvature $H$ under either of the following conditions:   (i) There is $\rho>0$ such that for any $x\in M$, the open $\rho$-ball at $x^*$ in the (local) Riemannian universal covering space, $(U^*_\rho,x^*)\to (B_\rho(x),x)$, has the maximal volume i.e., the volume of a $\rho$-ball in the simply connected $n$-space form of curvature $H$.   (ii) For $H=-1$, the volume entropy of $M$ is maximal i.e. $n-1$ ([LW1]).   The main results of this paper are quantitative space form rigidity i.e., statements that $M$ is diffeomorphic and close in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a space form of constant curvature $H$, if $M$ almost satisfies, under some additional condition, the above maximal volume condition. For $H=1$, the quantitative spherical space form rigidity improves and generalizes the diffeomorphic sphere theorem in [CC2].",2016-04-24T05:32:12Z,2023-08-24T06:34:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06986v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06986v3,"math.DG, 53C20, 53C24"
Factor Models for Cancer Signatures,"Zura Kakushadze, Willie Yu","We present a novel method for extracting cancer signatures by applying statistical risk models (http://ssrn.com/abstract=2732453) from quantitative finance to cancer genome data. Using 1389 whole genome sequenced samples from 14 cancers, we identify an ""overall"" mode of somatic mutational noise. We give a prescription for factoring out this noise and source code for fixing the number of signatures. We apply nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to genome data aggregated by cancer subtype and filtered using our method. The resultant signatures have substantially lower variability than those from unfiltered data. Also, the computational cost of signature extraction is cut by about a factor of 10. We find 3 novel cancer signatures, including a liver cancer dominant signature (96% contribution) and a renal cell carcinoma signature (70% contribution). Our method accelerates finding new cancer signatures and improves their overall stability. Reciprocally, the methods for extracting cancer signatures could have interesting applications in quantitative finance.",2016-04-29T09:11:34Z,2017-01-23T04:47:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08743v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08743v4,"q-bio.GN, q-bio.QM, q-fin.ST"
Challenges in Quantitative Abstractions for Collective Adaptive Systems,Mirco Tribastone,"Like with most large-scale systems, the evaluation of quantitative properties of collective adaptive systems is an important issue that crosscuts all its development stages, from design (in the case of engineered systems) to runtime monitoring and control. Unfortunately it is a difficult problem to tackle in general, due to the typically high computational cost involved in the analysis. This calls for the development of appropriate quantitative abstraction techniques that preserve most of the system's dynamical behaviour using a more compact representation. This paper focuses on models based on ordinary differential equations and reviews recent results where abstraction is achieved by aggregation of variables, reflecting on the shortcomings in the state of the art and setting out challenges for future research.",2016-07-08T05:36:45Z,2016-07-08T05:36:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02966v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02966v1,"cs.SY, cs.LO, cs.PF, F.1.1"
Vortex arrays and ciliary tangles underlie the feeding-swimming tradeoff   in starfish larvae,"William Gilpin, Vivek N. Prakash, Manu Prakash","Many marine invertebrates have larval stages covered in linear arrays of beating cilia, which propel the animal while simultaneously entraining planktonic prey. These bands are strongly conserved across taxa spanning four major superphyla, and they are responsible for the unusual morphologies of many invertebrate larvae. However, few studies have investigated their underlying hydrodynamics. Here, we study the ciliary bands of starfish larvae, and discover a beautiful pattern of slowly-evolving vortices that surrounds the swimming animals. Closer inspection of the bands reveals unusual ciliary ""tangles"" analogous to topological defects that break up and re-form as the animal adjusts its swimming stroke. Quantitative experiments and modeling demonstrate that these vortices create a physical tradeoff between feeding and swimming in heterogenous environments, which manifests as distinct flow patterns or ""eigen-strokes"" representing each behavior---potentially implicating neuronal control of cilia. This quantitative interplay between larval form and hydrodynamic function may generalize to other invertebrates with ciliary bands, and illustrates the potential effects of active boundary conditions in other biological and synthetic systems.",2016-11-03T20:10:14Z,2017-02-13T01:12:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01173v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01173v2,"physics.flu-dyn, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Pion Fluctuation in High Energy Collisions - A Chaos-based Quantitative   Estimation with Visibility Graph Technique,"Susmita Bhaduri, Dipak Ghosh","We propose a new approach for studying pion fluctuation for deeper understanding of the dynamical process involved, from a perspective of fBm-based complex network analysis method called Visibility graph Analysis. This chaos-based, rigorous, non-linear technique is applied to study the erratic behavior of multipion production in \pi^{-}-Ag/Br interactions at 350 GeV. This method can offer reliable results with finite data points. The Power of Scale-freeness of Visibility Graph denoted by-PSVG is a measure of fractality, which can be used as a quantitative parameter for the assessment of the state of a chaotic system. The event-wise fluctuation of the multipion production process can be described by this parameter-PSVG. From the analysis of the PSVG parameter, we can quantitatively confirm that fractal behavior of the particle production process depends on the target excitation and also the fractality decreases with the increase of target excitation.",2016-11-14T09:11:53Z,2016-11-16T09:07:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04290v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04290v2,"hep-ex, physics.data-an"
Phototaxis beyond turning: persistent accumulation and response   acclimation of the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Jorge Arrieta, Ana Barreira, Maurizio Chioccioli, Marco Polin, Idan Tuval","Phototaxis is an important reaction to light displayed by a wide range of motile microorganisms. Flagellated eukaryotic microalgae in particular, like the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, steer either towards or away from light by a rapid and precisely timed modulation of their flagellar activity. Cell steering, however, is only the beginning of a much longer process which ultimately allows cells to determine their light exposure history. This process is not well understood. Here we present a first quantitative study of the long timescale phototactic motility of Chlamydomonas at both single cell and population levels. Our results reveal that the phototactic strategy adopted by these microorganisms leads to an efficient exposure to light, and that the phototactic response is modulated over typical timescales of tens of seconds. The adaptation dynamics for phototaxis and chlorophyll fluorescence show a striking quantitative agreement, suggesting that photosynthesis controls quantitatively how cells navigate a light field.",2016-11-24T15:39:07Z,2016-11-24T15:39:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08224v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08224v1,"q-bio.CB, cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph"
Quantitative modeling and analysis of bifurcation-induced bursting,"J. E. Rubin, B. Krauskopf, H. M.

Moreover, selecting a suitable model complexity requires a sufficient understanding of the model's potential use, such as highlighting essential mechanisms underlying qualitative behavior or precisely quantifying realistic dynamics. We present a novel approach that can guide model development and tuning to achieve desired qualitative and quantitative solution properties. Our approach relies on the presence of disparate time scales and employs techniques of separating the dynamics of fast and slow variables, which are well known in the analysis of qualitative solution features. We build on these methods to show how it is also possible to obtain quantitative solution features by imposing designed dynamics for the slow variables in the form of specified two-dimensional paths in a bifurcation-parameter landscape.",2017-01-20T04:30:47Z,2017-01-20T04:30:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05685v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05685v1,"math.DS, nlin.CD, q-bio.NC"

Quantitative homogenization in nonlinear elasticity for small loads,"Stefan Neukamm, Mathias Schäffner","We study quantitative periodic homogenization of integral functionals in the context of non-linear elasticity. Under suitable assumptions on the energy densities (in particular frame indifference; minimality, non-degeneracy and smoothness at the identity; $p\geq d$-growth from below; and regularity of the microstructure), we show that in a neighborhood of the set of rotations, the multi-cell homogenization formula of non-convex homogenization reduces to a single-cell formula. The latter can be expressed with help of correctors. We prove that the homogenized integrand admits a quadratic Taylor expansion in an open neighborhood of the rotations -- a result that can be interpreted as the fact that homogenization and linearization commute close to the rotations. Moreover, for small applied loads, we provide an estimate on the homogenization error in terms of a quantitative two-scale expansion.",2017-03-23T07:12:03Z,2017-03-23T07:12:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07947v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07947v1,"math.AP, 35B40, 35J60, 74Q05, 35B27, 74B20"
Growth strategy of microbes on mixed carbon sources,"Xin Wang, Kang Xia, Xiaojing Yang, Chao Tang","A classic problem in microbiology is that bacteria display two types of growth behavior when cultured on a mixture of two carbon sources: the two sources are sequentially consumed one after another (diauxie) or they are simultaneously consumed (co-utilization). The search for the molecular mechanism of diauxie led to the discovery of the lac operon. However, questions remain as why microbes would bother to have different strategies of taking up nutrients. Here we show that diauxie versus co-utilization can be understood from the topological features of the metabolic network. A model of optimal allocation of protein resources quantitatively explains why and how the cell makes the choice. In case of co-utilization, the model predicts the percentage of each carbon source in supplying the amino acid pools, which is quantitatively verified by experiments.

Given the scattering coefficient, an improved fixed-point iterative method is proposed to retrieve the absorption coefficient for its cheap computational cost. And we prove the convergence. To retrieve two coefficients simultaneously, Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method is applied. Since the reconstruction of optical coefficients involves the solution of original and adjoint RTEs in the framework of optimization, an efficient solver with high accuracy is improved from~\cite{Gao}.

Here we present color spatial light interference microscopy (cSLIM) as a new whole slide imaging modality that performs interferometric imaging with a color detector array. As a result, cSLIM yields in a single scan both the intrinsic tissue phase map and the standard color bright-field image, familiar to the pathologist. Our results on 196 breast cancer patients indicate that cSLIM can provide not only diagnostic but also prognostic information from the alignment of collagen fibers in the tumor microenvironment.

Quantitative unique continuation for Schrödinger operators,Blair Davey,"We investigate the quantitative unique continuation properties of solutions to second order elliptic equations with singular lower order terms. The main theorem presents a quantification of the strong unique continuation property for $\Delta + V$.

Our results apply to all $t > \frac n 2$ and $n \ge 3$. With these maximal order of vanishing estimates, we employ a scaling argument to produce quantitative unique continuation at infinity estimates for global solutions to $\Delta u + V u = 0$. To handle $V \in L^t$ for every $t \in (\frac n 2, \infty]$, we prove a novel $L^p - L^q$ Carleman estimate by interpolating a known $L^p - L^2$ estimate with a new endpoint Carleman estimate. This new Carleman estimate may also be used to establish improved order of vanishing estimates for equations with a first order term, those of the form $\Delta u + W \cdot \nabla u + V u = 0$.",2019-03-10T16:30:14Z,2019-03-10T16:30:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04021v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04021v1,"math.AP, 35J15, 35J10, 35A02"
Quantitative bounds for critically bounded solutions to the   Navier-Stokes equations,Terence Tao,"We revisit the regularity theory of Escauriaza, Seregin, and \v{S}ver\'ak for solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations which are uniformly bounded in the critical $L^3_x(\mathbf{R}^3)$ norm. By replacing all invocations of compactness methods in these arguments with quantitative substitutes, and similarly replacing unique continuation and backwards uniqueness estimates by their corresponding Carleman inequalities, we obtain quantitative bounds for higher regularity norms of these solutions in terms of the critical $L^3_x$ bound (with a dependence that is triple exponential in nature). In particular, we show that as one approaches a finite blowup time $T_*$, the critical $L^3_x$ norm must blow up at a rate $(\log\log\log \frac{1}{T_*-t})^c$ or faster for an infinite sequence of times approaching $T_*$ and some absolute constant $c>0$.",2019-08-14T05:22:30Z,2020-07-10T04:41:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04958v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04958v2,"math.AP, 35Q35, 37N10, 76B99"
Quantitative Kinetic Models from Intravital Microcopy: A Case Study   Using Hepatic Transport,"Meysam Tavakoli, Konstantinos Tsekouras, Richard Day, Kenneth W. Dunn, Steve Presse","The liver performs critical physiological functions, including metabolizing and removing substances, such as toxins and drugs, from the bloodstream. Hepatotoxicity itself is intimately linked to abnormal hepatic transport and hepatotoxicity remains the primary reason drugs in development fail and approved drugs are withdrawn from the market. For this reason, we propose to analyze, across liver compartments, the transport kinetics of fluorescein-a fluorescent marker used as a proxy for drug molecules-using intravital microscopy data. To resolve the transport kinetics quantitatively from fluorescence data, we account for the effect that different liver compartments (with different chemical properties) have on fluorescein's emission rate. To do so, we develop ordinary differential equation transport models from the data where the kinetics are related to the observable fluorescence levels by ""measurement parameters"" that vary across different liver compartments. On account of the steep non-linearities in the kinetics and stochasticity inherent to the model, we infer kinetic and measurement parameters by generalizing the method of parameter cascades. For this application, the method of parameter cascades ensures fast and precise parameter estimates from noisy time traces.",2019-08-28T06:25:34Z,2019-08-28T06:25:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10564v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10564v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Unsupervised Clustering of Quantitative Imaging Phenotypes using   Autoencoder and Gaussian Mixture Model,"Jianan Chen, Laurent Milot, Helen M. C. Cheung, Anne L. Martel","Quantitative medical image computing (radiomics) has been widely applied to build prediction models from medical images. However, overfitting is a significant issue in conventional radiomics, where a large number of radiomic features are directly used to train and test models that predict genotypes or clinical outcomes. In order to tackle this problem, we propose an unsupervised learning pipeline composed of an autoencoder for representation learning of radiomic features and a Gaussian mixture model based on minimum message length criterion for clustering. By incorporating probabilistic modeling, disease heterogeneity has been taken into account. The performance of the proposed pipeline was evaluated on an institutional MRI cohort of 108 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Our approach is capable of automatically selecting the optimal number of clusters and assigns patients into clusters (imaging subtypes) with significantly different survival rates. Our method outperforms other unsupervised clustering methods that have been used for radiomics analysis and has comparable performance to a state-of-the-art imaging biomarker.",2019-09-06T15:00:24Z,2019-09-06T15:00:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02953v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02953v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.QM"
GSOS for non-deterministic processes with quantitative aspects,"Marino Miculan, Marco Peressotti","Recently, some general frameworks have been proposed as unifying theories for processes combining non-determinism with quantitative aspects (such as probabilistic or stochastically timed executions), aiming to provide general results and tools. This paper provides two contributions in this respect. First, we present a general GSOS specification format (and a corresponding notion of bisimulation) for non-deterministic processes with quantitative aspects. These specifications define labelled transition systems according to the ULTraS model, an extension of the usual LTSs where the transition relation associates any source state and transition label with state reachability weight functions (like, e.g., probability distributions). This format, hence called Weight Function SOS (WFSOS), covers many known systems and their bisimulations (e.g. PEPA, TIPP, PCSP) and GSOS formats (e.g. GSOS, Weighted GSOS, Segala-GSOS, among others).   The second contribution is a characterization of these systems as coalgebras of a class of functors, parametric on the weight structure. This result allows us to prove soundness of the WFSOS specification format, and that bisimilarities induced by these specifications are always congruences.",2014-06-09T03:47:46Z,2014-06-09T03:47:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2066v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2066v1,"cs.LO, cs.PL, F.3.2"
Qualitative and Quantitative Stability Analysis of Penta-rhythmic   Circuits,"Justus T. C. Schwabedal, Drake E. Knapper, A. L.

We present a qualitative and quantitative stability analysis of such a circuit constituted by three reciprocally coupled oscillators of a Fitzhugh-Nagumo type as nodes. Depending on inhibitory strengths, and parameters of individual oscillators, the circuit exhibits polyrhythmicity of up to five simultaneously stable rhythms. With methods of bifurcation analysis and phase reduction, we investigate qualitative changes in stability of these circuit rhythms for a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, we quantify how robustly rhythms are maintained under random perturbations by monitoring phase diffusion in the circuit. Our findings allow us to describe how circuit dynamics relate to dynamics of individual nodes.

A Quantitative Analysis of the Effect of Batch Normalization on Gradient   Descent,"Yongqiang Cai, Qianxiao Li, Zuowei Shen","Despite its empirical success and recent theoretical progress, there generally lacks a quantitative analysis of the effect of batch normalization (BN) on the convergence and stability of gradient descent. In this paper, we provide such an analysis on the simple problem of ordinary least squares (OLS). Since precise dynamical properties of gradient descent (GD) is completely known for the OLS problem, it allows us to isolate and compare the additional effects of BN. More precisely, we show that unlike GD, gradient descent with BN (BNGD) converges for arbitrary learning rates for the weights, and the convergence remains linear under mild conditions. Moreover, we quantify two different sources of acceleration of BNGD over GD -- one due to over-parameterization which improves the effective condition number and another due having a large range of learning rates giving rise to fast descent. These phenomena set BNGD apart from GD and could account for much of its robustness properties. These findings are confirmed quantitatively by numerical experiments, which further show that many of the uncovered properties of BNGD in OLS are also observed qualitatively in more complex supervised learning problems.",2018-09-29T00:50:21Z,2019-05-09T03:04:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00122v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00122v2,"cs.LG, stat.ML"

In this paper we give sharp quantitative estimates of proximity to a single sphere for Alexandrov Soap Bubble Theorem in space forms when the curvature operator $f$ is close to a constant. Under an assumption that prevents bubbling, the proximity to a single sphere is quantified in terms of the oscillation of the curvature function $f$.

Quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for $S$-arithmetic quadratic forms of   rank $3$ and $4$,Jiyoung Han,"The celebrated result of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (1998) and Dani and Margulis (1993) on quantitative Oppenheim conjecture says that for irrational quadratic forms $q$ of rank at least 5, the number of integral vectors $\mathbf v$ such that $q(\mathbf v)$ is in a given bounded interval is asymptotically equal to the volume of the set of real vectors $\mathbf v$ such that $q(\mathbf v)$ is in the same interval.   In dimension $3$ or $4$, there are exceptional quadratic forms which fail to satisfy the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture.

To overcome these limitations, a non-locally encoder-decoder gated convolutional neural network is trained to infer whole brain susceptibility map, using the local field and brain mask as the inputs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated relative to synthetic data, a publicly available challenge dataset, and clinical datasets. The proposed approach can outperform existing methods on quantitative metrics and visual assessment of image sharpness and streaking artifacts.

However, any well-established quantitative method relies on theoretical frameworks for both construction and analysis. While the computational aspects of agent-based modelling have been detailed in existing literature, the underlying theoretical basis has rarely been used in its construction. In this exposition, we provide an overview of the theoretical foundation of agent-based modelling and establish a relationship with its computational implementation. In addition to detailing the main characteristics of this computational methodology, we illustrate its application to simulating the spread of an infectious disease in a simple, dynamical process.

Quantitative Understanding of VAE as a Non-linearly Scaled Isometric   Embedding,"Akira Nakagawa, Keizo Kato, Taiji Suzuki","Variational autoencoder (VAE) estimates the posterior parameters (mean and variance) of latent variables corresponding to each input data. While it is used for many tasks, the transparency of the model is still an underlying issue. This paper provides a quantitative understanding of VAE property through the differential geometric and information-theoretic interpretations of VAE. According to the Rate-distortion theory, the optimal transform coding is achieved by using an orthonormal transform with PCA basis where the transform space is isometric to the input. Considering the analogy of transform coding to VAE, we clarify theoretically and experimentally that VAE can be mapped to an implicit isometric embedding with a scale factor derived from the posterior parameter. As a result, we can estimate the data probabilities in the input space from the prior, loss metrics, and corresponding posterior parameters, and further, the quantitative importance of each latent variable can be evaluated like the eigenvalue of PCA.",2020-07-30T02:37:46Z,2023-02-22T07:05:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15190v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15190v4,"stat.ML, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT, I.2.4"

Our estimates in particular ensure the invertibility, with quantitative bounds in the frequency, of the merge operators required to reconstruct the original Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator in terms of these impedance-to-impedance operators of the sub-domains.

Ice Nucleation on Carbon Surface Supports the Classical Theory for   Heterogeneous Nucleation,"Raffaela Cabriolu, Tianshu Li","The prevalence of heterogeneous nucleation in nature was explained qualitatively by the classical theory for heterogeneous nucleation established over more than 60 years ago, but the quantitative validity and the key conclusions of the theory have remained unconfirmed. Employing the forward flux sampling method and the coarse-grained water model mW, we explicitly computed the heterogeneous ice nucleation rates in the supercooled water on a graphitic surface at various temperatures. The independently calculated ice nucleation rates were found to fit well according to the classical theory for heterogeneous nucleation. The fitting procedure further yields the estimate of the potency factor which measures the ratio of the heterogeneous nucleation barrier to the homogeneous nucleation barrier. Remarkably, the estimated potency factor agrees quantitatively with the volumetric ratio of the critical nuclei between the heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation. Our numerical study thus provides a strong support to the quantitative power of the theory, and allows understanding ice nucleation behaviors under the most relevant freezing conditions.",2015-04-01T20:37:58Z,2015-04-06T21:05:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00379v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00379v2,"physics.chem-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"

Until now, the interaction graphs framework has been shown to deal with exponentials for the constrained system ELL (Elementary Linear Logic) while keeping its quantitative aspect. Adapting older constructions by Girard, one can clearly define ""full"" exponentials, but at the cost of these quantitative features.

In this work, we propose a generative approach to model the joint distribution of the QQ responses and predictors. The proposed generative model provides efficient parameter estimation under a penalized likelihood framework. It achieves accurate classification for qualitative response and accurate prediction for quantitative response with efficient computation.

Next, we measure cells' gradient-climbing speeds and the rate of information acquisition by the chemotaxis pathway. We find that E. coli make behavioral decisions with much less than the 1 bit required to determine whether they are swimming up-gradient.

A Characterization of the DNA Data Storage Channel,"Reinhard Heckel, Gediminas Mikutis, Robert N.

However, due to technological constraints, data can only be written onto many short DNA molecules that are stored in an unordered way, and can only be read by sampling from this DNA pool. Moreover, imperfections in writing (synthesis), reading (sequencing), storage, and handling of the DNA, in particular amplification via PCR, lead to a loss of DNA molecules and induce errors within the molecules. In order to design DNA storage systems, a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the errors and the loss of molecules is crucial. In this paper, we characterize those error probabilities by analyzing data from our own experiments as well as from experiments of two different groups. We find that errors within molecules are mainly due to synthesis and sequencing, while imperfections in handling and storage lead to a significant loss of sequences.

Using the TF-MIM, we have visualized the evolution of nanoscale conductance on back-gated $MoS_2$ field effect transistors and the results are consistent with the transport data.

Quantitative stability in the geometry of semi-discrete optimal   transport,"Mohit Bansil, Jun Kitagawa","We show quantitative stability results for the geometric ""cells"" arising in semi-discrete optimal transport problems. Our results show two types of stability, the first is stability of the associated Laguerre cells in measure, without any connectedness or regularity assumptions on the source measure. The second is stability in Hausdorff measure, under a Poincar{\`e}-Wirtinger inequality and a regularity assumption equivalent to the Ma-Trudinger-Wang conditions of regularity in Monge-Amp{\`e}re. This last result also yields stability in the uniform norm of the dual potential functions, all three stability results come with explicit quantitative bounds.

AutoAlpha: an Efficient Hierarchical Evolutionary Algorithm for Mining   Alpha Factors in Quantitative Investment,"Tianping Zhang, Yuanqi Li, Yifei Jin, Jian Li","The multi-factor model is a widely used model in quantitative investment. The success of a multi-factor model is largely determined by the effectiveness of the alpha factors used in the model. This paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm called AutoAlpha to automatically generate effective formulaic alphas from massive stock datasets. Specifically, first we discover an inherent pattern of the formulaic alphas and propose a hierarchical structure to quickly locate the promising part of space for search. Then we propose a new Quality Diversity search based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA-QD) to guide the search away from the well-explored space for more desirable results. Next, we utilize the warm start method and the replacement method to prevent the premature convergence problem. Based on the formulaic alphas we discover, we propose an ensemble learning-to-rank model for generating the portfolio. The backtests in the Chinese stock market and the comparisons with several baselines further demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoAlpha in mining formulaic alphas for quantitative trading.",2020-02-09T02:26:05Z,2020-04-04T04:27:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08245v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08245v2,"q-fin.CP, I.2.8"
Quantitative estimate of the continuum approximations of interacting   particle systems in one dimension,"Masato Kimura, Patrick van Meurs","We consider a large class of interacting particle systems in 1D described by an energy whose interaction potential is singular and non-local. This class covers Riesz gases (in particular, log gases) and applications to plasticity and approximation theory of functions. While it is well established that the minimisers of such interaction energies converge to a certain particle density profile as the number of particles tends to infinity, any bound on the rate of this convergence is only known in special cases by means of quantitative estimates. The main result of this paper extends these quantitative estimates to a large class of interaction energies by a different proof. The proof relies on one-dimensional features such as the convexity of the interaction potential and the ordering of the particles. The main novelty of the proof is the treatment of the singularity of the interaction potential by means of a carefully chosen renormalisation.",2020-02-27T02:22:03Z,2020-10-23T23:43:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11876v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11876v2,"math.AP, 82C22, 74Q05, 35A15, 74G10"
Improving Baseline Subtraction for Increased Sensitivity of Quantitative   PCR Measurements,"Paul N. Patrone, Anthony J. Kearsley, Erica L. Romsos, Peter M.

In particular, we present an algorithm that leverages information obtained from non-template and/or DNA extraction-control experiments to remove systematic bias from amplification curves. We recast this problem in terms of mathematical optimization, i.e. by finding the amount of control signal that, when subtracted from an amplification curve, minimizes background noise. We demonstrate that this approach can yield a decade improvement in sensitivity relative to standard approaches, especially for data exhibiting late-cycle amplification. Critically, this increased sensitivity and accuracy promises more effective screening of viral DNA and a reduction in the rate of false-negatives in diagnostic settings.",2020-04-11T19:17:35Z,2020-04-11T19:17:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05466v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05466v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det"
Approximately Optimal Controllers for Quantitative Two-Phase Reach-Avoid   Problems on Nonlinear Systems,"Alexander Weber, Alexander Knoll","The present work deals with quantitative two-phase reach-avoid problems on nonlinear control systems. This class of optimal control problem requires the plant's state to visit two (rather than one) target sets in succession while minimizing a prescribed cost functional. As we illustrate, the naive approach, which subdivides the problem into the two evident classical reach-avoid tasks, usually does not result in an optimal solution. In contrast, we prove that an optimal controller is obtained by consecutively solving two special quantitative reach-avoid problems. In addition, we present a fully-automated method based on Symbolic Optimal Control to practically synthesize for the considered problem class approximately optimal controllers for sampled-data nonlinear plants.

On SCC-recursiveness in Quantitative Argumentation,"Zongshun Wang, Yuping Shen","Abstract argumentation is a reasoning model for evaluating arguments based on various semantics. SCC-recursiveness is a sophisticated property of semantics that provides a general schema for characterizing semantics through the decomposition along strongly connected components (SCCs). While this property has been extensively explored in various qualitative frameworks, it has been relatively neglected in quantitative argumentation. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that this property is well-suited to fuzzy extension semantics, which is a quantitative generalization of classical semantics in fuzzy argumentation frameworks (FAF). We tailor the SCC-recursive schema to enable the characterization of fuzzy extension semantics through the recursive decomposition of an FAF along its SCCs. Our contributions are twofold. Theoretically, we show that SCC-recursiveness provides an alternative approach to characterize fuzzy extension semantics, offering a deep understanding and better insight into these semantics. Practically, our schema provides a sound and complete algorithm for computing fuzzy extension semantics, which naturally reduces computational efforts when dealing with a large number of SCCs.",2020-06-16T02:33:06Z,2024-10-28T13:27:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08880v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08880v2,"cs.AI, math.LO"

Wikipedia is a freely-available, peer-produced encyclopedia with a remarkable ability to create and revise content following current events. Using 973,940 revisions from 134,337 editors to 4,238 articles, this study examines the dynamics of the English Wikipedia's response to the coronavirus pandemic through the first five months of 2020 as a ""quantitative portrait"" describing the emergent collaborative behavior at three levels of analysis: article revision, editor contributions, and network dynamics. Across multiple data sources, quantitative methods, and levels of analysis, we find four consistent themes characterizing Wikipedia's unique large-scale, high-tempo, and temporary online collaborations: external events as drivers of activity, spillovers of activity, complex patterns of editor engagement, and the shadows of the future.

Sharp quantitative stability for isoperimetric inequalities with   homogeneous weights,"Eleonora Cinti, Federico Glaudo, Aldo Pratelli, Xavier Ros-Oton, Joaquim Serra","We prove the sharp quantitative stability for a wide class of weighted isoperimetric inequalities. More precisely, we consider isoperimetric inequalities in convex cones with homogeneous weights.   Inspired by the proof of such isoperimetric inequalities through the ABP method, we construct a new convex coupling (i.e., a map that is the gradient of a convex function) between a generic set $E$ and the minimizer of the inequality (as in Gromov's proof of the isoperimetric inequality). Even if this map does not come from optimal transport, and even if there is a weight in the inequality, we adapt the methods of Figalli-Maggi-Pratelli and prove that if $E$ is almost optimal for the inequality then it is quantitatively close to a minimizer up to translations. Then, a delicate analysis is necessary to rule out the possibility of translations.   As a step of our proof, we establish a sharp regularity result for restricted convex envelopes of a function that might be of independent interest.",2020-06-24T16:50:05Z,2020-06-24T16:50:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13867v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13867v1,"math.AP, math.OC, 49Q10 (Primary) 49Q20, 28A75, 49K40 (Secondary)"

The set of admissable perturbations includes the ones coming from spatial discretization and hence numerical truncation. We also show linear response for smooth perturbations that preserve the rotation number, as well as for more general ones.

Here, we build an Additional Defect Absorption Model that describes the irradiation-induced swelling effects produced by energetic electrons, heavy-ions, and neutrons by considering additional defect sinks inherent in the irradiation process. Based on this model, we establish quantitative methods to predict high-dose swelling from low-dose behavior and obtain the equivalent irradiation dose for different energetic particles when the dose rates differ by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we propose a universal parameter to characterize the swelling resistance of various alloys and predict their radiation tolerances under different radiation conditions.

Quantitative Resilience of Linear Systems,"Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Melkior Ornik","Actuator malfunctions may have disastrous consequences for systems not designed to mitigate them. We focus on the loss of control authority over actuators, where some actuators are uncontrolled but remain fully capable. To counteract the undesirable outputs of these malfunctioning actuators, we use real-time measurements and redundant actuators. In this setting, a system that can still reach its target is deemed resilient. To quantify the resilience of a system, we compare the shortest time for the undamaged system to reach the target with the worst-case shortest time for the malfunctioning system to reach the same target, i.e., when the malfunction makes that time the longest. Contrary to prior work on driftless linear systems, the absence of analytical expression for time-optimal controls of general linear systems prevents an exact calculation of quantitative resilience. Instead, relying on Lyapunov theory we derive analytical bounds on the nominal and malfunctioning reach times in order to bound quantitative resilience.

The optical measurements determine the scattering and absorption cross-section spectra in absolute units, and electron tomography determines the 3D morphology. Numerical simulations of the spectra for the individual particle geometry, and the specific optical setup used, allow for a quantitative comparison including the cross-section magnitude. Silver nanoparticles produced by photochemically driven colloidal synthesis, including decahedra, tetrahedra and bi-tetrahedra are investigated.

We propose the use of a new filtration function for persistent homology which takes as input the adjacent oscillator trajectories of a dynamical system. We also regulate the dynamical system by a weighted graph Laplacian matrix derived from the network of interest, which embeds the topological connectivity of the network into the dynamical system. The resulting topological signatures, which we call evolutionary homology (EH) barcodes, reveal the topology-function relationship of the network and thus give rise to the quantitative analysis of nodal properties.

A three-dimensional thin-shell model, in which the increased mechanical compliance is caused by flattening and eventual buckling of the filament cross-section, captures this softening effect in the high strain regime and yields quantitative values of the effective mechanical properties of microtubules.

For Markov chains on $\mathbb{R^d}$ with isotropic transition kernels, the general bounds can be used efficiently together with a coupling that combines maximal and reflection coupling.

Neural Stain Normalization and Unsupervised Classification of Cell   Nuclei in Histopathological Breast Cancer Images,"Edwin Yuan, Junkyo Suh","In this paper, we develop a complete pipeline for stain normalization, segmentation, and classification of nuclei in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained breast cancer histopathology images. In the first step, we use a CNN-based stain transfer technique to normalize the staining characteristics of (H&E) images. We then train a neural network to segment images of nuclei from the H&E images. Finally, we train an Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN) to learn visual representations of different types of nuclei and classify them in an entirely unsupervised manner. The results show that our proposed CNN stain normalization yields improved visual similarity and cell segmentation performance compared to the conventional SVD-based stain normalization method. In the final step of our pipeline, we demonstrate the ability to perform fully unsupervised clustering of various breast histopathology cell types based on morphological and color attributes. In addition, we quantitatively evaluate our neural network - based techniques against various quantitative metrics to validate the effectiveness of our pipeline.",2018-11-09T08:34:36Z,2018-11-09T08:34:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03815v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03815v1,"cs.CV, q-bio.QM"
Mid-price Prediction Based on Machine Learning Methods with Technical   and Quantitative Indicators,"Adamantios Ntakaris, Juho Kanniainen, Moncef Gabbouj, Alexandros Iosifidis","Stock price prediction is a challenging task, but machine learning methods have recently been used successfully for this purpose. In this paper, we extract over 270 hand-crafted features (factors) inspired by technical and quantitative analysis and tested their validity on short-term mid-price movement prediction. We focus on a wrapper feature selection method using entropy, least-mean squares, and linear discriminant analysis. We also build a new quantitative feature based on adaptive logistic regression for online learning, which is constantly selected first among the majority of the proposed feature selection methods. This study examines the best combination of features using high frequency limit order book data from Nasdaq Nordic.

For this method to be quantitative, it relies on an accurate method of the light fluence in the tissue. This is difficult deep in heterogeneous tissue, where different wavelengths of light can experience significantly different attenuation. In this work, we developed a new deep neural network to simultaneously estimate the oxygen saturation in blood vessels and segment the vessels from the surrounding background tissue. The network was trained on estimated initial pressure distributions from three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in breast tissue. The network estimated vascular SO2 in less than 50 ms with as little as 5.1% median error and better than 95% segmentation accuracy.

Onset of sliding of elastomer multicontacts: failure of a model of   independent asperities to match experiments,"Julien Scheibert, Riad Sahli, Michel Peyrard","Modelling of rough frictional interfaces is often based on asperity models, in which the individual behaviour of individual microjunctions is assumed. In the absence of local measurements at the microjunction scale, quantitative comparison of such models with experiments is usually based only on macroscopic quantities, like the total tangential load resisted by the interface. Recently however, a new experimental dataset was presented on the onset of sliding of rough elastomeric interfaces, which includes local measurements of the contact area of the individual microjunctions. Here, we use this more comprehensive dataset to test the possibility of quantitatively matching the measurements with a model of independent asperities, enriched with experimental information about the area of microjunctions and its evolution under shear. We show that, despite using parameter values and behaviour laws constrained and inspired by experiments, our model does not quantitatively match the macroscopic measurements. We discuss the possible origins of this failure .",2019-11-15T16:34:21Z,2020-05-06T15:23:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10909v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10909v2,"cond-mat.soft, physics.class-ph"

QAPL 2019 was a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2019).   QAPL focuses on quantitative aspects of computations, which may refer to the use of physical quantities (time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical quantities (e.g., probabilities) for the characterisation of the behaviour and for determining the properties of systems. Such quantities play a central role in defining both the model of systems (architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for the analysis and verification of system properties. The aim of the QAPL workshop series is to discuss the explicit use of time and probability and general quantities either directly in the model or as a tool for the analysis or synthesis of systems.   The 16th edition of QAPL also focuses on discussing the developments, challenges and results in this area covered by our workshop in its nearly 20-year history.",2020-01-17T05:38:50Z,2020-01-17T05:38:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06163v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06163v1,"cs.PL, cs.GT, cs.IT, cs.LO, math.IT"
Validation of secondary fluorescence excitation in quantitative X-ray   fluorescence analysis of thin alloy films,"André Wählisch, Cornelia Streeck, Philipp Hönicke, Burkhard Beckhoff","X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis is a widely applied technique for the quantitative analysis of thin films up to the $\mu$m scale because of its non-destructive nature and because it is easily automated. When low uncertainties of the analytical results in the few percent range are required, the non-linear secondary fluorescence effect in multi-elemental samples may complicate an otherwise straightforward quantification, since it can easily exceed a relative contribution of 20%. The conventional solution, to rely on good performing reference samples, is hindered by their low availability, especially for thin film applications. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a flexible production method of multilayered, alloyed thin films with significant secondary fluorescence contributions. We use reference-free XRF analysis to validate the reliability of the physical model for secondary fluorescence, which includes a thorough uncertainty estimation. The investigated specimens are being qualified as calibration samples for XRF or other quantitative analyses.",2020-03-19T17:52:24Z,2020-03-19T17:52:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08930v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08930v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.app-ph, physics.chem-ph"
Neural Network-based Automatic Factor Construction,"Jie Fang, Jianwu Lin, Shutao Xia, Yong Jiang, Zhikang Xia, Xiang Liu","Instead of conducting manual factor construction based on traditional and behavioural finance analysis, academic researchers and quantitative investment managers have leveraged Genetic Programming (GP) as an automatic feature construction tool in recent years, which builds reverse polish mathematical expressions from trading data into new factors. However, with the development of deep learning, more powerful feature extraction tools are available. This paper proposes Neural Network-based Automatic Factor Construction (NNAFC), a tailored neural network framework that can automatically construct diversified financial factors based on financial domain knowledge and a variety of neural network structures. The experiment results show that NNAFC can construct more informative and diversified factors than GP, to effectively enrich the current factor pool. For the current market, both fully connected and recurrent neural network structures are better at extracting information from financial time series than convolution neural network structures. Moreover, new factors constructed by NNAFC can always improve the return, Sharpe ratio, and the max draw-down of a multi-factor quantitative investment strategy due to their introducing more information and diversification to the existing factor pool.",2020-08-14T07:44:49Z,2020-10-13T16:20:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06225v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06225v3,"q-fin.ST, cs.LG"
What do we mean by the dimensionality of behavior?,William Bialek,"There is growing effort in the ""physics of behavior"" that aims at complete quantitative characterization of animal movements under more complex, naturalistic conditions. One reaction to the resulting explosion of data is the search for low dimensional structure. Here I try to define more clearly what we mean by the dimensionality of behavior, where observable behavior may consist either of continuous trajectories or sequences of discrete states. This discussion also serves to isolate situations in which the dimensionality of behavior is effectively infinite.

We obtain a quantitative weighted bound, which is consistent with the one obtained by Hyt\""onen--Roncal--Tapiola in the Euclidean setting, for this operator on $L^{p}(w)$. Comparing to the previous results in the Euclidean setting, our assumptions on the kernel and on the underlying space are weaker.

We show that on a manifold with uniformly positive scalar curvature, the propagation at which the index of the Dirac operator vanishes is related inversely to the curvature lower bound.

Exposure to standard operational stressors (light, temperature, bias, oxygen, and water) often instigate optical and electronic dynamics, calling for a systematic investigation into MHP photophysical processes and the development of quantitative models for their prediction. We resolve the moisture-driven light emission dynamics for both methylammonium lead tribromide and triiodide thin films as a function of relative humidity (rH). With the humidity and photoluminescence time series, we train recurrent neural networks and establish their ability to quantitatively predict the path of future light emission with <11% error over 12 hours.

Beating Temporal Phase Sensitivity Limit in Off-axis Interferometry   based Quantitative Phase Microscopy,"Yujie Nie, Renjie Zhou","Phase sensitivity determines the lowest optical path length (OPL) value that can be detected from the noise floor in a quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) system. The temporal phase sensitivity is known to be limited by both photon shot-noise and a variety of noise sources from electronic devices and environment. To beat temporal phase sensitivity limit, we explore different ways to reduce different noise factors in off-axis interferometry-based QPM using laser-illumination. Using a high electron-well-capacity camera, we measured the temporal phase sensitivity values using non-common-path and common-path interferometry based QPM systems under different environmental conditions. A frame summing method and a spatiotemporal filtering method are further used to reduce the noise contributions, thus enabling us to push the overall temporal phase sensitivity to less than 2 picometers.",2020-10-22T06:50:02Z,2020-10-22T06:50:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11477v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11477v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph, physics.optics"
Quantitative imaging for complex-objects via a single-pixel detector,"Xianye Li, Yafei sun, Yikang He, Xun Li, Baoqing Sun","Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is important in many applications such as microscopy and crystallography. To quantitatively reveal phase information, people could either employ interference to map phase distribution into intensity fringes, or analyze intensity-only diffraction patterns through phase retrieval algorithms. Traditionally, both of these two ways use pixelated detectors. In this work, a novel QPI scheme is reported inspired by single-pixel camera (SPC), which adopts the principle of SPC that retrieves images through structured illumination and corresponding single-pixel signals. Particularly for complex-valued imaging, the structured illumination is performed in the phase domain, and a point detector with restricted sensor size detects the intensity of zero-frequency area. Based on the illumination structures and point signals, a complex image is reconstructed by running a phase retrieval algorithm. This approach is universal for various wavelengths, and needs no a priori information of the targets. Both simulation and experiment show that our single-pixel QPI scheme exhibits great performance even with objects in an extremely rough phase distribution.",2020-11-10T15:33:24Z,2020-11-10T15:33:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05182v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05182v1,"physics.optics, eess.IV"

For the first time, we in-situ observed the unidirectional growth of lamellar sea ice with well-manipulated ice crystal orientation and visualized tip undercooling of sea ice. A semi-empirical model was proposed to quantitatively address the variation of tip undercooling with growth velocity and salinity and compared with a very recent analytical model. With the real-time observation, interesting phenomena of doublon tip in cellular ice growth and growth direction shift of ice dendritic tip were discovered for the first time, which are attributed to the complex solutal diffusion and anisotropic interface kinetics in sea ice growth.

Particle Dual Averaging: Optimization of Mean Field Neural Networks with   Global Convergence Rate Analysis,"Atsushi Nitanda, Denny Wu, Taiji Suzuki","We propose the particle dual averaging (PDA) method, which generalizes the dual averaging method in convex optimization to the optimization over probability distributions with quantitative runtime guarantee. The algorithm consists of an inner loop and outer loop: the inner loop utilizes the Langevin algorithm to approximately solve for a stationary distribution, which is then optimized in the outer loop. The method can thus be interpreted as an extension of the Langevin algorithm to naturally handle nonlinear functional on the probability space. An important application of the proposed method is the optimization of neural network in the mean field regime, which is theoretically attractive due to the presence of nonlinear feature learning, but quantitative convergence rate can be challenging to obtain. By adapting finite-dimensional convex optimization theory into the space of measures, we analyze PDA in regularized empirical / expected risk minimization, and establish quantitative global convergence in learning two-layer mean field neural networks under more general settings.

The proposed adaptive CEE method combines the predictive mean and standard deviation based on the additive Gaussian process to achieve a meaningful balance between exploitation and exploration for optimization. Moreover, the adaptiveness of the proposed sequential procedure allows the selection of next design point from the adaptive design region.

ADiag: Graph Neural Network Based Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,Vishnu Ram Sampathkumar,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most widespread neurodegenerative disease, affecting over 50 million people across the world.

Currently, only qualitative means of testing are employed in the form of scoring performance on a battery of cognitive tests. The inherent disadvantage of this method is that the burden of an accurate diagnosis falls on the clinician's competence. Quantitative methods like MRI scan assessment are inaccurate at best,due to the elusive nature of visually observable changes in the brain. In lieu of these disadvantages to extant methods of AD diagnosis, we have developed ADiag, a novel quantitative method to diagnose AD through GraphSAGE Network and Dense Differentiable Pooling (DDP) analysis of large graphs based on thickness difference between different structural regions of the cortex.

Our motivation is a problem in quantitative group testing. Given a set of $n$ elements two of which are defective, the quantitative group testing problem asks for the identification of these two defectives through a series of tests.

Quantitative phase imaging of single particles from a cryoEM micrograph,"Apoorv Pant, Manidipa Banerjee, Kedar Khare","We show that de-focused single particle images recorded using a cryo-electron microscope (cryoEM) system may be processed like a Fresnel zone in-line hologram to obtain physically meaningful quantitative phase maps associated with individual particles. In particular, a region-of-interest (ROI) of the de-focused image surrounding a particle can be numerically back-propagated, in order to determine accurate de-focus information based on the sparsity-of-gradient merit function. Further with the knowledge of de-focus information, an iterative Fresnel zone phase retrieval algorithm using image sparsity constraints can accurately estimate the quantitative phase information associated with a single particle. The proposed methodology which can correct for both de-focus and spherical aberrations is a deviation from the image processing chain currently used in single particle cryoEM reconstructions.

Here we build upon recent progress in reconstructing data-driven fitness landscapes for families of homologous proteins, to propose stochastic models of experimental protein evolution. These models predict quantitatively important features of experimentally evolved sequence libraries, like fitness distributions and position-specific mutational spectra. They also allow us to efficiently simulate sequence libraries for a vast array of combinations of experimental parameters like sequence divergence, selection strength and library size. We showcase the potential of the approach in re-analyzing two recent experiments to determine protein structure from signals of epistasis emerging in experimental sequence libraries. To be detectable, these signals require sufficiently large and sufficiently diverged libraries.

Compared to the original velocity model, the new model reduces the occurrence of gridlocks and reproduces the movement of pedestrians more realistically. For a quantitative description of the phenomenon, the definition of an order parameter is used to describe the formation of lanes at transient states and to show that the proposed model compares relatively well with experimental data. Furthermore, the model is validated by the experimental fundamental diagrams of bidirectional flows.",2021-07-01T17:24:16Z,2021-07-01T17:24:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00624v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00624v1,"physics.soc-ph, nlin.AO"
Quantitative Evaluation of Explainable Graph Neural Networks for   Molecular Property Prediction,"Jiahua Rao, Shuangjia Zheng, Yuedong Yang","Advances in machine learning have led to graph neural network-based methods for drug discovery, yielding promising results in molecular design, chemical synthesis planning, and molecular property prediction. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) remain of limited acceptance in drug discovery is limited due to their lack of interpretability. Although this major weakness has been mitigated by the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, the ""ground truth"" assignment in most explainable tasks ultimately rests with subjective judgments by humans so that the quality of model interpretation is hard to evaluate in quantity. In this work, we first build three levels of benchmark datasets to quantitatively assess the interpretability of the state-of-the-art GNN models. Then we implemented recent XAI methods in combination with different GNN algorithms to highlight the benefits, limitations, and future opportunities for drug discovery. As a result, GradInput and IG generally provide the best model interpretability for GNNs, especially when combined with GraphNet and CMPNN. The integrated and developed XAI package is fully open-sourced and can be used by practitioners to train new models on other drug discovery tasks.",2021-07-01T04:49:29Z,2021-07-12T04:12:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04119v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04119v2,"q-bio.QM, cs.LG"
The Traveling Salesman Theorem for Jordan Curves in Hilbert Space,Jared Krandel,"Given a metric space $X$, an Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem for $X$ gives a quantitative relationship between the length of a shortest curve containing any subset $E\subseteq X$ and a multi-scale sum measuring the ``flatness'' of $E$. The first such theorem was proven by Jones for $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ and extended to $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ by Okikiolu, while an analogous theorem was proven for Hilbert space, $X = H$, by Schul. Bishop has since shown that if one considers Jordan arcs, then the quantitative relationship given by Jones' and Okikioulu's results can be sharpened. This paper gives a full proof of Schul's original necessary half of the traveling salesman theorem in Hilbert space and provides a sharpening of the theorem's quantitative relationship when restricted to Jordan arcs analogous to Bishop's aforementioned sharpening in $\mathbb{R}^n$.",2021-07-14T21:47:59Z,2022-10-26T18:57:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07017v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07017v3,"math.CA, 28A75, 28A78, 28A12"

Many current deep learning approaches are not data consistent, require in vivo training data or solve the QSM problem in consecutive steps resulting in the propagation of errors. Here we aim to overcome these limitations and developed a framework to solve the QSM processing steps jointly. We developed a new hybrid training data generation method that enables the end-to-end training for solving background field correction and dipole inversion in a data-consistent fashion using a variational network that combines the QSM model term and a learned regularizer. We demonstrate that NeXtQSM overcomes the limitations of previous deep learning methods.

In order to be able to quantitatively compare the results of our SPH simulation method with grid based methods we additionally propose an improved particle to grid interpolation method based on linear least-squares with an optional hole-filling pass which accounts for missing particles.

ReLaX: Retinal Layer Attribution for Guided Explanations of Automated   Optical Coherence Tomography Classification,"Evan Wen, Rebecca Sorenson, Max Ehrlich","30 million Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging tests are issued annually to diagnose various retinal diseases, but accurate diagnosis of OCT scans requires trained eye care professionals who are still prone to making errors. With better systems for diagnosis, many cases of vision loss caused by retinal disease could be entirely avoided. In this work, we present ReLaX, a novel deep learning framework for explainable, accurate classification of retinal pathologies which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize producing both qualitative and quantitative explanations of the model's decisions. While previous works use pixel-level attribution methods for generating model explanations, our work uses a novel retinal layer attribution method for producing rich qualitative and quantitative model explanations. ReLaX determines the importance of each retinal layer by combining heatmaps with an OCT segmentation model. Our work is the first to produce detailed quantitative explanations of a model's predictions in this way.

Using specific OCTA imaging biomarkers for the identification of pathologies, automated image segmentations of the blood vessels can improve subsequent analysis and diagnosis. We present a novel segmentation method for vessel density identification based on frequency representations of the image, in particular, using so-called Gabor filter banks. The algorithm is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on an OCTA image in-house data set from $10$ eyes acquired by a Cirrus HD-OCT device. Qualitatively, the segmentation outcomes received very good visual evaluation feedback by experts. Quantitatively, we compared the resulting vessel density values with automated in-built values provided by the device. The results underline the visual evaluation. For the evaluation of the FAZ identification substep, manual annotations of $2$ expert graders were used, showing that our results coincide well in visual and quantitative manners.

We present an accurate and practically feasible real-time capable method for quantitative imaging of sO$_2$ based on combining multispectral (MS) and multiple illumination (MI) OA imaging with learned spectral decoloring (LSD). For this purpose we developed a hybrid real-time MI MS OA imaging setup with ultrasound (US) imaging capability; we trained gradient boosting machines on MI spectrally colored absorbed energy spectra generated by generic Monte Carlo simulations, and used the trained models to estimate sO$_2$ on real OA measurements. We validated MI-LSD in silico and on in vivo image sequences of radial arteries and accompanying veins of five healthy human volunteers.

As a result we obtain computationally fast methods for the optimization of robot movement laws to achieve a prescribed collective behavior.

Limits on the Evolutionary Rates of Biological Traits,Luis Pedro García-Pintos,"This paper focuses on the maximum speed at which biological evolution can occur. I derive inequalities that limit the rate of evolutionary processes driven by natural selection, mutations, or genetic drift. These \emph{rate limits} link the variability in a population to evolutionary rates. In particular, high variances in the fitness of a population and of a quantitative trait allow for fast changes in the trait's average. In contrast, low variability makes a trait less susceptible to random changes due to genetic drift. The results in this article generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to dynamics that allow for mutations and genetic drift, via trade-off relations that constrain the evolutionary rates of arbitrary traits. The rate limits can be used to probe questions in various evolutionary biology and ecology settings. They apply, for instance, to trait dynamics within or across species or to the evolution of bacteria strains. They apply to any quantitative trait, e.g., from species' weights to the lengths of DNA strands.",2022-02-15T16:05:37Z,2024-06-14T16:23:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07533v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07533v4,"q-bio.PE, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
On quantitative hypocoercivity estimates based on Harris-type theorems,Havva Yoldaş,"This review concerns recent results on the quantitative study of convergence towards the stationary state for spatially inhomogeneous kinetic equations. We focus on analytical results obtained by means of certain probabilistic techniques from the ergodic theory of Markov processes. These techniques are sometimes referred to as Harris-type theorems. They provide constructive proofs for convergence results in the $L^1$ (or total variation) setting for a large class of initial data. The convergence rates can be made explicit (both for geometric and sub-geometric rates) by tracking the constants appearing in the hypotheses. Harris-type theorems are particularly well-adapted for equations exhibiting non-explicit and non-equilibrium steady states since they do not require prior information on the existence of stationary states. This allows for significant improvements of some already-existing results by relaxing assumptions and providing explicit convergence rates. We aim to present Harris-type theorems, providing a guideline on how to apply these techniques to the kinetic equations at hand. We discuss recent quantitative results obtained for kinetic equations in gas theory and mathematical biology, giving some perspectives on potential extensions to nonlinear equations.",2022-02-28T21:13:08Z,2022-10-27T13:22:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00096v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00096v2,"math.AP, math.PR, 35B40, 35Q20, 35Q92, 37A25, 60J25"

One proposal that addresses this challenge from a statistical perspective is the use of quantitative decision-making (QDM) methods to support a data-driven, objective appraisal of the evidence that forms the basis of decisions at different development levels. Growing awareness among statistical leaders in the industry has led to the creation of the European EFSPI/PSI special interest group (ESIG) on quantitative decision making to share experiences, collect best practices, and promote the use of QDM. In this paper, we introduce key components of QDM and present examples of QDM methods on trial, program, and portfolio level. The ESIG created a questionnaire to learn how and to what extent QDM methods are currently used in the different development phases. We present the main questionnaire findings, and we show where QDM is already used today but also where areas for future improvement can be identified.

Recently, a new proof of the theorem was found, which made it possible to relax the dimensional constraint and more generally, to add on the congruence condition by M. Alam, A. Ghosh, and S. Yu.   In this paper, we generalize this new approach to S-arithmetic spaces and obtain a quantitative version of an S-arithmetic Khintchine-Groshev theorem. In fact, we consider a new S-arithmetic analog of Diophantine approximation, which is different from the one formerly established (see the 2007 paper of D. Kleinbock and G. Tomanov).

The spacetime singularities arise when area radius $r$ vanishes and they are spacelike. We derive new quantitative estimates, obtain polynomial blow-up rates $O(1/r^N)$ for various quantities, and extend the results in [5] by the first author and Zhang and the arguments in [3] by the first author and Gajic to the cosmological settings. In particular, we sharpen the estimates of $r\partial_u r$ and $r\partial_v r$ in [5] and prove that the spacelike singularities where $r(u,v)=0$ are $C^{1,1/3}$ in $(u,v)$ coordinates. As an application, these estimates also give quantitative blow-up upper bounds of fluid velocity and density for the hard-phase model of the Einstein-Euler system under irrotational assumption. Near the timelike infinity, we also generalize the theorems in [3] by linking the precise blow-up rates of the Kretschmann scalar to the exponential Price's law along the event horizon.

Quantifying this cellular status is being justified, we propose the term liberality for the quantitative value of cellular dedifferentiation and differentiation. In previous studies, we must convert the raw transcriptome data into quantitative transcriptome data through mapping, tag counting, assembling, and more bioinformatic processing to calculate the liberality. If we could remove this conversion step from estimating liberality, we could save computing resources and time and remove technical difficulties in using the computer. In this study, we propose a method of calculating cellular liberality without those transcriptome data conversion processes.

However, the usage of abstract methods to study inherently spatial data hinders the exploration and poses a considerable workload. sMolBoxes link quantitative analysis of a user-defined set of properties with interactive 3D visualizations. They enable visual explanations of molecular behaviors, which lead to an efficient discovery of biochemically significant parts of the MD simulation. sMolBoxes follow a node-based model for flexible definition, combination, and immediate evaluation of properties to be investigated. Progressive analytics enable fluid switching between multiple properties, which facilitates hypothesis generation. Each sMolBox provides quick insight to an observed property or function, available in more detail in the bigBox View.

This problem of estimating the susceptibility map is ill posed. Regularized recovery approaches exploiting signal properties such as smoothness and sparsity improve reconstructions, but suffer from over-smoothing artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential and generate maps with reduced artifacts. However, for reasonable reconstructions and network generalization, they require numerous training datasets resulting in increased data acquisition time. To overcome this issue, we proposed a subject-specific, patch-based, unsupervised learning algorithm to estimate the susceptibility map. We make the problem well-posed by exploiting the redundancies across the patches of the map using a deep convolutional neural network. We formulated the recovery of the susceptibility map as a regularized optimization problem and adopted an alternating minimization strategy to solve it.

We find that epsilon emerges as a capacity measure in both frameworks; via (log)-lift, a popular measure in information theory; and via max-case g-leakage, which we introduce to describe the leakage of any system to Bayesian adversaries modelled using ``worst-case'' assumptions under the QIF framework. Our characterisation resolves an important question of interpretability of epsilon and consolidates a number of disparate results covering the literature of both information theory and quantitative information flow.",2022-10-24T02:03:22Z,2023-05-18T07:22:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12916v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.12916v2,"cs.IT, cs.CR, math.IT"
Automatic Quantitative Analysis of Brain Organoids via Deep Learning,Jingli Shi,"Recent advances in brain organoid technology are exciting new ways, which have the potential to change the way how doctors and researchers understand and treat cerebral diseases. Despite the remarkable use of brain organoids derived from human stem cells in new drug testing, disease modeling, and scientific research, it is still heavily time-consuming work to observe and analyze the internal structure, cells, and neural inside the organoid by humans, specifically no standard quantitative analysis method combined growing AI technology for brain organoid. In this paper, an automated computer-assisted analysis method is proposed for brain organoid slice channels tagged with different fluorescent.

Classifying Mental-Disorders through Clinicians Subjective Approach   based on Three-way Decision,"Huidong Wang, Md Sakib Ullah Sourav, Mengdi Yang, Jiaping Zhang","In psychiatric diagnosis, a contemporary data-driven, manual-based method for mental disorders classification is the most popular technique; however, it has several inevitable flaws. Using the three-way decision as a framework, we propose a unified model that stands for clinicians' subjective approach (CSA) analysis consisting of three parts: quantitative analysis, quantitative analysis, and evaluation-based analysis. A ranking list and a set of numerical weights based on illness magnitude levels according to the clinician's greatest degree of assumptions are the findings of the qualitative and quantitative investigation. We further create a comparative classification of illnesses into three groups with varying important levels; a three-way evaluation-based model is utilized in this study for the aim of understanding and portraying these results in a more clear way. This proposed method might be integrated with the manual-based process as a complementary tool to improve precision while diagnosing mental disorders",2022-12-21T17:22:02Z,2023-04-07T18:38:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03351v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03351v4,"cs.AI, cs.IT, math.IT"
On computational properties of Cauchy problems generated by accretive   operators,"Pedro Pinto, Nicholas Pischke","In this paper, we provide quantitative versions of results on the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear semigroups generated by an accretive operator due to O. Nevanlinna and S. Reich as well as H.-K. Xu. These results themselves rely on a particular assumption on the underlying operator introduced by A. Pazy under the name of `convergence condition'. Based on logical techniques from `proof mining', a subdiscipline of mathematical logic, we derive various notions of a `convergence condition with modulus' which provide quantitative information on this condition in different ways. These techniques then also facilitate the extraction of quantitative information on the convergence results of Nevanlinna and Reich as well as Xu, in particular also in the form of rates of convergence which depend on these moduli for the convergence condition.",2023-01-17T13:37:17Z,2023-10-11T11:19:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06880v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06880v2,"math.AP, math.FA, 47H06, 35F25, 47H20, 03F10"

Using the centering condition and the invariant measures associated to the underlying diffusion process, we transform the equation into divergence form with modified diffusion coefficients but without drift. The latter is in the standard setting for which quantitative homogenization results have been developed systematically. An application of those results then yields quantitative estimates, such as the convergence rates and uniform Lipschitz regularity, for equations in non-divergence form with large drifts.",2023-02-02T15:23:54Z,2023-07-07T01:01:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01157v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01157v2,"math.AP, 35B27, 35J08"

Quantitative Error Analyses of Spectral Density Estimators Using   Covariance Lags,"Guangyu Wu, Anders Lindquist","Spectral density estimation is a core problem of system identification, which is an important research area of system control and signal processing. There have been numerous results on the design of spectral density estimators. However to our best knowledge, quantitative error analyses of the spectral density estimation have not been proposed yet. In real practice, there are two main factors which induce errors in the spectral density estimation, including the external additive noise and the limited number of samples. In this paper, which is a very preliminary version, we first consider a univariate spectral density estimator using covariance lags. The estimation task is performed by a convex optimization scheme, and the covariance lags of the estimated spectral density are exactly as desired, which makes it possible for quantitative error analyses such as to derive tight error upper bounds. We analyze the errors induced by the two factors and propose upper and lower bounds for the errors. Then the results of the univariate spectral estimator are generalized to the multivariate one.",2023-03-20T13:20:06Z,2023-03-20T13:20:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11084v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11084v1,"math.OC, cs.IT, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.IT"
Automatically Predict Material Properties with Microscopic Image Example   Polymer Compatibility,"Zhilong Liang, Zhenzhi Tan, Ruixin Hong, Wanli Ouyang, Jinying Yuan, Changshui Zhang","Many material properties are manifested in the morphological appearance and characterized with microscopic image, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Polymer miscibility is a key physical quantity of polymer material and commonly and intuitively judged by SEM images. However, human observation and judgement for the images is time-consuming, labor-intensive and hard to be quantified. Computer image recognition with machine learning method can make up the defects of artificial judging, giving accurate and quantitative judgement. We achieve automatic miscibility recognition utilizing convolution neural network and transfer learning method, and the model obtains up to 94% accuracy.

Enriching Disentanglement: From Logical Definitions to Quantitative   Metrics,"Yivan Zhang, Masashi Sugiyama","Disentangling the explanatory factors in complex data is a promising approach for generalizable and data-efficient representation learning. While a variety of quantitative metrics for learning and evaluating disentangled representations have been proposed, it remains unclear what properties these metrics truly quantify. In this work, we establish algebraic relationships between logical definitions and quantitative metrics to derive theoretically grounded disentanglement metrics. Concretely, we introduce a compositional approach for converting a higher-order predicate into a real-valued quantity by replacing (i) equality with a strict premetric, (ii) the Heyting algebra of binary truth values with a quantale of continuous values, and (iii) quantifiers with aggregators. The metrics induced by logical definitions have strong theoretical guarantees, and some of them are easily differentiable and can be used as learning objectives directly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics by isolating different aspects of disentangled representations.",2023-05-19T08:22:23Z,2024-10-31T12:10:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11512v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11512v3,"cs.LG, math.CT, math.LO"
Statistical causal inference methods for observational research in PER:   a primer,"Vidushi Adlakha, Eric Kuo","Recent critiques of Physics Education Research (PER) studies have revoiced the critical issues when drawing causal inferences from observational data where no intervention is present. In response to a call for a ""causal reasoning primer"", this paper discusses some of the fundamental issues underlying statistical causal inference. In reviewing these issues, we discuss well-established causal inference methods commonly applied in other fields and discuss their application to PER. Using simulated data sets, we illustrate (i) why analysis for causal inference should control for confounders but not control for mediators and colliders and (ii) that multiple proposed causal models can fit a highly correlated data set. Finally, we discuss how these causal inference methods can be used to represent and explain existing issues in quantitative PER. Throughout, we discuss a central issue: quantitative results from observational studies cannot support a researcher's proposed causal model over other alternative models. To address this issue, we propose an explicit role for observational studies in PER that draw statistical causal inferences: proposing future intervention studies and predicting their outcomes. Mirroring a broader connection between theoretical motivating experiments in physics, observational studies in PER can make quantitative predictions of the causal effects of interventions, and future intervention studies can test those predictions directly.",2023-05-23T22:33:44Z,2023-05-23T22:33:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14558v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14558v1,"stat.ME, physics.ed-ph"

It allows to examine the most influential material lines which are called Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) and order the material transport into dynamically distinct regions at large scales which resist diffusion or mixing. LCS reveal the robust skeleton of material surfaces and are essential to assess material transport in time-dependent flows quantitatively. Candidates of LCS can be estimated and visualised from finite-time stretching and folding fields by calculating the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE).

Probing the Quantitative-Qualitative Divide in Probabilistic Reasoning,"Duligur Ibeling, Thomas Icard, Krzysztof Mierzewski, Milan Mossé","This paper explores the space of (propositional) probabilistic logical languages, ranging from a purely `qualitative' comparative language to a highly `quantitative' language involving arbitrary polynomials over probability terms. While talk of qualitative vs. quantitative may be suggestive, we identify a robust and meaningful boundary in the space by distinguishing systems that encode (at most) additive reasoning from those that encode additive and multiplicative reasoning. The latter includes not only languages with explicit multiplication but also languages expressing notions of dependence and conditionality. We show that the distinction tracks a divide in computational complexity: additive systems remain complete for $\mathsf{NP}$, while multiplicative systems are robustly complete for $\exists\mathbb{R}$. We also address axiomatic questions, offering several new completeness results as well as a proof of non-finite-axiomatizability for comparative probability.

Such simulations provide insight into the governing deformation mechanisms and the interplay between different physical phenomena such as dislocation reactions or cross-slip. This work is focused on a detailed analysis of the influence of the cross-slip on the evolution of dislocation systems. A tailored data mining strategy using the ``\ab*{discrete-to-continuous} framework'' allows to quantify differences and to quantitatively compare dislocation structures. We analyze the quantitative effects of the cross-slip on the microstructure in the course of a tensile test and a subsequent relaxation to present the role of cross-slip in the microstructure evolution. The precision of the extracted quantitative information using D2C strongly depends on the resolution of the domain averaging.

Reframing the Brain Age Prediction Problem to a More Interpretable and   Quantitative Approach,"Neha Gianchandani, Mahsa Dibaji, Mariana Bento, Ethan MacDonald, Roberto Souza","Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in estimating brain age, which is an important brain health biomarker, from magnetic resonance (MR) images. However, most of these models only provide a global age prediction, and rely on techniques, such as saliency maps to interpret their results. These saliency maps highlight regions in the input image that were significant for the model's predictions, but they are hard to be interpreted, and saliency map values are not directly comparable across different samples. In this work, we reframe the age prediction problem from MR images to an image-to-image regression problem where we estimate the brain age for each brain voxel in MR images. We compare voxel-wise age prediction models against global age prediction models and their corresponding saliency maps. The results indicate that voxel-wise age prediction models are more interpretable, since they provide spatial information about the brain aging process, and they benefit from being quantitative.",2023-08-23T20:33:22Z,2023-08-23T20:33:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12416v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12416v1,"eess.IV, cs.AI, cs.CV, q-bio.QM"

Recently, counterfactual reasoning has gained increasing attention in medical research because of its ability to provide a refined visual explanatory map. However, such visual explanatory maps based on visual inspection alone are insufficient unless we intuitively demonstrate their medical or neuroscientific validity via quantitative features. In this study, we synthesize the counterfactual-labeled structural MRIs using our proposed framework and transform it into a gray matter density map to measure its volumetric changes over the parcellated region of interest (ROI). We also devised a lightweight linear classifier to boost the effectiveness of constructed ROIs, promoted quantitative interpretation, and achieved comparable predictive performance to DL methods.

Our estimate entails as a consequence quantitative self-improvement inequalities of Caccioppoli type for quasiregular distributions with dilatations in $W^{1,p}$, $p \geq 2$. Our proof strategy is then adapted to yield quantitative estimates for the resolvent $(I-\mu {\mathcal B}_\Omega)^{-1}$ of the Beltrami equation on a sufficiently regular domain $\Omega$, with $\mu\in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$. Here, ${\mathcal B}_\Omega$ is the compression of ${\mathcal B}$ to a domain $\Omega$. Our proofs do not rely on the compactness or commutator arguments previously employed in related literature.

However, this method still suffers from some limitations due to viscoelasticity, guiding geometry or static deformations.   Approach - To explore these limitations, a nearly-incompressible soft elastomer strip is chosen to mimic the mechanical behavior of an elongated tissue. A supersonic shear wave scanner measures the propagation of shear waves within the strip. By repeating the experiment on the same sample for different orientations and static strains, the scanner estimates the shear wave velocity in a wide range from 2 to 6 m/s.   Main results - The effect of waveguiding is highlighted and the spatio-temporal Fourier transform of the raw data provides dispersion diagrams. We provide a theoretical model that accounts for the static deformation and allows the extraction of the mechanical parameters of the sample, including its rheology and hyperelastic behavior.

We propose a hierarchical emotion distribution extractor, i.e. Hierarchical ED, that quantifies the intensity of emotions at different levels of granularity. Support vector machines (SVMs) are employed to rank emotion intensity, resulting in a hierarchical emotional embedding. Hierarchical ED is subsequently integrated into the FastSpeech2 framework, guiding the model to learn emotion intensity at phoneme, word, and utterance levels.

Bounded-Time Nonblocking Supervisory Control of Timed Discrete-Event   Systems,"Renyuan Zhang, Jiale Wu, Junhua Gou, Yabo Zhu, Kai Cai","Recently an automaton property of quantitative nonblockingness was proposed in supervisory control of untimed discrete-event systems (DES), which quantifies the standard nonblocking property by capturing the practical requirement that all tasks be completed within a bounded number of steps. However, in practice tasks may be further required to be completed in specific time. To meet this new requirement, in this paper we introduce the concept of bounded-time nonblockingness, which extends the concept of quantitative nonblockingness from untimed DES to timed DES. This property requires that each task must be completed within a bounded time counted by the number of ticks, rather than bounded number of transition steps in quantitative nonblockingness. Accordingly, we formulate a new bounded-time nonblocking supervisory control problem (BTNSCP) of timed DES, and characterize its solvability in terms of a new concept of bounded-time language completability. Then we present an approach to compute the maximally permissive solution to the new BTNSCP.",2024-01-28T00:54:06Z,2024-07-30T02:55:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08781v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08781v2,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
Quantitative homogenization and hydrodynamic limit of non-gradient   exclusion process,"Tadahisa Funaki, Chenlin Gu, Han Wang","For the non-gradient exclusion process, we prove the quantitative homogenization in the approximation of the diffusion matrix and the conductivity by local functions. The proof relies on the renormalization approach developed by Armstrong, Kuusi, Mourrat, and Smart, while the new challenge here is the hard core constraint of particle number on every site. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is proposed to lift the configuration to a larger space without exclusion, and a gradient coupling between two systems is applied to capture the spatial cancellation. We then strengthen the convergence rate to be uniform concerning the density and integrate it into the work by Funaki, Uchiyama, and Yau [IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 77 (1996), pp. 1-40.] to yield a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. Our new approach avoids showing the characterization of closed forms and provides stronger results.

Inverse Spectral Problems for Collapsing Manifolds II: Quantitative   Stability of Reconstruction for Orbifolds,"Matti Lassas, Jinpeng Lu, Takao Yamaguchi","We consider the inverse problem of determining the metric-measure structure of collapsing manifolds from local measurements of spectral data. In the part I of the paper, we proved the uniqueness of the inverse problem and a continuity result for the stability in the closure of Riemannian manifolds with bounded diameter and sectional curvature in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. In this paper we show that when the collapse of dimension is $1$-dimensional, it is possible to obtain quantitative stability of the inverse problem for Riemannian orbifolds. The proof is based on an improved version of the quantitative unique continuation for the wave operator on Riemannian manifolds by removing assumptions on the covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor.",2024-04-25T09:29:14Z,2024-04-25T09:29:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16448v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16448v1,"math.AP, math.DG, 35R30, 53B21, 58J50"
Quantitative uniform exponential acceleration of averages along decaying   waves,"Zhicheng Tong, Yong Li","In this study, utilizing a specific exponential weighting function, we investigate the uniform exponential convergence of weighted Birkhoff averages along decaying waves and delve into several related variants. A key distinction from traditional scenarios is evident here: despite reduced regularity in observables, our method still maintains exponential convergence. In particular, we develop new techniques that yield very precise rates of exponential convergence, as evidenced by numerical simulations. Furthermore, this innovative approach extends to quantitative analyses involving different weighting functions employed by others, surpassing the limitations inherent in prior research. It also enhances the exponential convergence rates of weighted Birkhoff averages along quasi-periodic orbits via analytic observables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the uniform exponential acceleration beyond averages along quasi-periodic or almost periodic orbits, particularly from a quantitative perspective.",2024-08-18T07:52:43Z,2024-09-17T08:01:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09398v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09398v2,"math.DS, 37A25, 37A30, 37A46"

Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods.

Quantitative Theory of Meaning. Application to Financial Markets.   EUR/USD case study,"Inga Ivanova, Grzegorz Rzadkowski, Loet Leydesdorff","The paper focuses on the link between information, investors' expectations and market price movement. EUR/USD market is examined from communication-theoretical perspective on the dynamics of information and meaning. We build upon the quantitative theory of meaning as a complement to the quantitative theory of information. Different groups of investors entertain different criteria to process information, so that the same information can be supplied with different meanings. Meanings shape investors' expectations which are revealed in market asset price movement. This dynamics can be captured by non-linear evolutionary equation. We use a computationally efficient technique of logistic Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT) to analyze EUR/USD market. The results reveal the latent EUR/USD trend structure which coincides with the model predicted time series indicating that proposed model can adequately describe some patterns of investors' behavior.

Quantitative Monoidal Algebra: Axiomatising Distance with String   Diagrams,"Gabriele Lobbia, Wojciech Różowski, Ralph Sarkis, Fabio Zanasi","String diagrammatic calculi have become increasingly popular in fields such as quantum theory, circuit theory, probabilistic programming, and machine learning, where they enable resource-sensitive and compositional algebraic analysis. Traditionally, the equations of diagrammatic calculi only axiomatise exact semantic equality. However, reasoning in these domains often involves approximations rather than strict equivalences. In this work, we develop a quantitative framework for diagrammatic calculi, where one may axiomatise notions of distance between string diagrams. Unlike similar approaches, such as the quantitative theories introduced by Mardare et al., this requires us to work in a monoidal rather than a cartesian setting. We define a suitable notion of monoidal theory, the syntactic category it freely generates, and its models, where the concept of distance is established via enrichment over a quantale.

Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet   propaganda,"M. V. Tamm, M. Oiva, K. D. Mukhina, M. Mets, M. Schich","Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.",2024-10-21T12:07:10Z,2024-10-21T12:07:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15938v1,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, econ.EM"
Strict inequalities for arm exponents in planar percolation,"Ritvik Ramanan Radhakrishnan, Vincent Tassion","We discuss a general method to prove quantitative improvements on correlation inequalities and apply it to arm estimates for Bernoulli bond percolation on the square lattice.

This answers a question of Garban and Steif, which was motivated by the study of exceptional times in dynamical percolation.

Quantitative bounds for bounded solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations   in endpoint critical Besov spaces,"Ruilin Hu, Phuoc-Tai Nguyen, Quoc-Hung Nguyen, Ping Zhang","In this paper, we study the quantitative regularity and blowup criteria for classical solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a critical Besov space framework. Specifically, we consider solutions $u\in L^\infty_t(\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}})$ such that $|D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u|\in L^\infty_t (L^p)$ with $3<p<\infty$. By deriving refined regularity estimates and substantially improving the strategy in \cite{Tao_20}, we overcome difficulties stemming from the low regularity of the Besov spaces and establish quantitative bounds for such solutions. These bounds are expressed in terms of a triple exponential of $\| u (t)\|_{\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}}$ combined with a single exponential of $\bigl\| |D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u(t)| \bigr\|_{L^p}$. Consequently, we obtain a new blowup rate which can be interpreted as a coupling of triple logarithm of $\| u(t) \|_{\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}}$ and a single logarithm of $\bigl\| |D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u(t)| \bigr\|_{L^p}$.",2024-11-10T14:45:00Z,2025-02-25T03:23:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06483v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06483v3,"math.AP, 35Q30, 37N10, 76D05"

The Promise and Peril of Generative AI: Evidence from GPT-4 as Sell-Side   Analysts,"Edward Li, Zhiyuan Tu, Dexin Zhou","We investigate how advanced large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, process corporate disclosures to forecast earnings. Using earnings press releases issued around GPT-4's knowledge cutoff date, we address two questions: (1) Do GPT-generated earnings forecasts outperform analysts in accuracy? (2) How is GPT's performance related to its processing of textual and quantitative information? Our findings suggest that GPT forecasts are significantly less accurate than those of analysts. This underperformance can be traced to GPT's distinct textual and quantitative approaches: its textual processing follows a consistent, generalized pattern across firms, highlighting its strengths in language tasks. In contrast, its quantitative processing capabilities vary significantly across firms, revealing limitations tied to the uneven availability of domain-specific training data. Additionally, there is some evidence that GPT's forecast accuracy diminishes beyond its knowledge cutoff, underscoring the need to evaluate LLMs under hindsight-free conditions.

Quantitative Predictive Monitoring and Control for Safe Human-Machine   Interaction,"Shuyang Dong, Meiyi Ma, Josephine Lamp, Sebastian Elbaum, Matthew B.

However, unsafe human-machine interaction can lead to catastrophic failures. We propose a novel approach that predicts future states by accounting for the uncertainty of human interaction, monitors whether predictions satisfy or violate safety requirements, and adapts control actions based on the predictive monitoring results. Specifically, we develop a new quantitative predictive monitor based on Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty (STL-U) to compute a robustness degree interval, which indicates the extent to which a sequence of uncertain predictions satisfies or violates an STL-U requirement. We also develop a new loss function to guide the uncertainty calibration of Bayesian deep learning and a new adaptive control method, both of which leverage STL-U quantitative predictive monitoring results. We apply the proposed approach to two case studies: Type 1 Diabetes management and semi-autonomous driving.

Sharp Quantitative Stability for the Prékopa-Leindler and   Borell-Brascamp-Lieb Inequalities,"Alessio Figalli, Peter van Hintum, Marius Tiba","The Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality is a classical extension of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality, which in turn is a functional counterpart of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. The stability of these inequalities has received significant attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress in the geometric setting, a sharp quantitative stability result for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality has remained elusive, even in the special case of log-concave functions. In this work, we provide a unified and definitive stability framework for these foundational inequalities. By establishing the optimal quantitative stability for the Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality in full generality, we resolve the conjectured sharp stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality as a particular case.

This paper endeavors to decompose the acceptance criterion into quantitative perception requirements, aiming to furnish developers with requirements that are not only understandable but also actionable. This paper introduces a risk decomposition methodology to derive SOTIF requirements for perception. More explicitly, for subsystemlevel safety requirements, we define a collision severity model to establish requirements for state uncertainty and present a Bayesian model to discern requirements for existence uncertainty.   For component-level safety requirements, we proposed a decomposition method based on the Shapley value.

Loss Functions for Inventory Control,Steven R.

These loss functions are important functions in inventory optimization and other quantitative fields. For several reasons, which will become apparent throughout this paper, the implementation of these loss functions prefers the use of an analytic expression, only using standard probability functions. However, complete and consistent references of analytic expressions for these loss functions are lacking in literature. This paper aims to close this gap and can serve as a reference for researchers, software engineers and practitioners that are concerned with the optimization of a quantitative system. This should lead directly to easily using different probability distributions in quantitive models which is at the core of optimization.

Beyond Words: How Large Language Models Perform in Quantitative   Management Problem-Solving,Jonathan Kuzmanko,"This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform when tackling quantitative management decision problems in a zero-shot setting. Drawing on 900 responses generated by five leading models across 20 diverse managerial scenarios, our analysis explores whether these base models can deliver accurate numerical decisions under varying presentation formats, scenario complexities, and repeated attempts. Contrary to prior findings, we observed no significant effects of text presentation format (direct, narrative, or tabular) or text length on accuracy. However, scenario complexity -- particularly in terms of constraints and irrelevant parameters -- strongly influenced performance, often degrading accuracy. Surprisingly, the models handled tasks requiring multiple solution steps more effectively than expected. Notably, only 28.8\% of responses were exactly correct, highlighting limitations in precision. We further found no significant ``learning effect'' across iterations: performance remained stable across repeated queries. Nonetheless, significant variations emerged among the five tested LLMs, with some showing superior binary accuracy. Overall, these findings underscore both the promise and the pitfalls of harnessing LLMs for complex quantitative decision-making, informing managers and researchers about optimal deployment strategies.",2025-02-23T12:39:39Z,2025-02-23T12:39:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16556v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16556v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.AP"
Optimization of MR Fingerprinting for Free-Breathing Quantitative   Abdominal Imaging,"Max H. C. van Riel, Zidan Yu, Shota Hodono, Ding Xia, Hersh Chandarana, Koji Fujimoto, Martijn A.

A three-dimensional MR fingerprinting sequence with a radial stack-of-stars trajectory was implemented for quantitative abdominal imaging. The k-space acquisition ordering was adjusted to improve motion-robustness. The flip angle pattern was optimized using the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound, and the encoding efficiency of sequences with 300, 600, 900, and 1800 flip angles was evaluated. To validate the sequence, a movable multicompartment phantom was developed. Reference multiparametric maps were acquired under stationary conditions using a previously validated MRF method. Periodic motion of the phantom was used to investigate the motion-robustness of the proposed sequence. The best performing sequence length (600 flip angles) was used to image the abdomen during a free-breathing volunteer scan. When using a series of 600 or more flip angles, the estimated $T_1$ values in the stationary phantom showed good agreement with the reference scan. Phantom experiments revealed that motion-related artefacts can appear in the quantitative maps, and confirmed that a motion-robust k-space ordering is essential in preventing these artefacts. The in vivo scan demonstrated that the proposed sequence can produce clean parameter maps while the subject breathes freely. Using this sequence, it is possible to generate $B_1^+$-robust quantitative maps of proton density, $T_1$, and $B_1^+$ under free-breathing conditions at a clinically usable resolution within 5 minutes.",2020-06-04T15:16:42Z,2020-06-04T15:16:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02928v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02928v1,"physics.med-ph, eess.IV"

We propose Blip Up-Down Acquisition for Spin And Gradient Echo imaging (BUDA-SAGE), an efficient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence for quantitative mapping. The acquisition includes multiple T2*-, T2'- and T2-weighted contrasts. We alternate the phase-encoding polarities across the interleaved shots in this multi-shot navigator-free acquisition. A field map estimated from interim reconstructions was incorporated into the joint multi-shot EPI reconstruction with a structured low rank constraint to eliminate geometric distortion. A self-supervised MR-Self2Self (MR-S2S) neural network (NN) was utilized to perform denoising after BUDA reconstruction to boost SNR. Employing Slider encoding allowed us to reach 1 mm isotropic resolution by performing super-resolution reconstruction on BUDA-SAGE volumes acquired with 2 mm slice thickness. Quantitative T2 and T2* maps were obtained using Bloch dictionary matching on the reconstructed echoes. QSM was estimated using nonlinear dipole inversion (NDI) on the gradient echoes.

The best of both worlds: Combining population genetic and quantitative   genetic models,"Léonard Dekens, Sarah P. Otto, Vincent Calvez","Numerous traits under migration-selection balance are shown to exhibit complex patterns of genetic architecture with large variance in effect sizes. However, the conditions under which such genetic architectures are stable have yet to be investigated, because studying the influence of a large number of small allelic effects on the maintenance of spatial polymorphism is mathematically challenging, due to the high complexity of the systems that arise. In particular, in the most simple case of a haploid population in a two-patch environment, while it is known from population genetics that polymorphism at a single major-effect locus is stable in the symmetric case, there exists no analytical predictions on how this polymorphism holds when a polygenic background also contributes to the trait. Here we propose to answer this question by introducing a new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take into account the combined contributions of a major-effect locus and of a quantitative background resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is encoded according to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of small variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits are concentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal distribution, using new convex analysis arguments. This allows a reduction in the complexity of the system using a separation of time scales approach. We predict an undocumented phenomenon of loss of polymorphism at the major-effect locus despite strong selection for local adaptation, because the quantitative background slowly disrupts the rapidly established polymorphism at the major-effect locus, which is confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our study highlights how segregation of a quantitative background can greatly impact the dynamics of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns.",2021-11-22T12:06:56Z,2022-10-31T14:34:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11142v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11142v2,"q-bio.PE, math.AP, 92D15, 35Q92, 35R09, 34E13"
Can we infer microscopic financial information from the long memory in   market-order flow?: a quantitative test of the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model,"Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa","In financial markets, the market order sign exhibits strong persistence, widely known as the long-range correlation (LRC) of order flow; specifically, the sign correlation function displays long memory with power-law exponent $\gamma$, such that $C(\tau) \propto \tau^{-\gamma}$ for large time-lag $\tau$. One of the most promising microscopic hypotheses is the order-splitting behaviour at the level of individual traders. Indeed, Lillo, Mike, and Farmer (LMF) introduced in 2005 a simple microscopic model of order-splitting behaviour, which predicts that the macroscopic sign correlation is quantitatively associated with the microscopic distribution of metaorders. While this hypothesis has been a central issue of debate in econophysics, its direct quantitative validation has been missing because it requires large microscopic datasets with high resolution to observe the order-splitting behaviour of all individual traders. Here we present the first quantitative validation of this LFM prediction by analysing a large microscopic dataset in the Tokyo Stock Exchange market for more than nine years. On classifying all traders as either order-splitting traders or random traders as a statistical clustering, we directly measured the metaorder-length distributions $P(L)\propto L^{-\alpha-1}$ as the microscopic parameter of the LMF model and examined the theoretical prediction on the macroscopic order correlation: $\gamma \approx \alpha - 1$.

An Uncertainty Aided Framework for Learning based Liver $T_1ρ$   Mapping and Analysis,"Chaoxing Huang, Vincent Wai Sun Wong, Queenie Chan, Winnie Chiu Wing Chu, Weitian Chen","Objective: Quantitative $T_1\rho$ imaging has potential for assessment of biochemical alterations of liver pathologies. Deep learning methods have been employed to accelerate quantitative $T_1\rho$ imaging. To employ artificial intelligence-based quantitative imaging methods in complicated clinical environment, it is valuable to estimate the uncertainty of the predicated $T_1\rho$ values to provide the confidence level of the quantification results. The uncertainty should also be utilized to aid the post-hoc quantitative analysis and model learning tasks. Approach: To address this need, we propose a parametric map refinement approach for learning-based $T_1\rho$ mapping and train the model in a probabilistic way to model the uncertainty. We also propose to utilize the uncertainty map to spatially weight the training of an improved $T_1\rho$ mapping network to further improve the mapping performance and to remove pixels with unreliable $T_1\rho$ values in the region of interest. The framework was tested on a dataset of 51 patients with different liver fibrosis stages. Main results: Our results indicate that the learning-based map refinement method leads to a relative mapping error of less than 3% and provides uncertainty estimation simultaneously. The estimated uncertainty reflects the actual error level, and it can be used to further reduce relative $T_1\rho$ mapping error to 2.60% as well as removing unreliable pixels in the region of interest effectively. Significance: Our studies demonstrate the proposed approach has potential to provide a learning-based quantitative MRI system for trustworthy $T_1\rho$ mapping of the liver.",2023-07-06T02:44:32Z,2023-10-10T03:17:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02736v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02736v3,"physics.med-ph, cs.CV"
Quantitative statistical analysis of order-splitting behaviour of   individual trading accounts in the Japanese stock market over nine years,"Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa","In this research, we focus on the order-splitting behavior. The order splitting is a trading strategy to execute their large potential metaorder into small pieces to reduce transaction cost. This strategic behavior is believed to be important because it is a promising candidate for the microscopic origin of the long-range correlation (LRC) in the persistent order flow. Indeed, in 2005, Lillo, Mike, and Farmer (LMF) introduced a microscopic model of the order-splitting traders to predict the asymptotic behavior of the LRC from the microscopic dynamics, even quantitatively. The plausibility of this scenario has been qualitatively investigated by Toth et al. 2015. However, no solid support has been presented yet on the quantitative prediction by the LMF model in the lack of large microscopic datasets. In this report, we have provided the first quantitative statistical analysis of the order-splitting behavior at the level of each trading account. We analyse a large dataset of the Tokyo stock exchange (TSE) market over nine years, including the account data of traders (called virtual servers). The virtual server is a unit of trading accounts in the TSE market, and we can effectively define the trader IDs by an appropriate preprocessing. We apply a strategy clustering to individual traders to identify the order-splitting traders and the random traders. For most of the stocks, we find that the metaorder length distribution obeys power laws with exponent $\alpha$, such that $P(L)\propto L^{-\alpha-1}$ with the metaorder length $L$. By analysing the sign correlation $C(\tau)\propto \tau^{-\gamma}$, we directly confirmed the LMF prediction $\gamma \approx \alpha-1$. Furthermore, we discuss how to estimate the total number of the splitting traders only from public data via the ACF prefactor formula in the LMF model. Our work provides the first quantitative evidence of the LMF model.",2023-08-02T12:46:11Z,2023-08-02T12:46:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01112v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01112v1,"q-fin.TR, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-fin.CP, q-fin.GN, q-fin.RM"
Functions of Direct and Indirect Pathways for Action Selection Are   Quantitatively Analyzed in A Spiking Neural Network of The Basal Ganglia,"Sang-Yoon Kim, Woochang Lim","We are concerned about action selection in the basal ganglia (BG). We quantitatively analyze functions of direct pathway (DP) and indirect pathway (IP) for action selection in a spiking neural network with 3 competing channels. For such quantitative analysis, in each channel, we obtain the competition degree ${\cal C}_d$, given by the ratio of strength of DP (${\cal S}_{DP}$) to strength of IP (${\cal S}_{IP}$) (i.e., ${\cal C}_d = {\cal S}_{DP} / {\cal S}_{IP}$). Then, a desired action is selected in the channel with the largest ${\cal C}_d$. Desired action selection is made mainly due to strong focused inhibitory projection to the output nucleus, SNr (substantia nigra pars reticulata) via the DP in the corresponding channel. Unlike the case of DP, there are two types of IPs; intra-channel IP and inter-channel IP, due to widespread diffusive excitation from the STN (subthalamic nucleus). The intra-channel IP serves a function of brake to suppress the desired action selection. In contrast, the inter-channel IP to the SNr in the neighboring channels suppresses competing actions, leading to highlight the desired action selection. In this way, function of the inter-channel IP is opposite to that of the intra-channel IP. However, to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis for such functions of the DP and the two IPs was made. Here, through direct calculations of the DP and the intra- and the inter-channel IP presynaptic currents into the SNr in each channel, we obtain the competition degree of each channel to determine a desired action, and then functions of the DP and the intra- and inter-channel IPs are quantitatively made clear.",2024-04-22T05:31:40Z,2024-07-03T07:10:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13888v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13888v2,"q-bio.NC, physics.bio-ph"
An End-to-End AI-Based Framework for Automated Discovery of CEST/MT MR   Fingerprinting Acquisition Protocols and Quantitative Deep Reconstruction   (AutoCEST),"Or Perlman, Bo Zhu, Moritz Zaiss, Matthew S. Rosen, Christian T. Farrar","Purpose: To develop an automated machine-learning-based method for the discovery of rapid and quantitative chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MR fingerprinting acquisition and reconstruction protocols.   Methods: An MR physics governed AI system was trained to generate optimized acquisition schedules and the corresponding quantitative reconstruction neural-network. The system (termed AutoCEST) is composed of a CEST saturation block, a spin dynamics module, and a deep reconstruction network, all differentiable and jointly connected. The method was validated using a variety of chemical exchange phantoms and an in-vivo mouse brain at 9.4T.   Results: The acquisition times for AutoCEST optimized schedules ranged from 35-71s, with a quantitative image reconstruction time of only 29 ms. The resulting exchangeable proton concentration maps for the phantoms were in good agreement with the known solute concentrations for AutoCEST sequences (mean absolute error = 2.42 mM; Pearson's r=0.992 , p$<$0.0001), but not for an unoptimized sequence (mean absolute error = 65.19 mM; Pearson's r=-0.161, p=0.522). Similarly, improved exchange rate agreement was observed between AutoCEST and quantification of exchange using saturation power (QUESP) methods (mean absolute error: 35.8 Hz, Pearson's r=0.971, p$<$0.0001) compared to an unoptimized schedule and QUESP (mean absolute error = 58.2 Hz; Pearson's r=0.959, p$<$0.0001). The AutoCEST in-vivo mouse brain semi-solid proton volume-fractions were lower in the cortex (12.21$\pm$1.37%) compared to the white-matter (19.73 $\pm$ 3.30%), as expected, and the amide proton volume-fraction and exchange rates agreed with previous reports.   Conclusion: AutoCEST can automatically generate optimized CEST/MT acquisition protocols that can be rapidly reconstructed into quantitative exchange parameter maps.",2021-07-10T02:51:32Z,2021-07-10T02:51:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04737v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04737v1,"physics.med-ph, q-bio.QM"
Accelerated and Quantitative 3D Semisolid MT/CEST Imaging using a   Generative Adversarial Network (GAN-CEST),"Jonah Weigand-Whittier, Maria Sedykh, Kai Herz, Jaume Coll-Font, Anna N. Foster, Elizabeth R. Gerstner, Christopher Nguyen, Moritz Zaiss, Christian T. Farrar, Or Perlman","Purpose: To substantially shorten the acquisition time required for quantitative 3D chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) imaging and allow for rapid chemical exchange parameter map reconstruction. Methods: Three-dimensional CEST and MT magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) datasets of L-arginine phantoms, whole-brains, and calf muscles from healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and cardiac patients were acquired using 3T clinical scanners at 3 different sites, using 3 different scanner models and coils. A generative adversarial network supervised framework (GAN-CEST) was then designed and trained to learn the mapping from a reduced input data space to the quantitative exchange parameter space, while preserving perceptual and quantitative content. Results: The GAN-CEST 3D acquisition time was 42-52 seconds, 70% shorter than CEST-MRF. The quantitative reconstruction of the entire brain took 0.8 seconds. An excellent agreement was observed between the ground truth and GAN-based L-arginine concentration and pH values (Pearson's r > 0.97, NRMSE < 1.5%). GAN-CEST images from a brain-tumor subject yielded a semi-solid volume fraction and exchange rate NRMSE of 3.8$\pm$1.3% and 4.6$\pm$1.3%, respectively, and SSIM of 96.3$\pm$1.6% and 95.0$\pm$2.4%, respectively. The mapping of the calf-muscle exchange parameters in a cardiac patient, yielded NRMSE < 7% and SSIM > 94% for the semi-solid exchange parameters. In regions with large susceptibility artifacts, GAN-CEST has demonstrated improved performance and reduced noise compared to MRF. Conclusion: GAN-CEST can substantially reduce the acquisition time for quantitative semisolid MT/CEST mapping, while retaining performance even when facing pathologies and scanner models that were not available during training.",2022-07-22T18:52:27Z,2023-08-05T12:34:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11297v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11297v2,"physics.med-ph, cs.LG"
"Funnels, Pathways and the Energy Landscape of Protein Folding: A   Synthesis","J. D. Bryngelson, J. N. Onuchic, N. D. Socci, P. G. Wolynes","The understanding, and even the description of protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uni-exponential {\em vs.} multi-exponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions.",1994-11-11T11:22:12Z,1994-11-11T11:22:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/chem-ph/9411008v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/chem-ph/9411008v1,"chem-ph, cond-mat, physics.chem-ph"
Defining and identifying communities in networks,"Filippo Radicchi, Claudio Castellano, Federico Cecconi, Vittorio Loreto, Domenico Parisi","The investigation of community structures in networks is an important issue in many domains and disciplines. This problem is relevant for social tasks (objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological inquiries (functional studies in metabolic, cellular or protein networks) or technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types of algorithm exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a general and quantitative definition of community is still lacking, leading to an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results of the algorithms without any additional non-topological information. In this paper we face this problem by introducing two quantitative definitions of community and by showing how they are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a new local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to the computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The new algorithm is tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular we show the application of the new algorithm to a network of scientific collaborations, which, for its size, can not be attacked with the usual methods.

A quantitative ergodic theory proof of Szemerédi's theorem,Terence Tao,"A famous theorem of Szemer\'edi asserts that given any density $0 < \delta \leq 1$ and any integer $k \geq 3$, any set of integers with density $\delta$ will contain infinitely many proper arithmetic progressions of length $k$. For general $k$ there are essentially four known proofs of this fact; Szemer\'edi's original combinatorial proof using the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma and van der Waerden's theorem, Furstenberg's proof using ergodic theory, Gowers' proof using Fourier analysis and the inverse theory of additive combinatorics, and Gowers' more recent proof using a hypergraph regularity lemma. Of these four, the ergodic theory proof is arguably the shortest, but also the least elementary, requiring in particular the use of transfinite induction (and thus the axiom of choice), decomposing a general ergodic system as the weakly mixing extension of a transfinite tower of compact extensions. Here we present a quantitative, self-contained version of this ergodic theory proof, and which is ``elementary'' in the sense that it does not require the axiom of choice, the use of infinite sets or measures, or the use of the Fourier transform or inverse theorems from additive combinatorics. It also gives explicit (but extremely poor) quantitative bounds.",2004-05-13T12:31:09Z,2004-05-23T14:18:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0405251v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0405251v2,"math.CO, math.DS, 11B25, 37A45"
Validation of internal rating systems and PD estimates,Dirk Tasche,"This paper elaborates on the validation requirements for rating systems and probabilities of default (PDs) which were introduced with the New Capital Standards (Basel II). We start in Section 2 with some introductory remarks on the topics and approaches that will be discussed later on. Then we have a view on the developments in banking regulation that have enforced the interest of the public in validation techniques. When doing so, we put the main emphasis on the issues with quantitative validation. The techniques discussed here could be used in order to meet the quantitative regulatory requirements. However, their appropriateness will depend on the specific conditions under which they are applied. In order to have a common ground for the description of the different techniques, we introduce in Section 3 a theoretical framework that will be the basis for the further considerations. Intuitively, a good rating system should show higher probabilities of default for the less creditworthy rating grades. Therefore, in Section 4, we discuss how this monotonicity property is reflected in the theoretical framework from Section 3. In Section 5, we study the meaning of discriminatory power and some tools for measuring it in some detail. We will see that there are tools that might be more appropriate than others for the purpose of regulatory validation of discriminatory power. The topic in Section 6 is calibration of rating systems. We introduce some of the tests that can be used for checking correct calibration and discuss the properties of the different tests. We then conclude in Section 7 with some comments on the question which tools might be most appropriate for quantitative validation of rating systems and probabilities of default.",2006-06-07T20:12:07Z,2006-06-07T20:12:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606071v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0606071v1,"physics.soc-ph, q-fin.RM"
Decisive Markov Chains,"Parosh Aziz Abdulla, Noomene Ben Henda, Richard Mayr","We consider qualitative and quantitative verification problems for infinite-state Markov chains. We call a Markov chain decisive w.r.t. a given set of target states F if it almost certainly eventually reaches either F or a state from which F can no longer be reached. While all finite Markov chains are trivially decisive (for every set F), this also holds for many classes of infinite Markov chains. Infinite Markov chains which contain a finite attractor are decisive w.r.t. every set F. In particular, this holds for probabilistic lossy channel systems (PLCS). Furthermore, all globally coarse Markov chains are decisive. This class includes probabilistic vector addition systems (PVASS) and probabilistic noisy Turing machines (PNTM). We consider both safety and liveness problems for decisive Markov chains, i.e., the probabilities that a given set of states F is eventually reached or reached infinitely often, respectively. 1. We express the qualitative problems in abstract terms for decisive Markov chains, and show an almost complete picture of its decidability for PLCS, PVASS and PNTM. 2. We also show that the path enumeration algorithm of Iyer and Narasimha terminates for decisive Markov chains and can thus be used to solve the approximate quantitative safety problem. A modified variant of this algorithm solves the approximate quantitative liveness problem. 3. Finally, we show that the exact probability of (repeatedly) reaching F cannot be effectively expressed (in a uniform way) in Tarski-algebra for either PLCS, PVASS or (P)NTM.",2007-06-18T11:50:16Z,2007-11-08T20:21:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2585v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.2585v2,"cs.LO, cs.DM, G.3; D.2.4; F.4.1"
Game Refinement Relations and Metrics,"Luca de Alfaro, Rupak Majumdar, Vishwanath Raman, Mariëlle Stoelinga","We consider two-player games played over finite state spaces for an infinite number of rounds. At each state, the players simultaneously choose moves; the moves determine a successor state. It is often advantageous for players to choose probability distributions over moves, rather than single moves. Given a goal, for example, reach a target state, the question of winning is thus a probabilistic one: what is the maximal probability of winning from a given state?   On these game structures, two fundamental notions are those of equivalences and metrics. Given a set of winning conditions, two states are equivalent if the players can win the same games with the same probability from both states. Metrics provide a bound on the difference in the probabilities of winning across states, capturing a quantitative notion of state similarity.   We introduce equivalences and metrics for two-player game structures, and we show that they characterize the difference in probability of winning games whose goals are expressed in the quantitative mu-calculus. The quantitative mu-calculus can express a large set of goals, including reachability, safety, and omega-regular properties. Thus, we claim that our relations and metrics provide the canonical extensions to games, of the classical notion of bisimulation for transition systems. We develop our results both for equivalences and metrics, which generalize bisimulation, and for asymmetrical versions, which generalize simulation.",2008-06-30T17:55:15Z,2008-09-10T22:36:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4956v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4956v2,"cs.LO, F.4.1; F.1.1"
A Multivariate Regression Approach to Association Analysis of   Quantitative Trait Network,"Seyoung Kim, Kyung-Ah Sohn, Eric P. Xing","Many complex disease syndromes such as asthma consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes, raising a new technical challenge in identifying genetic variations associated simultaneously with correlated traits. In this study, we propose a new statistical framework called graph-guided fused lasso (GFlasso) to address this issue in a principled way. Our approach explicitly represents the dependency structure among the quantitative traits as a network, and leverages this trait network to encode structured regularizations in a multivariate regression model over the genotypes and traits, so that the genetic markers that jointly influence subgroups of highly correlated traits can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity. While most of the traditional methods examined each phenotype independently and combined the results afterwards, our approach analyzes all of the traits jointly in a single statistical method, and borrow information across correlated phenotypes to discover the genetic markers that perturbe a subset of correlated triats jointly rather than a single trait. Using simulated datasets based on the HapMap consortium data and an asthma dataset, we compare the performance of our method with the single-marker analysis, and other sparse regression methods such as the ridge regression and the lasso that do not use any structural information in the traits. Our results show that there is a significant advantage in detecting the true causal SNPs when we incorporate the correlation pattern in traits using our proposed methods.",2008-11-13T03:44:48Z,2008-11-13T03:44:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2026v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2026v1,"stat.ML, q-bio.GN, q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM, stat.ME"

The correct quantitative handling of compartments is, therefore, extremely important when modelling real biochemical systems. The Bio-PEPA process algebra is equipped with the capability of explicitly defining quantitative information such as compartment volumes and membrane surface areas. Furthermore, the recent development of the Bio-PEPA Eclipse Plug-in allows us to perform a correct stochastic simulation of multi-compartmental models.

We define the time of a market shock T_{c} to be the time for which the market volatility V(T_{c}) has a peak that exceeds a predetermined threshold. The cascade of high volatility ""aftershocks"" triggered by the ""main shock"" is quantitatively similar to earthquakes and solar flares, which have been described by three empirical laws --- the Omori law, the productivity law, and the Bath law. We analyze the most traded 531 stocks in U.S. markets during the two-year period 2001-2002 at the 1-minute time resolution. We find quantitative relations between (i) the ""main shock"" magnitude M \equiv \log V(T_{c}) occurring at the time T_{c} of each of the 219 ""volatility quakes"" analyzed, and (ii) the parameters quantifying the decay of volatility aftershocks as well as the volatility preshocks. We also find that stocks with larger trading activity react more strongly and more quickly to market shocks than stocks with smaller trading activity. Our findings characterize the typical volatility response conditional on M, both at the market and the individual stock scale. We argue that there is potential utility in these three statistical quantitative relations with applications in option pricing and volatility trading.",2010-06-09T19:28:27Z,2010-10-03T12:56:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1882v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.1882v2,"q-fin.TR, physics.geo-ph, physics.soc-ph, q-fin.ST"
Stable marriage problems with quantitative preferences,"Maria Silvia Pini, Francesca Rossi, Brent Venable, Toby Walsh","The stable marriage problem is a well-known problem of matching men to women so that no man and woman, who are not married to each other, both prefer each other. Such a problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical stable marriage problem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members of the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage problems with quantitative preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a score for each woman (resp., man). Such problems are more expressive than the classical stable marriage problems. Moreover, in some real-life situations it is more natural to express scores (to model, for example, profits or costs) rather than a qualitative preference ordering. In this context, we define new notions of stability and optimality, and we provide algorithms to find marriages which are stable and/or optimal according to these notions. While expressivity greatly increases by adopting quantitative preferences, we show that in most cases the desired solutions can be found by adapting existing algorithms for the classical stable marriage problem.",2010-07-29T06:37:12Z,2010-07-29T06:37:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.5120v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.5120v1,"cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.MA, I.2.4"
Statistical Genetics and Evolution of Quantitative Traits,"Richard A. Neher, Boris I. Shraiman","The distribution and heritability of many traits depends on numerous loci in the genome. In general, the astronomical number of possible genotypes makes the system with large numbers of loci difficult to describe. Multilocus evolution, however, greatly simplifies in the limit of weak selection and frequent recombination. In this limit, populations rapidly reach Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) in which the dynamics of the full genotype distribution, including correlations between alleles at different loci, can be parameterized by the allele frequencies. This review provides a simplified exposition of the concept and mathematics of QLE which is central to the statistical description of genotypes in sexual populations. We show how key results of Quantitative Genetics such as the generalized Fisher's ""Fundamental Theorem"", along with Wright's Adaptive Landscape, emerge within QLE from the dynamics of the genotype distribution. We then discuss under what circumstances QLE is applicable, and what the breakdown of QLE implies for the population structure and the dynamics of selection. Understanding of the fundamental aspects of multilocus evolution obtained through simplified models may be helpful in providing conceptual and computational tools to address the challenges arising in the studies of complex quantitative phenotypes of practical interest.",2011-08-08T08:43:56Z,2011-08-08T08:43:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1630v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1630v1,"q-bio.PE, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph"

The main shortcoming of these tools is their inability to parallel process data using multi-core computing units to tackle the problem of larger data sets. This critically handicaps the ability to make a quantitative interpretation of spatial correlations in chemical composition, since a significant amount of the data is missed during subsequent analysis. In addition, since these visualization tools are not open-source software there is always a problem with developing a common language for the interpretation of data. In this contribution we present results of our work on using an open-source advanced interactive visualization software tool, which overcomes the difficulty of visualizing larger data sets by supporting parallel rendering on a graphical user interface or script user interface and permits quantitative analysis of atom probe tomography data in real time.

A sparse conditional Gaussian graphical model for analysis of genetical   genomics data,"Jianxin Yin, Hongzhe Li","Genetical genomics experiments have now been routinely conducted to measure both the genetic markers and gene expression data on the same subjects. The gene expression levels are often treated as quantitative traits and are subject to standard genetic analysis in order to identify the gene expression quantitative loci (eQTL). However, the genetic architecture for many gene expressions may be complex, and poorly estimated genetic architecture may compromise the inferences of the dependency structures of the genes at the transcriptional level. In this paper we introduce a sparse conditional Gaussian graphical model for studying the conditional independent relationships among a set of gene expressions adjusting for possible genetic effects where the gene expressions are modeled with seemingly unrelated regressions. We present an efficient coordinate descent algorithm to obtain the penalized estimation of both the regression coefficients and the sparse concentration matrix. The corresponding graph can be used to determine the conditional independence among a group of genes while adjusting for shared genetic effects.

By sparsistency, we mean the property that all parameters that are zero are actually estimated as zero with probability tending to one.

Quantifying the interdisciplinarity of scientific journals and fields,"Filipi Nascimento Silva, Francisco Aparecido Rodrigues, Osvaldo Novais de Oliveira Junior, Luciano da Fontoura Costa","There is an overall perception of increased interdisciplinarity in science, but this is difficult to confirm quantitatively owing to the lack of adequate methods to evaluate subjective phenomena. This is no different from the difficulties in establishing quantitative relationships in human and social sciences. In this paper we quantified the interdisciplinarity of scientific journals and science fields by using an entropy measurement based on the diversity of the subject categories of journals citing a specific journal. The methodology consisted in building citation networks using the Journal Citation Reports database, in which the nodes were journals and edges were established based on citations among journals. The overall network for the 11-year period (1999-2009) studied was small-world and scale free with regard to the in-strength. Upon visualizing the network topology an overall structure of the various science fields could be inferred, especially their interconnections. We confirmed quantitatively that science fields are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, with the degree of interdisplinarity (i.e. entropy) correlating strongly with the in-strength of journals and with the impact factor.",2012-03-21T19:43:33Z,2012-03-21T19:43:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4807v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4807v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.DL, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an"
Continuous time Boolean modeling for biological signaling: application   of Gillespie algorithm,"Gautier Stoll, Eric Viara, Emmanuel Barillot, Laurence Calzone","This article presents an algorithm that allows modeling of biological networks in a qualitative framework with continuous time. Mathematical modeling is used as a systems biology tool to answer biological questions, and more precisely, to validate a network that describes biological observations and to predict the effect of perturbations.   We propose a modeling approach that is intrinsically continuous in time. The algorithm presented here fills the gap between qualitative and quantitative modeling. It is based on continuous time Markov process applied on a Boolean state space. In order to describe the temporal evolution, we explicitly specify the transition rates for each node. For that purpose, we built a language that can be seen as a generalization of Boolean equations. The values of transition rates have a natural interpretation: it is the inverse of the time for the transition to occur. Mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set of ordinary differential equations on probability distributions; therefore, it can be seen as an approach in between quantitative and qualitative.   We developed a C++ software, MaBoSS, that is able to simulate such a system by applying Kinetic Monte-Carlo (or Gillespie algorithm) in the Boolean state space. This software, parallelized and optimized, computes temporal evolution of probability distributions and can also estimate stationary distributions. Applications of Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo have been demonstrated for two qualitative models: a toy model and a published p53/Mdm2 model. Our approach allows to describe kinetic phenomena which were difficult to handle in the original models. In particular, transient effects are represented by time dependent probability distributions, interpretable in terms of cell populations.",2012-04-04T16:47:33Z,2012-05-29T13:51:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0997v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0997v2,"q-bio.MN, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Virus Replication as a Phenotypic Version of Polynucleotide Evolution,"Fernando Antoneli, Francisco Bosco, Diogo Castro, Luiz Mario Janini","In this paper we revisit and adapt to viral evolution an approach based on the theory of branching process advanced by Demetrius, Schuster and Sigmund (""Polynucleotide evolution and branching processes"", Bull. Math. Biol. 46 (1985) 239-262), in their study of polynucleotide evolution. By taking into account beneficial effects we obtain a non-trivial multivariate generalization of their single-type branching process model. Perturbative techniques allows us to obtain analytical asymptotic expressions for the main global parameters of the model which lead to the following rigorous results: (i) a new criterion for ""no sure extinction"", (ii) a generalization and proof, for this particular class of models, of the lethal mutagenesis criterion proposed by Bull, Sanju\'an and Wilke (""Theory of lethal mutagenesis for viruses"", J. Virology 18 (2007) 2930-2939), (iii) a new proposal for the notion of relaxation time with a quantitative prescription for its evaluation, (iv) the quantitative description of the evolution of the expected values in in four distinct ""stages"": extinction threshold, lethal mutagenesis, stationary ""equilibrium"" and transient.

Learning a peptide-protein binding affinity predictor with kernel ridge   regression,"Sébastien Giguère, Mario Marchand, François Laviolette, Alexandre Drouin, Jacques Corbeil","We propose a specialized string kernel for small bio-molecules, peptides and pseudo-sequences of binding interfaces. The kernel incorporates physico-chemical properties of amino acids and elegantly generalize eight kernels, such as the Oligo, the Weighted Degree, the Blended Spectrum, and the Radial Basis Function. We provide a low complexity dynamic programming algorithm for the exact computation of the kernel and a linear time algorithm for it's approximation. Combined with kernel ridge regression and SupCK, a novel binding pocket kernel, the proposed kernel yields biologically relevant and good prediction accuracy on the PepX database. For the first time, a machine learning predictor is capable of accurately predicting the binding affinity of any peptide to any protein. The method was also applied to both single-target and pan-specific Major Histocompatibility Complex class II benchmark datasets and three Quantitative Structure Affinity Model benchmark datasets.   On all benchmarks, our method significantly (p-value < 0.057) outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods at predicting peptide-protein binding affinities. The proposed approach is flexible and can be applied to predict any quantitative biological activity.

Semi-Quantitative Group Testing: A Unifying Framework for Group Testing   with Applications in Genotyping,"Amin Emad, Olgica Milenkovic","We propose a novel group testing method, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome screening experiments. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an integer-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a unifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing models are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the notion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable codes, representing generalizations of classical disjunct and separable codes. We describe several combinatorial and probabilistic constructions for such codes. While for most of these constructions we assume that the number of defectives is much smaller than total number of test subjects, we also consider the case in which there is no restriction on the number of defectives and they may be as large as the total number of subjects. For the codes constructed in this paper, we describe a number of efficient decoding algorithms. In addition, we describe a belief propagation decoder for sparse SQGT codes for which no other efficient decoder is currently known. Finally, we define the notion of capacity of SQGT and evaluate it for some special choices of parameters using information theoretic methods.",2012-10-09T04:21:57Z,2013-10-08T18:16:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2484v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.2484v2,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Identifying and Mapping Cell-type Specific Chromatin Programming of Gene   Expression,"Troels T. Marstrand, John D. Storey","A problem of substantial interest is to systematically map variation in chromatin structure to gene expression regulation across conditions, environments, or differentiated cell types. We developed and applied a quantitative framework for determining the existence, strength, and type of relationship between high-resolution chromatin structure in terms of DNaseI hypersensitivity (DHS) and genome-wide gene expression levels in 20 diverse human cell lines. We show that ~25% of genes show cell-type specific expression explained by alterations in chromatin structure. We find that distal regions of chromatin structure (e.g., +/- 200kb) capture more genes with this relationship than local regions (e.g., +/- 2.5kb), yet the local regions show a more pronounced effect. By exploiting variation across cell-types, we were capable of pinpointing the most likely hypersensitive sites related to cell-type specific expression, which we show have a range of contextual usages. This quantitative framework is likely applicable to other settings aimed at relating continuous genomic measurements to gene expression variation.",2012-10-11T18:25:26Z,2012-10-11T18:25:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3313v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3313v1,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.GN, stat.AP, stat.ME"
A Computational Model of Liver Iron Metabolism,"Simon Mitchell, Pedro Mendes","Iron is essential for all known life due to its redox properties, however these same properties can also lead to its toxicity in overload through the production of reactive oxygen species. Robust systemic and cellular control are required to maintain safe levels of iron and the liver seems to be where this regulation is mainly located. Iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases and as our understanding of iron metabolism improves the list of iron-related disorders grows. Recent developments have resulted in greater knowledge of the fate of iron in the body and have led to a detailed map of its metabolism, however a quantitative understanding at the systems level of how its components interact to produce tight regulation remains elusive.   A mechanistic computational model of human liver iron metabolism, which includes the core regulatory components, was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and on their kinetic properties, obtained from several publications. The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data, and it is able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following an oral dose of iron was compared to a clinical time course study and the simulation was found to recreate the dynamics and time scale of the systems response to iron challenge. A disease simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation. The simulation provides a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease.   This model supports and supplements understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve further our knowledge of this system.",2013-08-27T11:21:39Z,2013-08-27T11:21:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5826v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.5826v1,"q-bio.MN, 92C42, J.3"
Cellular network entropy as the energy potential in Waddington's   differentiation landscape,"Christopher R. S. Banerji, Diego Miranda-Saavedra, Simone Severini, Martin Widschwendter, Tariq Enver, Joseph X. Zhou, Andrew E. Teschendorff","Differentiation is a key cellular process in normal tissue development that is significantly altered in cancer. Although molecular signatures characterising pluripotency and multipotency exist, there is, as yet, no single quantitative mark of a cellular sample's position in the global differentiation hierarchy. Here we adopt a systems view and consider the sample's network entropy, a measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, computable from a sample's genome-wide expression profile. We demonstrate that network entropy provides a quantitative, in-silico, readout of the average undifferentiated state of the profiled cells, recapitulating the known hierarchy of pluripotent, multipotent and differentiated cell types. Network entropy further exhibits dynamic changes in time course differentiation data, and in line with a sample's differentiation stage. In disease, network entropy predicts a higher level of cellular plasticity in cancer stem cell populations compared to ordinary cancer cells. Importantly, network entropy also allows identification of key differentiation pathways. Our results are consistent with the view that pluripotency is a statistical property defined at the cellular population level, correlating with intra-sample heterogeneity, and driven by the degree of signaling promiscuity in cells. In summary, network entropy provides a quantitative measure of a cell's undifferentiated state, defining its elevation in Waddington's landscape.",2013-10-26T08:36:12Z,2013-10-26T08:36:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7083v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7083v1,"q-bio.MN, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.GN"
Spatial Confinement of the IBEX Ribbon: A Dominant Turbulence Mechanism,Philip A. Isenberg,"The narrow ribbon of enhanced energetic neutral atom flux observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has prompted numerous ideas to explain its structure and properties. One of these ideas is the ""neutral solar wind"" scenario, which identifies the source particles as pickup protons in the local interstellar medium originating in solar wind charge-exchange interactions. This scenario has been thought to require unrealistically weak pitch-angle scattering of the pickup protons to explain the narrow structure. Recently, Schwadron & McComas (2013) suggested that this structure could result from a spatial retention of the pickup protons, rather than from a restricted pitch-angle distribution. Here, we present a physically motivated, quantitative mechanism to produce such a spatial configuration. This mechanism is based on the ""dominant turbulence"" assumption, which can be applied where the production of new pickup protons is slow, and has been used to successfully explain the level of turbulent heating observed in the outer solar wind. This formalism predicts a pickup isotropization process which adds or subtracts energy from the ambient turbulent fluctuations, depending on the initial pitch angle of the pickup protons. We show that a simple model of this process can yield a ribbon structure in qualitative agreement with the observations. The results of this simple model are not yet quantitatively satisfactory, but we suggest several improvements which may reduce the quantitative discrepancy.",2014-04-08T15:00:34Z,2014-04-08T15:00:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2170v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2170v1,"astro-ph.SR, physics.space-ph"
Rheotaxis facilitates upstream navigation of mammalian sperm cells,"Vasily Kantsler, Jörn Dunkel, Martyn Blayney, Raymond E. Goldstein","A major puzzle in biology is how mammalian sperm determine and maintain the correct swimming direction during the various phases of the sexual reproduction process. Whilst chemotaxis is assumed to dominate in the immediate vicinity of the ovum, it is unclear which biochemical or physical cues guide spermatozoa on their long journey towards the egg cell. Currently debated mechanisms range from peristaltic pumping to temperature sensing (thermotaxis) and direct response to fluid flow variations (rheotaxis), but little is known quantitatively about their relative importance. Here, we report the first quantitative experimental study of mammalian sperm rheotaxis. Using microfluidic devices, we investigate systematically the swimming behavior of human and bull sperm over the whole range of physiologically relevant shear rates and viscosities. Our measurements show that the interplay of fluid shear, steric surface-interactions and chirality of the flagellar beat leads to a stable upstream spiraling motion of sperm cells, thus providing a generic and robust rectification mechanism to support mammalian fertilisation. To rationalise these findings, we identify a minimal mathematical model that is capable of describing quantitatively the experimental observations. The combined experimental and theoretical evidence supports the hypothesis that the shape and beat patterns of mammalian sperm cells have evolved to optimally exploit rheotaxis for long-distance navigation.",2014-05-26T07:48:25Z,2014-05-26T07:48:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6489v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6489v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft, q-bio.CB"
How structurally stable are global socioeconomic systems?,"Serguei Saavedra, Rudolf P. Rohr, Luis J. Gilarranz, Jordi Bascompte","The stability analysis of socioeconomic systems has been centered on answering whether small perturbations when a system is in a given quantitative state will push the system permanently to a different quantitative state. However, typically the quantitative state of socioeconomic systems is subject to constant change. Therefore, a key stability question that has been under-investigated is how strong the conditions of a system itself can change before the system moves to a qualitatively different behavior, i.e., how structurally stable the systems is. Here, we introduce a framework to investigate the structural stability of socioeconomic systems formed by the network of interactions among agents competing for resources. We measure the structural stability of the system as the range of conditions in the distribution and availability of resources compatible with the qualitative behavior in which all the constituent agents can be self-sustained across time. To illustrate our framework, we study an empirical representation of the global socioeconomic system formed by countries sharing and competing for multinational companies used as proxy for resources. We demonstrate that the structural stability of the system is inversely associated with the level of competition and the level of heterogeneity in the distribution of resources. Importantly, we show that the qualitative behavior of the observed global socioeconomic system is highly sensitive to changes in the distribution of resources. We believe this work provides a methodological basis to develop sustainable strategies for socioeconomic systems subject to constantly changing conditions.",2014-08-29T10:19:57Z,2014-08-29T10:19:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.6973v1,"physics.soc-ph, q-bio.PE, q-fin.GN"
Cross correlations of the American baby names,"Paolo Barucca, Jacopo Rocchi, Enzo Marinari, Giorgio Parisi, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi","The quantitative description of cultural evolution is a challenging task. The most difficult part of the problem is probably to find the appropriate measurable quantities that can make more quantitative such evasive concepts as, for example, dynamics of cultural movements, behavior patterns and traditions of the people. A strategy to tackle this issue is to observe particular features of human activities, i.e. cultural traits, such as names given to newborns. We study the names of babies born in the United States of America from 1910 to 2012. Our analysis shows that groups of different correlated states naturally emerge in different epochs, and we are able to follow and decrypt their evolution. While these groups of states are stable across many decades, a sudden reorganization occurs in the last part of the twentieth century. We think that this kind of quantitative analysis can be possibly extended to other cultural traits: although databases covering more than one century (as the one we used) are rare, the cultural evolution on shorter time scales can be studied thanks to the fact that many human activities are usually recorded in the present digital era.",2014-10-10T13:01:58Z,2015-05-14T03:07:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2771v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2771v2,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.SI"
Crossing the bottleneck of rain formation,"Martin Rohloff, Tobias Lapp, Jürgen Vollmer","The demixing of a binary fluid mixture, under gravity, is a two stage process. Initially droplets, or in general aggregates, grow diffusively by collecting supersaturation from the bulk phase. Subsequently, when the droplets have grown to a size, where their Peclet number is of order unity, buoyancy substantially enhances droplet growth. The dynamics approaches a finite-time singularity where the droplets are removed from the system by precipitation. The two growth regimes are separated by a bottleneck of minimal droplet growth. Here, we present a low-dimensional model addressing the time span required to cross the bottleneck, and we hence determine the time, \Delta t, from initial droplet growth to rainfall. Our prediction faithfully captures the dependence of \Delta t on the ramp rate of the droplet volume fraction, \xi, the droplet number density, the interfacial tension, the mass diffusion coefficient, the mass density contrast of the coexisting phases, and the viscosity of the bulk phase. The agreement of observations and the prediction is demonstrated for methanol/hexane and isobutoxyethanol/water mixtures where we determined \Delta t for a vast range of ramp rates, \xi, and temperatures. The very good quantitative agreement demonstrates that it is sufficient for binary mixtures to consider (i) droplet growth by diffusive accretion that relaxes supersaturation, and (ii) growth by collisions of sedimenting droplets. An analytical solution of the resulting model provides a quantitative description of the dependence of \Delta t on the ramp rate and the material constants. Extensions of the model that will admit a quantitative prediction of \Delta t in other settings are addressed.",2014-11-28T14:37:13Z,2014-11-28T14:37:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7882v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.7882v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.chem-ph, physics.flu-dyn"
Representation of solutions and large-time behavior for fully nonlocal   diffusion equations,"Jukka Kemppainen, Juhana Siljander, Rico Zacher","We study the Cauchy problem for a nonlocal heat equation, which is of fractional order both in space and time. We prove four main theorems:   (i) a representation formula for classical solutions,   (ii) a quantitative decay rate at which the solution tends to the fundamental solution,   (iii) optimal $L^2$-decay of mild solutions in all dimensions,   (iv) $L^2$-decay of weak solutions via energy methods.   The first result relies on a delicate analysis of the definition of classical solutions. After proving the representation formula we carefully analyze the integral representation to obtain the quantitative decay rates of (ii).   Next we use Fourier analysis techniques to obtain the optimal decay rate for mild solutions. Here we encounter the critical dimension phenomenon where the decay rate attains the decay rate of that in a bounded domain for large enough dimensions. Consequently, the decay rate does not anymore improve when the dimension increases. The theory is markedly different from that of the standard caloric functions and this substantially complicates the analysis.   Finally, we use energy estimates and a comparison principle to prove a quantitative decay rate for weak solutions defined via a variational formulation. Our main idea is to show that the $L^2$-norm is actually a subsolution to a purely time-fractional problem which allows us to use the known theory to obtain the result.",2015-05-11T20:56:21Z,2015-07-09T07:12:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02803v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02803v2,"math.AP, Primary 35R11, Secondary 45K05, 35C15, 47G20"

As an application we consider Lorenz-like two dimensional maps (piecewise hyperbolic with unbounded contraction and expansion rate): we prove that those systems have a spectral gap and we show a quantitative estimate for their statistical stability.

Different mechanisms have been proposed for explaining the plasmonic CD, however, a quantitative one like ab initio mechanism in chiral molecules is still unavailable. In this work, a mechanism similar to the chiral molecules is analyzed. The giant extrinsic circular dichroism of plasmonic splitting rectangle ring is quantitatively investigated theoretically. The interplay of electric and magnetic modes of the meta-structure is proposed to explain the giant CD. The interplay is analyzed both in an analytical coupled electric-magnetic dipoles model and finite element method model. The surface charge distributions show that the circular current yielded in the splitting rectangle ring makes it behave like a magneton at some resonant modes, which interact with electric modes and results in a mixing of the two kinds of modes. The strong interplay of the two kinds of modes is mainly responsible for the giant CD.The analysis of the chiral near field of the structure shows potential applications in chiral molecule sensing.",2015-11-15T13:51:56Z,2015-11-15T13:51:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04702v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04702v1,"cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.optics"
Discrete diffraction managed solitons: Threshold phenomena and rapid   decay for general nonlinearities,"Mi-Ran Choi, Dirk Hundertmark, Young-Ran Lee","We prove a threshold phenomenon for the existence/non-existence of energy minimizing solitary solutions of the diffraction management equation for strictly positive and zero average diffraction. Our methods allow for a large class of nonlinearities, they are, for example, allowed to change sign, and the weakest possible condition, it only has to be locally integrable, on the local diffraction profile. The solutions are found as minimizers of a nonlinear and nonlocal variational problem which is translation invariant. There exists a critical threshold ?cr such that minimizers for this variational problem exist if their power is bigger than ?cr and no minimizers exist with power less than the critical threshold. We also give simple criteria for the finiteness and strict positivity of the critical threshold. Our proof of existence of minimizers is rather direct and avoids the use of Lions' concentration compactness argument.   Furthermore, we give precise quantitative lower bounds on the exponential decay rate of the diffraction management solitons, which confirm the physical heuristic prediction for the asymptotic decay rate. Moreover, for ground state solutions, these bounds give a quantitative lower bound for the divergence of the exponential decay rate in the limit of vanishing average diffraction. For zero average diffraction, we prove quantitative bounds which show that the solitons decay much faster than exponentially.

Incremental Quantitative Analysis on Dynamic Costs,"Duc-Hiep Chu, Joxan Jaffar, Vijayaraghavan Murali","In quantitative program analysis, values are assigned to execution traces to represent a quality measure. Such analyses cover important applications, e.g. resource usage. Examining all traces is well known to be intractable and therefore traditional algorithms reason over an over-approximated set. Typically, inaccuracy arises due to inclusion of infeasible paths in this set. Thus path-sensitivity is one cure. However, there is another reason for the inaccuracy: that the cost model, i.e., the way in which the analysis of each trace is quantified, is dynamic. That is, the cost of a trace is dependent on the context in which the trace is executed. Thus the goal of accurate analysis, already challenged by path-sensitivity, is now further challenged by context-sensitivity.   In this paper, we address the problem of quantitative analysis defined over a dynamic cost model. Our algorithm is an ""anytime"" algorithm: it generates an answer quickly, but if the analysis resource budget allows, it progressively produces better solutions via refinement iterations. The result of each iteration remains sound, but importantly, must converge to an exact analysis when given an unlimited resource budget. In order to be scalable, our algorithm is designed to be incremental.

"Discovering, quantifying, and displaying attacks","Roberto Vigo, Flemming Nielson, Hanne Riis Nielson","In the design of software and cyber-physical systems, security is often perceived as a qualitative need, but can only be attained quantitatively. Especially when distributed components are involved, it is hard to predict and confront all possible attacks. A main challenge in the development of complex systems is therefore to discover attacks, quantify them to comprehend their likelihood, and communicate them to non-experts for facilitating the decision process. To address this three-sided challenge we propose a protection analysis over the Quality Calculus that (i) computes all the sets of data required by an attacker to reach a given location in a system, (ii) determines the cheapest set of such attacks for a given notion of cost, and (iii) derives an attack tree that displays the attacks graphically. The protection analysis is first developed in a qualitative setting, and then extended to quantitative settings following an approach applicable to a great many contexts. The quantitative formulation is implemented as an optimisation problem encoded into Satisfiability Modulo Theories, allowing us to deal with complex cost structures.

A Unified Paradigm of Organized Complexity and Semantic Information   Theory,Tatsuaki Okamoto,"One of the most fundamental problems in science is to define {\it quantitatively} the complexity of organized matters, i.e., {\it organized complexity}. Although many measures have been proposed toward this aim in previous decades, there is no agreed upon definition. This paper presents a new quantitative definition of organized complexity. This definition {\it simultaneously} captures the three major features of complexity: computational (similar to logical depth), descriptional (similar to the Kolmogorov complexity and effective complexity) and distributional (similar to statistical complexity). In addition, the proposed definition is computable and can measure both probabilistic and deterministic forms of objects in a unified manner. The proposed definition is based on circuits rather than Turing machines and $\epsilon$-machines. We give several criteria required for organized complexity measures and show that the proposed definition satisfies all of them for the first time. We then apply this quantitative definition to formulate a {\it semantic information theory}. We present the first formal definition of a {\it semantic information amount}, which is the core concept of the semantic information theory, that is based only on concretely defined notions. Previous semantic information theories defined this amount under some a priori information which is not concretely specified. We then unveil several fundamental properties in the semantic information theory, e.g., a semantic source coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and effectiveness coding theorem. Although the semantic information theory has a long history of research going back more than six decades, there has been no study on its relation to organized complexity. This paper offers the first unified paradigm of organized complexity and semantic information theory.",2016-07-29T17:19:33Z,2016-07-29T17:19:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00941v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00941v1,"cs.IT, math.IT, nlin.AO, nlin.CG, q-bio.QM"
Modeling cognitive deficits following neurodegenerative diseases and   traumatic brain injuries with deep convolutional neural networks,"Bethany Lusch, Jake Weholt, Pedro D. Maia, J. Nathan Kutz","The accurate diagnosis and assessment of neurodegenerative disease and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) remain open challenges. Both cause cognitive and functional deficits due to focal axonal swellings (FAS), but it is difficult to deliver a prognosis due to our limited ability to assess damaged neurons at a cellular level in vivo. We simulate the effects of neurodegenerative disease and TBI using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model of cognition. We utilize biophysically relevant statistical data on FAS to damage the connections in CNNs in a functionally relevant way. We incorporate energy constraints on the brain by pruning the CNNs to be less over-engineered. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that damage leads to human-like mistakes. Our experiments also provide quantitative assessments of how accuracy is affected by various types and levels of damage. The deficit resulting from a fixed amount of damage greatly depends on which connections are randomly injured, providing intuition for why it is difficult to predict impairments. There is a large degree of subjectivity when it comes to interpreting cognitive deficits from complex systems such as the human brain. However, we provide important insight and a quantitative framework for disorders in which FAS are implicated.",2016-12-13T22:50:56Z,2016-12-13T22:50:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04423v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04423v1,"q-bio.NC, q-bio.QM, stat.ML"
Discretization error cancellation in electronic structure calculation: a   quantitative study,"Eric Cancès, Geneviève Dusson","It is often claimed that error cancellation plays an essential role in quantum chemistry and first-principle simulation for condensed matter physics and materials science. Indeed, while the energy of a large, or even medium-size, molecular system cannot be estimated numerically within chemical accuracy (typically 1 kcal/mol or 1 mHa), it is considered that the energy difference between two configurations of the same system can be computed in practice within the desired accuracy.   The purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative study of discretization error cancellation. The latter is the error component due to the fact that the model used in the calculation (e.g. Kohn-Sham LDA) must be discretized in a finite basis set to be solved by a computer. We first report comprehensive numerical simulations performed with Abinit on two simple chemical systems, the hydrogen molecule on the one hand, and a system consisting of two oxygen atoms and four hydrogen atoms on the other hand. We observe that errors on energy differences are indeed significantly smaller than errors on energies, but that these two quantities asymptotically converge at the same rate when the energy cut-off goes to infinity. We then analyze a simple one-dimensional periodic Schr\""odinger equation with Dirac potentials, for which analytic solutions are available. This allows us to explain the discretization error cancellation phenomenon on this test case with quantitative mathematical arguments.",2017-01-17T12:28:17Z,2017-01-17T12:28:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04643v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.04643v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, math.NA, physics.comp-ph"
Giant ripples on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sculpted by sunset   thermal wind,"P. Jia, B. Andreotti, P. Claudin","Explaining the unexpected presence of dune-like patterns at the surface of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko requires conceptual and quantitative advances in the understanding of surface and outgassing processes. We show here that vapor flow emitted by the comet around its perihelion spreads laterally in a surface layer, due to the strong pressure difference between zones illuminated by sunlight and those in shadow. For such thermal winds to be dense enough to transport grains -- ten times greater than previous estimates -- outgassing must take place through a surface porous granular layer, and that layer must be composed of grains whose roughness lowers cohesion consistently with contact mechanics. The linear stability analysis of the problem, entirely tested against laboratory experiments, quantitatively predicts the emergence of bedforms in the observed wavelength range, and their propagation at the scale of a comet revolution. Although generated by a rarefied atmosphere, they are paradoxically analogous to ripples emerging on granular beds submitted to viscous shear flows. This quantitative agreement shows that our understanding of the coupling between hydrodynamics and sediment transport is able to account for bedform emergence in extreme conditions and provides a reliable tool to predict the erosion and accretion processes controlling the evolution of small solar system bodies.",2017-03-07T20:51:40Z,2017-03-07T20:51:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02592v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02592v1,"cond-mat.soft, astro-ph.EP"
Family-specific scaling laws in bacterial genomes,"Eleonora de Lazzari, Jacopo Grilli, Sergei Maslov, Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino","Among several quantitative invariants found in evolutionary genomics, one of the most striking is the scaling of the overall abundance of proteins, or protein domains, sharing a specific functional annotation across genomes of given size. The size of these functional categories change, on average, as power-laws in the total number of protein-coding genes. Here, we show that such regularities are not restricted to the overall behavior of high-level functional categories, but also exist systematically at the level of single evolutionary families of protein domains. Specifically, the number of proteins within each family follows family-specific scaling laws with genome size. Functionally similar sets of families tend to follow similar scaling laws, but this is not always the case. To understand this systematically, we provide a comprehensive classification of families based on their scaling properties. Additionally, we develop a quantitative score for the heterogeneity of the scaling of families belonging to a given category or predefined group. Under the common reasonable assumption that selection is driven solely or mainly by biological function, these findings point to fine-tuned and interdependent functional roles of specific protein domains, beyond our current functional annotations. This analysis provides a deeper view on the links between evolutionary expansion of protein families and the functional constraints shaping the gene repertoire of bacterial genomes.",2017-03-28T21:57:38Z,2017-03-28T21:57:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09822v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09822v1,"q-bio.GN, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Complexity Results for MCMC derived from Quantitative Bounds,"Jun Yang, Jeffrey S. Rosenthal","This paper considers how to obtain MCMC quantitative convergence bounds which can be translated into tight complexity bounds in high-dimensional {settings}. We propose a modified drift-and-minorization approach, which establishes generalized drift conditions defined in subsets of the state space. The subsets are called the ""large sets"", and are chosen to rule out some ""bad"" states which have poor drift property when the dimension of the state space gets large. Using the ""large sets"" together with a ""fitted family of drift functions"", a quantitative bound can be obtained which can be translated into a tight complexity bound. As a demonstration, we analyze several Gibbs samplers and obtain complexity upper bounds for the mixing time. In particular, for one example of Gibbs sampler which is related to the James--Stein estimator, we show that the number of iterations required for the Gibbs sampler to converge is constant under certain conditions on the observed data and the initial state. It is our hope that this modified drift-and-minorization approach can be employed in many other specific examples to obtain complexity bounds for high-dimensional Markov chains.",2017-08-02T17:06:28Z,2022-05-10T22:53:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00829v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00829v6,"stat.CO, math.PR"
Classification of volcanic ash particles using a convolutional neural   network and probability,"Daigo Shoji, Rina Noguchi, Shizuka Otsuki, Hideitsu Hino","Analyses of volcanic ash are typically performed either by qualitatively classifying ash particles by eye or by quantitatively parameterizing its shape and texture. While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative analyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing complex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90% accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.",2018-05-31T07:30:48Z,2018-05-31T07:30:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12353v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12353v1,"physics.geo-ph, cs.CV, cs.LG"

Accurate and precise use of handheld motion controllers in VR gaming applications may be limited for patients with upper limb tremor. In parallel, objective tools measuring tremor are not in widespread, routine clinical use. We used a commercially available VR system and designed a challenging virtual-balloon-popping test mimicking a common nose-to-target pointing task used by medical practitioners to subjectively evaluate tremor in the exam room. Within our VR experience, we offer a software mode which uses a low-pass filter to adjust hand position and pointing orientation over a series of past data points. This digital filter creates a smoothing function for hand movement which effectively removes the patient's tremor in the VR representation. While the patient completes trials of the reaching task, quantitative data on the pathologic tremor is digitally recorded. With speed, accuracy, and the tremor components computed across three axes of movement, patients can be evaluated for their tremor amplitudes in a quantitative, replicable, and enjoyable manner.

"Fast, Precise Myelin Water Quantification using DESS MRI and Kernel   Learning","Gopal Nataraj, Jon-Fredrik Nielsen, Mingjie Gao, Jeffrey A.

Methods: We optimized combinations of steady-state (SS) scans for precisely estimating the fast-relaxing signal fraction ff of a two-compartment signal model, subject to a scan time constraint. We estimated ff from the optimized DESS acquisition using a recently developed method for rapid parameter estimation via regression with kernels (PERK). We compared DESS PERK ff estimates to conventional myelin water fraction (MWF) estimates from a longer multi-echo spin-echo (MESE) acquisition in simulation, in vivo, and ex vivo studies.   Results: Simulations demonstrate that DESS PERK ff estimators and MESE MWF estimators achieve comparable error levels. In vivo and ex vivo experiments demonstrate that MESE MWF and DESS PERK ff estimates are quantitatively comparable measures of WM myelin water content. To our knowledge, these experiments are the first to demonstrate myelin water images from a SS acquisition that are quantitatively similar to conventional MESE MWF images.   Conclusion: Combinations of fast DESS scans can be designed to enable precise ff estimation. PERK is well-suited for ff estimation.

Calibrating evanescent-wave penetration depths for biological TIRF   microscopy,"Martin Oheim, Adi Salomon, Adam Weissman, Maia Brunstein, Ute Becherer","Roughly half of a cells proteins are located at or near the plasma membrane. In this restricted space the cell senses its environment, signals to its neighbors and ex-changes cargo through exo- and endocytotic mechanisms. Ligands bind to receptors, ions flow across channel pores, and transmitters and metabolites are transported against con-centration gradients. Receptors, ion channels, pumps and transporters are the molecular substrates of these biological processes and they constitute important targets for drug discovery. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy suppresses background from cell deeper layers and provides contrast for selectively imaging dynamic processes near the basal membrane of live-cells. The optical sectioning of total internal reflection fluorescence is based on the excitation confinement of the evanescent wave generated at the glass-cell interface. How deep the excitation light actually penetrates the sample is difficult to know, making the quantitative interpretation of total internal reflection fluorescence data problematic. Nevertheless, many applications like super-resolution microscopy, colocalization, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, near-membrane fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, uncaging or photo-activation-switching, as well as single-particle tracking require the quantitative interpretation of evanescent-wave excited images. Here, we review existing techniques for characterizing evanescent fields and we provide a roadmap for comparing total internal reflection fluorescence data across images, experiments, and laboratories.",2019-01-04T19:11:58Z,2019-01-04T19:11:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01281v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01281v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Sparse Graph Codes for Non-adaptive Quantitative Group Testing,"Esmaeil Karimi, Fatemeh Kazemi, Anoosheh Heidarzadeh, Krishna R. Narayanan, Alex Sprintson","This paper considers the problem of Quantitative Group Testing (QGT). Consider a set of $N$ items among which $K$ items are defective. The QGT problem is to identify (all or a sufficiently large fraction of) the defective items, where the result of a test reveals the number of defective items in the tested group. In this work, we propose a non-adaptive QGT algorithm using sparse graph codes over bi-regular bipartite graphs with left-degree $\ell$ and right degree $r$ and binary $t$-error-correcting BCH codes. The proposed scheme provides exact recovery with probabilistic guarantee, i.e. recovers all the defective items with high probability. In particular, we show that for the sub-linear regime where $\frac{K}{N}$ vanishes as $K,N\rightarrow\infty$, the proposed algorithm requires at most ${m=c(t)K\left(t\log_2\left(\frac{\ell N}{c(t)K}+1\right)+1\right)+1}$ tests to recover all the defective items with probability approaching one as ${K,N\rightarrow\infty}$, where $c(t)$ depends only on $t$. The results of our theoretical analysis reveal that the minimum number of required tests is achieved by $t=2$. The encoding and decoding of the proposed algorithm for any $t\leq 4$ have the computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(K\log^2 \frac{N}{K})$ and $\mathcal{O}(K\log \frac{N}{K})$, respectively. Our simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a non-adaptive semi-quantitative group testing algorithm recently proposed by Abdalla \emph{et al.} in terms of the required number of tests for identifying all the defective items with high probability.",2019-01-22T22:43:48Z,2019-04-24T17:41:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07635v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07635v3,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Advances and challenges in single-molecule electron transport,"Ferdinand Evers, Richard Korytár, Sumit Tewari, Jan M. van Ruitenbeek","Electronic transport properties for single-molecule junctions have been widely measured by several techniques, including mechanically controllable break junctions, electromigration break junctions or by means of scanning tunneling microscopes. In parallel, many theoretical tools have been developed and refined for describing such transport properties and for obtaining numerical predictions. Most prominent among these theoretical tools are those based upon density functional theory. In this review, theory and experiment are critically compared and this confrontation leads to several important conclusions. The theoretically predicted trends nowadays reproduce the experimental findings quite well for series of molecules with a single well-defined control parameter, such as the length of the molecules. The quantitative agreement between theory and experiment usually is less convincing, however. Many reasons for quantitative discrepancies can be identified, from which one may decide that qualitative agreement is the best one may expect with present modeling tools. For further progress, benchmark systems are required that are sufficiently well-defined by experiment to allow quantitative testing of the approximation schemes underlying the theoretical modeling. Several key experiments can be identified suggesting that the present description may even be qualitatively incomplete in some cases. Such key experimental observations and their current models are also discussed here, leading to several suggestions for extensions of the models towards including dynamic image charges, electron correlations, and polaron formation.",2019-06-25T10:54:39Z,2020-06-28T12:24:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10449v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10449v2,"cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.chem-ph"
Uniform rectifiability and elliptic operators satisfying a Carleson   measure condition.

We settle the question of whether (quantitative) absolute continuity of the elliptic measure with respect to the surface measure and uniform rectifiability of the boundary are equivalent, in an optimal class of divergence form elliptic operators satisfying a suitable Carleson measure condition. The result can be viewed as a quantitative analogue of the Wiener criterion adapted to the singular $L^p$ data case.   The first step in this direction was taken in our previous paper [Hofmann, Martell, Mayboroda, Toro, Zhao, arXiv:1710.06157], where we considered the case in which the desired Carleson measure condition on the coefficients holds with sufficiently small constant. In this paper we establish the final, general result, that is, the ""large constant case"".

Developing Peer Instruction questions for quantitative problems for an   upper-division astronomy course,Colin S. Wallace,"Decades of research show that students learn more in classes that utilize active learning than they do in traditional, lecture-only classes. Active learning also reduces the achievement gaps that are often present between various demographic groups. Given these well-established results, instructors of upper-division astronomy courses may decide to search the astronomy education research literature in hopes of finding some guidance on common student difficulties, as well as research-validated and research-based active learning curricula. But their search will be in vain. The current literature on upper-division astronomy is essentially non-existent. This is a shame,since many upper-division astronomy students will experience conceptual and problem-solving difficulties with the quantitative problems they encounter. These difficulties may exist even if students have a strong background in mathematics. In this paper, I examine one quantitative problem that is representative of those that upper-division astronomy students are expected to solve. I list many of the subtle pieces of information that students need to understand in order to advance toward a solution and I describe how such a list can be used to generate Peer Instruction (PI) questions. I also provide guidelines for instructors who wish to develop and implement their own PI questions.

Transfer Learning with Dynamic Distribution Adaptation,"Jindong Wang, Yiqiang Chen, Wenjie Feng, Han Yu, Meiyu Huang, Qiang Yang","Transfer learning aims to learn robust classifiers for the target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. Since the source and the target domains are usually from different distributions, existing methods mainly focus on adapting the cross-domain marginal or conditional distributions. However, in real applications, the marginal and conditional distributions usually have different contributions to the domain discrepancy. Existing methods fail to quantitatively evaluate the different importance of these two distributions, which will result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. In this paper, we propose a novel concept called Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (DDA), which is capable of quantitatively evaluating the relative importance of each distribution. DDA can be easily incorporated into the framework of structural risk minimization to solve transfer learning problems. On the basis of DDA, we propose two novel learning algorithms: (1) Manifold Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (MDDA) for traditional transfer learning, and (2) Dynamic Distribution Adaptation Network (DDAN) for deep transfer learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDDA and DDAN significantly improve the transfer learning performance and setup a strong baseline over the latest deep and adversarial methods on digits recognition, sentiment analysis, and image classification. More importantly, it is shown that marginal and conditional distributions have different contributions to the domain divergence, and our DDA is able to provide good quantitative evaluation of their relative importance which leads to better performance. We believe this observation can be helpful for future research in transfer learning.",2019-09-17T02:59:22Z,2019-09-17T02:59:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08531v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08531v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
Bayesian analysis of data from segmented super-resolution images for   quantifying protein clustering,"Tina Kosǔta, Marta Cullell-Dalmau, Francesca Cella Zanacchi, Carlo Manzo","Super-resolution imaging techniques have largely improved our capabilities to visualize nanometric structures in biological systems. Their application further enables one to potentially quantitate relevant parameters to determine the molecular organization and stoichiometry in cells. However, the inherently stochastic nature of the fluorescence emission and labeling strategies imposes the use of dedicated methods to accurately measure these parameters. Here, we describe a Bayesian approach to precisely quantitate the relative abundance of molecular oligomers from segmented images. The distribution of proxies for the number of molecules in a cluster -- such as the number of localizations or the fluorescence intensity -- is fitted via a nested sampling algorithm to compare mixture models of increasing complexity and determine the optimal number of mixture components and their weights. We test the performance of the algorithm on {\it in silico} data as a function of the number of data points, threshold, and distribution shape. We compare these results to those obtained with other statistical methods, showing the improved performance of our approach. Our method provides a robust tool for model selection in fitting data extracted from fluorescence imaging, thus improving the precision of parameter determination. Importantly, the largest benefit of this method occurs for small-statistics or incomplete datasets, enabling accurate analysis at the single image level. We further present the results of its application to experimental data obtained from the super-resolution imaging of dynein in HeLa cells, confirming the presence of a mixed population of cytoplasmatic single motors and higher-order structures.",2019-09-28T19:12:27Z,2019-09-28T19:12:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13133v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13133v1,"physics.bio-ph, physics.data-an, q-bio.QM, stat.AP"

Two specification frameworks are designed along two different (but still related) lines. First, by comparing the behaviour of a system with the expected one, or by checking if such system satisfies some security requirements: we investigate a novel approximate behavioural-equivalence for comparing processes behaviour, thus extending the Generalised Non Deducibility on Composition (GNDC) approach with scores. As a second result, we equip a modal logic with semiring values with the purpose to have a weight related to the satisfaction of a formula that specifies some requested property.

Sub-Hermitian Geometry and the Quantitative Newlander-Nirenberg Theorem,Brian Street,"Given a finite collection of $C^1$ complex vector fields on a $C^2$ manifold $M$ such that they and their complex conjugates span the complexified tangent space at every point, the classical Newlander-Nirenberg theorem gives conditions on the vector fields so that there is a complex structure on $M$ with respect to which the vector fields are $T^{0,1}$. In this paper, we give intrinsic, diffeomorphic invariant, necessary and sufficient conditions on the vector fields so that they have a desired level of regularity with respect to this complex structure (i.e., smooth, real analytic, or have Zygmund regularity of some finite order). By addressing this in a quantitative way we obtain a holomorphic analog of the quantitative theory of sub-Riemannian geometry initiated by Nagel, Stein, and Wainger. We call this sub-Hermitian geometry. Moreover, we proceed more generally and obtain similar results for manifolds which have an associated formally integrable elliptic structure. This allows us to introduce a setting which generalizes both the real and complex theories.",2018-10-26T21:50:01Z,2020-04-09T18:30:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11540v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11540v5,"math.CV, math.AP, math.CA, math.DG, 32M25 (Primary), 53C17, 32W50 (Secondary)"
MRI Tissue Magnetism Quantification through Total Field Inversion with   Deep Neural Networks,"Juan Liu, Kevin M. Koch","Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) utilizes MRI signal phase to infer estimates of local tissue magnetism (magnetic susceptibility), which has been shown useful to provide novel image contrast and as biomarkers of abnormal tissue. QSM requires addressing a challenging post-processing problem: filtering of image phase estimates and inversion of the phase to susceptibility relationship. A wide variety of quantification errors, robustness limitations, and artifacts plague QSM algorithms. To overcome these limitations, a robust deep-learning-based single-step QSM reconstruction approach is proposed and demonstrated. This neural network was trained using magnetostatic physics simulations based on in-vivo data sources. Random perturbations were added to the physics simulations to provide sufficient input-label pairs for the training purposes. The network was quantitatively tested using gold-standard in-silico labeled datasets against established QSM total field inversion approaches. In addition, the algorithm was applied to susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) data collected on a cohort of clinical subjects with brain hemmhorage. When quantitatively compared against gold-standard in-silico labels, the proposed algorithm outperformed the existing comparable approaches. High quality QSM were consistently estimated from clinical susceptibility-weighted data on 100 subjects without any noticeable inversion failures. The proposed approach was able to robustly generate high quality QSM with improved accuracy in in-silico gold-standard experiments. QSM produced by the proposed method can be generated in real-time on existing MRI scanner platforms and provide enhanced visualization and quantification of magnetism-based tissue contrasts.",2019-04-11T20:18:27Z,2019-04-11T20:18:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07105v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07105v1,"physics.med-ph, cs.AI"
Super-resolution microscopy via ptychographic structured modulation of a   diffuser,"Pengming Song, Shaowei Jiang, He Zhang, Zichao Bian, Chengfei Guo, Kazunori Hoshino, Guoan Zheng","We report a new coherent imaging technique, termed ptychographic structured modulation (PSM), for quantitative super-resolution microscopy. In this technique, we place a thin diffuser (i.e., a scattering lens) in between the sample and the objective lens to modulate the complex light waves from the object. The otherwise inaccessible high-resolution object information can thus be encoded into the captured images. We then employ a ptychographic phase retrieval process to jointly recover the exit wavefront of the complex object and the unknown diffuser profile. Unlike the illumination-based super-resolution approach, the recovered image of our approach depends upon how the complex wavefront exits the sample - not enters it. Therefore, the sample thickness becomes irrelevant during reconstruction. After recovery, we can propagate the super-resolution complex wavefront to any position along the optical axis. We validate our approach using a resolution target, a quantitative phase target, a two-layer sample, and a thick PDMS sample. We demonstrate a 4.5-fold resolution gain over the diffraction limit.

High resolution in-vivo MR-STAT using a matrix-free and parallelized   reconstruction algorithm,"Oscar van der Heide, Alessandro Sbrizzi, Peter R. Luijten, Cornelis A. T. van den Berg","MR-STAT is a recently proposed framework that allows the reconstruction of multiple quantitative parameter maps from a single short scan by performing spatial localisation and parameter estimation on the time domain data simultaneously, without relying on the FFT. To do this at high-resolution, specialized algorithms are required to solve the underlying large-scale non-linear optimisation problem. We propose a matrix-free and parallelized inexact Gauss-Newton based reconstruction algorithm for this purpose. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a high performance computing cluster and is demonstrated to be able to generate high-resolution ($1mm \times 1mm$ in-plane resolution) quantitative parameter maps in simulation, phantom and in-vivo brain experiments. Reconstructed $T_1$ and $T_2$ values for the gel phantoms are in agreement with results from gold standard measurements and for the in-vivo experiments the quantitative values show good agreement with literature values. In all experiments short pulse sequences with robust Cartesian sampling are used for which conventional MR Fingerprinting reconstructions are shown to fail.",2019-04-30T13:47:15Z,2019-12-16T11:59:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13244v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.13244v2,"physics.med-ph, math.OC"
Effect of quantum nuclear motion on hydrogen bonding,"Ross H. McKenzie, Christiaan Bekker, Bijyalaxmi Athokpam, Sai G. Ramesh","This work considers how the properties of hydrogen bonded complexes, D-H....A, are modified by the quantum motion of the shared proton. Using a simple two-diabatic state model Hamiltonian, the analysis of the symmetric case, where the donor (D) and acceptor (A) have the same proton affinity, is carried out. For quantitative comparisons, a parametrization specific to the O-H....O complexes is used. The vibrational energy levels of the one-dimensional ground state adiabatic potential of the model are used to make quantitative comparisons with a vast body of condensed phase data, spanning a donor-acceptor separation (R) range of about 2.4-3.0 A, i.e., from strong to weak bonds. The position of the proton and its longitudinal vibrational frequency, along with the isotope effects in both are discussed. An analysis of the secondary geometric isotope effects, using a simple extension of the two-state model, yields an improved agreement of the predicted variation with R of frequency isotope effects. The role of the bending modes in also considered: their quantum effects compete with those of the stretching mode for certain ranges of H-bond strengths. In spite of the economy in the parametrization of the model used, it offers key insights into the defining features of H-bonds, and semi-quantitatively captures several experimental trends.",2014-01-15T23:43:21Z,2014-04-22T03:31:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3792v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3792v3,"physics.chem-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Bayesian Optimization for Materials Design with Mixed Quantitative and   Qualitative Variables,"Yichi Zhang, Daniel Apley, Wei Chen","Although Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been employed for accelerating materials design in computational materials engineering, existing works are restricted to problems with quantitative variables. However, real designs of materials systems involve both qualitative and quantitative design variables representing material compositions, microstructure morphology, and processing conditions. For mixed-variable problems, existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) approaches represent qualitative factors by dummy variables first and then fit a standard Gaussian process (GP) model with numerical variables as the surrogate model. This approach is restrictive theoretically and fails to capture complex correlations between qualitative levels. We present in this paper the integration of a novel latent-variable (LV) approach for mixed-variable GP modeling with the BO framework for materials design. LVGP is a fundamentally different approach that maps qualitative design variables to underlying numerical LV in GP, which has strong physical justification. It provides flexible parameterization and representation of qualitative factors and shows superior modeling accuracy compared to the existing methods. We demonstrate our approach through testing with numerical examples and materials design examples. It is found that in all test examples the mapped LVs provide intuitive visualization and substantial insight into the nature and effects of the qualitative factors. Though materials designs are used as examples, the method presented is generic and can be utilized for other mixed variable design optimization problems that involve expensive physics-based simulations.",2019-10-03T19:05:20Z,2019-10-03T19:05:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01688v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01688v1,"stat.ML, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG, stat.AP"

The overall recall and precision rates,from the perspective of one PTB case, were 98.7% and 93.7%, respectively.

Advancing Drug Resistance Research Through Quantitative Modeling and   Synthetic Biology,"K. Farquhar, H. Flohr, D. A. Charlebois","Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging global health crisis that is undermining advances in modern medicine and, if unmitigated, threatens to kill 10 million people per year worldwide by 2050. Research over the last decade has demonstrated that the differences between genetically identical cells in the same environment can lead to drug resistance. Fluctuations in gene expression, modulated by gene regulatory networks, can lead to non-genetic heterogeneity that results in the fractional killing of microbial populations causing drug therapies to fail; this non-genetic drug resistance can enhance the probability of acquiring genetic drug resistance mutations. Mathematical models of gene networks can elucidate general principles underlying drug resistance, predict the evolution of resistance, and guide drug resistance experiments in the laboratory. Cells genetically engineered to carry synthetic gene networks regulating drug resistance genes allow for controlled, quantitative experiments on the role of non-genetic heterogeneity in the development of drug resistance. In this perspective article, we emphasize the contributions that mathematical, computational, and synthetic gene network models play in advancing our understanding of antimicrobial resistance to discover effective therapies against drug-resistant infections.",2020-07-07T03:58:44Z,2020-07-07T03:58:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03186v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03186v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.MN"
"Stability in Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities: flows, regularity   and the entropy method","Matteo Bonforte, Jean Dolbeault, Bruno Nazaret, Nikita Simonov","The purpose of this work is to establish a quantitative and constructive stability result for a class of subcritical Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities which interpolates between the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the standard Sobolev inequality (in dimension larger than three), or Onofri's inequality in dimension two. We develop a new strategy, in which the flow of the fast diffusion equation is used as a tool: a stability result in the inequality is equivalent to an improved rate of convergence to equilibrium for the flow. The regularity properties of the parabolic flow allow us to connect an improved entropy - entropy production inequality during an initial time layer to spectral properties of a suitable linearized problem which is relevant for the asymptotic time layer. Altogether, the stability in the inequalities is measured by a deficit which controls in strong norms (a Fisher information which can be interpreted as a generalized Heisenberg uncertainty principle) the distance to the manifold of optimal functions. The method is constructive and, for the first time, quantitative estimates of the stability constant are obtained, including in the critical case of Sobolev's inequality. To build the estimates, we establish a quantitative global Harnack principle and perform a detailed analysis of large time asymptotics by entropy methods.",2020-07-01T19:29:57Z,2025-02-06T11:45:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03674v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03674v4,"math.AP, 26D10, 46E35, 35K55, 49J40, 35B40, 49K20, 49K30, 35J20"
Machine Learning aided k-t SENSE for fast reconstruction of highly   accelerated PCMR data,"Grzegorz Tomasz Kowalik, Javier Montalt-Tordera, Jennifer Steeden, Vivek Muthurangu","Purpose: We implemented the Machine Learning (ML) aided k-t SENSE reconstruction to enable high resolution quantitative real-time phase contrast MR (PCMR). Methods: A residual U-net and our U-net M were used to generate the high resolution x-f space estimate for k-t SENSE regularisation prior. The networks were judged on their ability to generalise to real undersampled data. The in-vivo validation was done on 20 real-time 18x prospectively undersmapled GASperturbed PCMR data. The ML aided k-t SENSE reconstruction results were compared against the free-breathing Cartesian retrospectively gated sequence and the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction of the same data. Results: In general, the ML aided k-t SENSE generated flow curves that were visually sharper than those produced using CS. In two exceptional cases, U-net M predictions exhibited blurring which propagated to the extracted velocity curves. However, there were no statistical differences in the measured peak velocities and stroke volumes between the tested methods. The ML aided k-t SENSE was estimated to be ~3.6x faster in processing than CS. Conclusion: The ML aided k-t SENSE reconstruction enables artefact suppression on a par with CS with no significant differences in quantitative measures.

Probabilistic Model Checking for Energy Analysis in Software Product   Lines,"Clemens Dubslaff, Sascha Klüppelholz, Christel Baier","In a software product line (SPL), a collection of software products is defined by their commonalities in terms of features rather than explicitly specifying all products one-by-one. Several verification techniques were adapted to establish temporal properties of SPLs. Symbolic and family-based model checking have been proven to be successful for tackling the combinatorial blow-up arising when reasoning about several feature combinations. However, most formal verification approaches for SPLs presented in the literature focus on the static SPLs, where the features of a product are fixed and cannot be changed during runtime. This is in contrast to dynamic SPLs, allowing to adapt feature combinations of a product dynamically after deployment. The main contribution of the paper is a compositional modeling framework for dynamic SPLs, which supports probabilistic and nondeterministic choices and allows for quantitative analysis. We specify the feature changes during runtime within an automata-based coordination component, enabling to reason over strategies how to trigger dynamic feature changes for optimizing various quantitative objectives, e.g., energy or monetary costs and reliability. For our framework there is a natural and conceptually simple translation into the input language of the prominent probabilistic model checker PRISM. This facilitates the application of PRISM's powerful symbolic engine to the operational behavior of dynamic SPLs and their family-based analysis against various quantitative queries.

Scaling behavior of columnar structure during physical vapor deposition,"William J. Meese, Toh-Ming Lu","The statistical effects of different conditions in physical vapor deposition, such as sputter deposition, have on thin film morphology has long been the subject of interest. One notable effect is that of column development due to differential chamber pressure in the well-known empirical model called Thornton's Structure Zone Model. The model is qualitative in nature and theoretical understanding with quantitative predictions of the morphology is still lacking due to, in part, the absence of a quantitative description of the incident flux distribution on the growth front. In this work, we propose an incident Gaussian flux model developed from a series of binary hard-sphere collisions and simulate its effects using Monte Carlo methods and a solid-on-solid growth scheme. We also propose an approximate cosine-power distribution for faster Monte Carlo sampling. With this model, it is observed that higher chamber pressures widen the average deposition angle, and similarly increase the growth of column diameters (or lateral correlation length) and the column-to-column separation (film surface wavelength). We treat both the column diameter and the surface wavelength as power laws. It is seen that both the column diameter exponent and the wavelength exponent are very sensitive to changes in pressure for low pressures (0.13 Pa to 0.80 Pa); meanwhile both exponents saturate for higher pressures (0.80 Pa to 6.7 Pa) around a value of 0.6. These predictions will serve as guides to future experiments for quantitative description of film morphology under a wide range of vapor pressure.",2017-11-06T20:22:02Z,2018-02-23T13:26:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02158v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02158v2,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.comp-ph"
Resetting Piezoresponse Force Microscopy: Towards a real quantitative   technique,"A. Gomez, H. T. T Nong, S. Mercone, T. Puig, X. Obradors","A nanometric needle sensor mounted in an Atomic Force Microscopy allows systematic picometer-range distance measurements. This force sensing device is used in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) as a distance sensor, by employing the cantilever spring constant as the conversion factor opening a pathway to explore the piezoelectric effect at the nanoscale. The force-distance equivalence is achieved if the force sensor does not disturb the system to study, solely. In this manuscript we report a systematic study in which different Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) materials, having different d33 values, are measured following the standard theory available for PFM. Both in resonance and out of resonance measurements demonstrate that PFM cannot be considered quantitative. After performing the measurements, we propose a correction of the standard theory employed in PFM by considering the force exerted by the material as a variable. The g33 parameter, inherent to piezoelectricity, governs the amount of force available from the system. A comparison of piezoelectric stiffness for the case of a nanoscale site contact region, similar to the one it is found while performing PFM, is provided. Such stiffness is well below the cantilever stiffness, limiting and diminishing the material movement, as the piezoelectric material does not have enough stroke to induce the intended displacement. A correction factor, named Open Piezopotential Gauge, accounts for these effects, which is used to correct the measurements carried out in PZT materials towards a real quantitative PFM.",2017-11-30T08:07:33Z,2017-11-30T08:07:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11262v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11262v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.ins-det"
Supervised machine learning based multi-task artificial intelligence   classification of retinopathies,"Minhaj Alam, David Le, Jennifer I. Lim, R. V. P.

Rural and underserved areas, which suffer from lack of access to experienced ophthalmologists may particularly benefit from this technology. Quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging provides excellent capability to identify subtle vascular distortions, which are useful for classifying retinovascular diseases. However, application of AI for differentiation and classification of multiple eye diseases is not yet established. In this study, we demonstrate supervised machine learning based multi-task OCTA classification. We sought 1) to differentiate normal from diseased ocular conditions, 2) to differentiate different ocular disease conditions from each other, and 3) to stage the severity of each ocular condition. Quantitative OCTA features, including blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vascular caliber (BVC), vessel perimeter index (VPI), blood vessel density (BVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (FAZ-A), and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) were fully automatically extracted from the OCTA images. A stepwise backward elimination approach was employed to identify sensitive OCTA features and optimal-feature-combinations for the multi-task classification. For proof-of-concept demonstration, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) were used to validate the supervised machine leaning classifier.

Novel Hierarchical Correlation Functions for Quantitative Representation   of Complex Heterogeneous Materials and Microstructural Evolution,"Pei-En Chen, Wenxiang Xu, Nikhilesh Chawla, Yi Ren, and Yang Jiao","Effective and accurate characterization and quantification of complex microstructure of a heterogeneous material and its evolution under external stimuli are very challenging, yet crucial to achieving reliable material performance prediction, processing optimization and advanced material design. Here, we address this challenge by developing a set of novel hierarchical statistical microstructural descriptors, which we call the ""n-point polytope functions"" Pn, for quantitative characterization, representation and modeling of complex material microstructure and its evolution. These novel polytope functions successively include higher-order n-point statistics of the features of interest in the microstructure in a concise, expressive, explainable, and universal manner; and can be directly computed from multi-modal imaging data. We develop highly efficient computational tools to directly extract the Pn functions up to n = 8 from multi-modal imaging data. Using simple model microstructures, we show that these novel statistical descriptors effectively ""decompose"" the structural features of interest into a set of ""polytope basis"", allowing one to easily detect any underlying symmetry or emerging features during the structural evolution. We apply these novel Pn functions to quantify and model a variety of heterogeneous material systems, including particle-reinforced composites, metal-ceramic composites, concretes, porous materials; as well as the microstructural evolution in an aged lead-tin alloy.

Quantitative Error Prediction of Medical Image Registration using   Regression Forests,"Hessam Sokooti, Gorkem Saygili, Ben Glocker, Boudewijn P. F.

In addition, quantitative error prediction can be helpful in improving the registration quality. The task of predicting registration error is demanding due to the lack of a ground truth in medical images. This paper proposes a new automatic method to predict the registration error in a quantitative manner, and is applied to chest CT scans. A random regression forest is utilized to predict the registration error locally. The forest is built with features related to the transformation model and features related to the dissimilarity after registration. The forest is trained and tested using manually annotated corresponding points between pairs of chest CT scans in two experiments: SPREAD (trained and tested on SPREAD) and inter-database (including three databases SPREAD, DIR-Lab-4DCT and DIR-Lab-COPDgene). The results show that the mean absolute errors of regression are 1.07 $\pm$ 1.86 and 1.76 $\pm$ 2.59 mm for the SPREAD and inter-database experiment, respectively. The overall accuracy of classification in three classes (correct, poor and wrong registration) is 90.7% and 75.4%, for SPREAD and inter-database respectively.

Decoding the Rejuvenating Effects of Mechanical Loading on Skeletal   Maturation using in Vivo Imaging and Deep Learning,"Pouyan Asgharzadeh, Oliver Röhrle, Bettina M. Willie, Annette I.

To date, precise contributions of age-related changes in bone (re)modeling and (de)mineralization dynamics and its effect on the loss of functional integrity are not completely understood. Here, we present an image-based deep learning approach to quantitatively describe the dynamic effects of short-term aging and adaptive response to treatment in proximal mouse tibia and fibula. Our approach allowed us to perform an end-to-end age prediction based on $\mu$CT images to determine the dynamic biological process of tissue maturation during a two week period, therefore permitting a short-term bone aging prediction with $95\%$ accuracy. In a second application, our radiomics analysis reveals that two weeks of in vivo mechanical loading are associated with an underlying rejuvenating effect of 5 days. Additionally, by quantitatively analyzing the learning process, we could, for the first time, identify the localization of the age-relevant encoded information and demonstrate $89\%$ load-induced similarity of these locations in the loaded tibia with younger bones. These data suggest that our method enables identifying a general prognostic phenotype of a certain bone age as well as a temporal and localized loading-treatment effect on this apparent bone age.

Latent Map Gaussian Processes for Mixed Variable Metamodeling,"Nicholas Oune, Ramin Bostanabad","Gaussian processes (GPs) are ubiquitously used in sciences and engineering as metamodels. Standard GPs, however, can only handle numerical or quantitative variables. In this paper, we introduce latent map Gaussian processes (LMGPs) that inherit the attractive properties of GPs and are also applicable to mixed data which have both quantitative and qualitative inputs. The core idea behind LMGPs is to learn a continuous, low-dimensional latent space or manifold which encodes all qualitative inputs. To learn this manifold, we first assign a unique prior vector representation to each combination of qualitative inputs. We then use a low-rank linear map to project these priors on a manifold that characterizes the posterior representations. As the posteriors are quantitative, they can be directly used in any standard correlation function such as the Gaussian or Matern. Hence, the optimal map and the corresponding manifold, along with other hyperparameters of the correlation function, can be systematically learned via maximum likelihood estimation. Through a wide range of analytic and real-world examples, we demonstrate the advantages of LMGPs over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and versatility. In particular, we show that LMGPs can handle variable-length inputs, have an explainable neural network interpretation, and provide insights into how qualitative inputs affect the response or interact with each other. We also employ LMGPs in Bayesian optimization and illustrate that they can discover optimal compound compositions more efficiently than conventional methods that convert compositions to qualitative variables via manual featurization.",2021-02-07T22:21:53Z,2021-04-26T19:20:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03935v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03935v2,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.AP, I.2.6"
Quantitative estimates for parabolic optimal control problems under   $L^\infty$ and $L^1$ constraints in the ball:Quantifying parabolic   isoperimetric inequalities,Idriss Mazari,"In this article, we present two different approaches for obtaining quantitative inequalities in the context of parabolic optimal control problems. Our model consists of a linearly controlled heat equation with Dirichlet boundary condition $(u_f)_t-\Delta u_f=f$, $f$ being the control. We seek to maximise the functional $\mathcal J_T(f):=\frac12\int_{(0;T)\times \Omega} u_f^2$ or, for some $\epsilon>0$, $\mathcal J_T^\epsilon (f):=\frac12\int_{(0;T)\times \Omega} u_f^2+\epsilon \int_\Omega u_f^2(T,\cdot)$ and to obtain quantitative estimates for these maximisation problems. We offer two approaches in the case where the domain $\Omega$ is a ball. In that case, if $f$ satisfies $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ constraints and does not depend on time, we propose a shape derivative approach that shows that, for any competitor $f=f(x)$ satisfying the same constraints, we have $\mathcal J_T(f^*)-\mathcal J_T(f)\gtrsim \Vert f-f^*\Vert_{L^1(\Omega)}^2$, $f^*$ being the maximiser. Through our proof of this time-independent case, we also show how to obtain coercivity norms for shape hessians in such parabolic optimisation problems. We also consider the case where $f=f(t,x)$ satisfies a global $L^\infty$ constraint and, for every $t\in (0;T)$, an $L^1$ constraint. In this case, assuming $\epsilon>0$, we prove an estimate of the form $\mathcal J_T^\epsilon (f^*)-\mathcal J_T^\epsilon (f)\gtrsim\int_0^T a_\epsilon (t) \Vert f(t,\cdot)-f^*(t,\cdot)\Vert_{L^1(\Omega)}^2$ where $a_\epsilon (t)>0$ for any $t\in (0;T)$.

A Framework for Quantitative Analysis of Cascades on Networks,"Rumi Ghosh, Kristina Lerman","How does information flow in online social networks? How does the structure and size of the information cascade evolve in time? How can we efficiently mine the information contained in cascade dynamics? We approach these questions empirically and present an efficient and scalable mathematical framework for quantitative analysis of cascades on networks. We define a cascade generating function that captures the details of the microscopic dynamics of the cascades. We show that this function can also be used to compute the macroscopic properties of cascades, such as their size, spread, diameter, number of paths, and average path length. We present an algorithm to efficiently compute cascade generating function and demonstrate that while significantly compressing information within a cascade, it nevertheless allows us to accurately reconstruct its structure. We use this framework to study information dynamics on the social network of Digg. Digg allows users to post and vote on stories, and easily see the stories that friends have voted on. As a story spreads on Digg through voting, it generates cascades. We extract cascades of more than 3,500 Digg stories and calculate their macroscopic and microscopic properties. We identify several trends in cascade dynamics: spreading via chaining, branching and community. We discuss how these affect the spread of the story through the Digg social network.

The effects of grain symmetry, grain size, and alloying elements on the dispersion and attenuation behaviors are examined. Key information is obtained which has significant implications for quantitatively evaluating the average grain size, monitoring the phase transition, and even estimating gradual change in chemical composition of titanium components in gas turbine engines. For applications in seismology, the velocities and Q-factors for both hexagonal and cubic polycrystalline iron models for the Earth uppermost inner core are obtained in the whole frequency range. This work provides a universal, quantitative model for characterization of a large variety of polycrystalline materials. It also can be extended to incorporate more complicated microstructures, including ellipsoidal grains with or without textures, and even multiphase polycrystalline materials. The new model demonstrates great potential of applications in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation and inspection of aerospace and aeronautic structures. It also provides a theoretical framework for quantitative seismic data explanation and inversion for the material composition and structural formations of the Earth inner core.",2017-10-10T21:27:12Z,2017-10-10T21:27:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03828v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03828v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.geo-ph"
Model-based Learning for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping,"Juan Liu, Kevin M. Koch","Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that estimates magnetic susceptibility of tissue from Larmor frequency offset measurements. The generation of QSM requires solving a challenging ill-posed field-to-source inversion problem. Inaccurate field-to-source inversion often causes large susceptibility estimation errors that appear as streaking artifacts in the QSM, especially in massive hemorrhagic regions. Recently, several deep learning (DL) QSM techniques have been proposed and demonstrated impressive performance. Due to the inherent non-existent ground-truth QSM references, these DL techniques used either calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling (COSMOS) maps or synthetic data for network training. Therefore, they were constrained by the availability and accuracy of COSMOS maps, or suffered from performance drop when the training and testing domains were different. To address these limitations, we present a model-based DL method, denoted as uQSM. Without accessing to QSM labels, uQSM is trained using the well-established physical model. When evaluating on multi-orientation QSM datasets, uQSM achieves higher levels of quantitative accuracy compared to TKD, TV-FANSI, MEDI, and DIP approaches. When qualitatively evaluated on single-orientation datasets, uQSM outperforms other methods and reconstructed high quality QSM.",2020-04-14T01:30:31Z,2020-08-17T04:03:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06259v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06259v3,"physics.med-ph, eess.IV"
Modeling Institutional Credit Risk with Financial News,Tam Tran-The,"Credit risk management, the practice of mitigating losses by understanding the adequacy of a borrower's capital and loan loss reserves, has long been imperative to any financial institution's long-term sustainability and growth. MassMutual is no exception. The company is keen on effectively monitoring downgrade risk, or the risk associated with the event when credit rating of a company deteriorates. Current work in downgrade risk modeling depends on multiple variations of quantitative measures provided by third-party rating agencies and risk management consultancy companies. As these structured numerical data become increasingly commoditized among institutional investors, there has been a wide push into using alternative sources of data, such as financial news, earnings call transcripts, or social media content, to possibly gain a competitive edge in the industry. The volume of qualitative information or unstructured text data has exploded in the past decades and is now available for due diligence to supplement quantitative measures of credit risk. This paper proposes a predictive downgrade model using solely news data represented by neural network embeddings. The model standalone achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of more than 80 percent. The output probability from this news model, as an additional feature, improves the performance of our benchmark model using only quantitative measures by more than 5 percent in terms of both AUC and recall rate. A qualitative evaluation also indicates that news articles related to our predicted downgrade events are specially relevant and high-quality in our business context.",2020-04-14T17:52:07Z,2020-04-14T17:52:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08204v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08204v1,"q-fin.RM, cs.IR, cs.SI"
Normative theory of patch foraging decisions,"Zachary P Kilpatrick, Jacob D Davidson, Ahmed El Hady","Foraging is a fundamental behavior as animals' search for food is crucial for their survival. Patch leaving is a canonical foraging behavior, but classic theoretical conceptions of patch leaving decisions lack some key naturalistic details. Optimal foraging theory provides general rules for when an animal should leave a patch, but does not provide mechanistic insights about how those rules change with the structure of the environment. Such a mechanistic framework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral and neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop a normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we treat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the animals' optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting environments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using methods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in terms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an animal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in which the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The quantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from analyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of quantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging theory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments investigating patch foraging behavior.",2020-04-22T16:09:04Z,2020-04-22T16:09:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10671v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10671v1,"q-bio.NC, math.PR"
A Phase Transition in Arrow's Theorem,"Frederic Koehler, Elchanan Mossel","Arrow's Theorem concerns a fundamental problem in social choice theory: given the individual preferences of members of a group, how can they be aggregated to form rational group preferences? Arrow showed that in an election between three or more candidates, there are situations where any voting rule satisfying a small list of natural ""fairness"" axioms must produce an apparently irrational intransitive outcome. Furthermore, quantitative versions of Arrow's Theorem in the literature show that when voters choose rankings in an i.i.d.\ fashion, the outcome is intransitive with non-negligible probability.   It is natural to ask if such a quantitative version of Arrow's Theorem holds for non-i.i.d.\ models. To answer this question, we study Arrow's Theorem under a natural non-i.i.d.\ model of voters inspired by canonical models in statistical physics; indeed, a version of this model was previously introduced by Raffaelli and Marsili in the physics literature. This model has a parameter, temperature, that prescribes the correlation between different voters. We show that the behavior of Arrow's Theorem in this model undergoes a striking phase transition: in the entire high temperature regime of the model, a Quantitative Arrow's Theorem holds showing that the probability of paradox for any voting rule satisfying the axioms is non-negligible; this is tight because the probability of paradox under pairwise majority goes to zero when approaching the critical temperature, and becomes exponentially small in the number of voters beyond it. We prove this occurs in another natural model of correlated voters and conjecture this phenomena is quite general.",2020-04-27T04:41:03Z,2021-09-24T05:23:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12580v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12580v3,"math.PR, cs.DM, cs.GT, math.CO"
Quantifying and mapping covalent bond scission during elastomer fracture,"Juliette Slootman, Victoria Waltz, C. Joshua Yeh, Christoph Baumann, Robert Göst, Jean Comtet, Costantino Creton","Many new soft but tough rubbery materials have been recently discovered and new applications such as flexible prosthetics, stretchable electrodes or soft robotics continuously emerge. Yet, a credible multi-scale quantitative picture of damage and fracture of these materials has still not emerged, due to our fundamental inability to disentangle the irreversible scission of chemical bonds along the fracture path from dissipation by internal molecular friction. Here, by coupling new fluorogenic mechanochemistry with quantitative confocal microscopy mapping, we uncover how many and where covalent bonds are broken as an elastomer fractures. Our measurements reveal that bond scission near the crack plane can be delocalized over up to hundreds of micrometers and increase by a factor of 100 depending on temperature and stretch rate, pointing to an intricated coupling between strain rate dependent viscous dissipation and strain dependent irreversible network scission. These findings paint an entirely novel picture of fracture in soft materials, where energy dissipated by covalent bond scission accounts for a much larger fraction of the total fracture energy than previously believed. Our results pioneer the sensitive, quantitative and spatially-resolved detection of bond scission to assess material damage in a variety of soft materials and their applications.",2020-06-16T19:21:14Z,2020-06-16T19:21:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09468v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09468v1,"cond-mat.soft, physics.chem-ph"
Multiatlas Calibration of Biophysical Brain Tumor Growth Models with   Mass Effect,"Shashank Subramanian, Klaudius Scheufele, Naveen Himthani, George Biros","We present a 3D fully-automatic method for the calibration of partial differential equation (PDE) models of glioblastoma (GBM) growth with mass effect, the deformation of brain tissue due to the tumor. We quantify the mass effect, tumor proliferation, tumor migration, and the localized tumor initial condition from a single multiparameteric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) patient scan. The PDE is a reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation coupled with linear elasticity equations to capture mass effect. The single-scan calibration model is notoriously difficult because the precancerous (healthy) brain anatomy is unknown. To solve this inherently ill-posed and ill-conditioned optimization problem, we introduce a novel inversion scheme that uses multiple brain atlases as proxies for the healthy precancer patient brain resulting in robust and reliable parameter estimation. We apply our method on both synthetic and clinical datasets representative of the heterogeneous spatial landscape typically observed in glioblastomas to demonstrate the validity and performance of our methods. In the synthetic data, we report calibration errors (due to the ill-posedness and our solution scheme) in the 10\%-20\% range. In the clinical data, we report good quantitative agreement with the observed tumor and qualitative agreement with the mass effect (for which we do not have a ground truth). Our method uses a minimal set of parameters and provides both global and local quantitative measures of tumor infiltration and mass effect.",2020-06-17T15:24:05Z,2020-06-17T15:24:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09932v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09932v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.CE, physics.med-ph"
Quantitative Statistical Robustness for Tail-Dependent Law Invariant   Risk Measures,"Wei Wang, Huifu Xu, Tiejun Ma","When estimating the risk of a financial position with empirical data or Monte Carlo simulations via a tail-dependent law invariant risk measure such as the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), it is important to ensure the robustness of the statistical estimator particularly when the data contain noise. Kratscher et al. [1] propose a new framework to examine the qualitative robustness of estimators for tail-dependent law invariant risk measures on Orlicz spaces, which is a step further from earlier work for studying the robustness of risk measurement procedures by Cont et al. [2]. In this paper, we follow the stream of research to propose a quantitative approach for verifying the statistical robustness of tail-dependent law invariant risk measures. A distinct feature of our approach is that we use the Fortet-Mourier metric to quantify the variation of the true underlying probability measure in the analysis of the discrepancy between the laws of the plug-in estimators of law invariant risk measure based on the true data and perturbed data, which enables us to derive an explicit error bound for the discrepancy when the risk functional is Lipschitz continuous with respect to a class of admissible laws. Moreover, the newly introduced notion of Lipschitz continuity allows us to examine the degree of robustness for tail-dependent risk measures. Finally, we apply our quantitative approach to some well-known risk measures to illustrate our theory.",2020-06-28T02:52:32Z,2020-06-28T02:52:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15491v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15491v1,"q-fin.RM, econ.EM, math.PR"
Utilizing Treewidth for Quantitative Reasoning on Epistemic Logic   Programs,"Viktor Besin, Markus Hecher, Stefan Woltran","Extending the popular Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm by introspective reasoning capacities has received increasing interest within the last years. Particular attention is given to the formalism of epistemic logic programs (ELPs) where standard rules are equipped with modal operators which allow to express conditions on literals for being known or possible, i.e., contained in all or some answer sets, respectively. ELPs thus deliver multiple collections of answer sets, known as world views. Employing ELPs for reasoning problems so far has mainly been restricted to standard decision problems (complexity analysis) and enumeration (development of systems) of world views. In this paper, we take a next step and contribute to epistemic logic programming in two ways: First, we establish quantitative reasoning for ELPs, where the acceptance of a certain set of literals depends on the number (proportion) of world views that are compatible with the set. Second, we present a novel system that is capable of efficiently solving the underlying counting problems required to answer such quantitative reasoning problems. Our system exploits the graph-based measure treewidth and works by iteratively finding and refining (graph) abstractions of an ELP program. On top of these abstractions, we apply dynamic programming that is combined with utilizing existing search-based solvers like (e)clingo for hard combinatorial subproblems that appear during solving. It turns out that our approach is competitive with existing systems that were introduced recently. This work is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.",2021-08-06T09:46:34Z,2021-08-06T09:46:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03022v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03022v1,"cs.AI, cs.CC, cs.DS, cs.LO, math.LO"
Reproducibility and Evolution of Diffusion MRI Measurements within the   Cervical Spinal Cord in Multiple Sclerosis,"Haykel Snoussi, Emmanuel Caruyer, Benoit Combes, Olivier Commowick, Elise Bannier, Anne Kerbrat, Julien Cohen-Adad, Christian Barillot","In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is a large discrepancy between the clinical observations and how the pathology is exhibited on brain images, this is known as the clinical-radiological paradox (CRP). One of the hypotheses is that the clinical deficit may be more related to the spinal cord damage than the number or location of lesions in the brain. Therefore, investigating how the spinal cord is damaged becomes an acute challenge to better understand and overcome the CRP. Diffusion MRI is known to provide quantitative figures of neuronal degeneration and axonal loss, in the brain as well as in the spinal cord. In this paper, we propose to investigate how diffusion MRI metrics vary in the different cervical regions with the progression of the disease. We first study the reproducibility of diffusion MRI on healthy volunteers with a test-retest procedure using both standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and multi-compartment Ball-and-Stick models. Then, based on the test re-test quantitative calibration, we provide quantitative figures of pathology evolution between M0 and M12 in the cervical spine on a set of 31 MS patients, exhibiting how the pathology damage spans in the cervical spinal cord.",2021-08-08T06:07:22Z,2021-08-08T06:07:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03575v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03575v1,"eess.IV, physics.med-ph"
A mathematical model for phenotypic heterogeneity in breast cancer with   implications for therapeutic strategies,"Xin Li, D. Thirumalai","Inevitably, almost all cancer patients develop resistance to targeted therapy. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is a major cause of drug resistance. Mathematical models that explain experiments quantitatively is useful in understanding the origin of ITH, which then could be used to explore scenarios for efficacious therapy. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate ITH in breast cancer by exploiting the observation that HER2+ and HER2- cells could divide symmetrically or asymmetrically. Our predictions for the evolution of cell fractions are in quantitative agreement with single-cell experiments. Remarkably, the colony size of HER2+ cells emerging from a single HER2- cell (or vice versa), which occurs in about four cell doublings, agrees perfectly with experimental results, without tweaking any parameter in the model. The theory quantitatively explains experimental data on the responses of breast cancer tumor under different treatment protocols. We then used the model to predict that, not only the order of two drugs, but also the treatment period for each drug and the tumor cell plasticity could be manipulated to improve the treatment efficacy. Mathematical models, when integrated with data on patients, make possible exploration of a broad range of parameters readily, which might provide insights in devising effective therapies.",2021-08-13T06:21:05Z,2021-08-13T06:21:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06079v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06079v1,"cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.PE"
Quantitative near-field characterization of surface plasmon polaritons   on monocrystalline gold platelets,"Laura N. Casses, Korbinian J.

Near-field microscopy associated with interferometric detection allows to visualize both the amplitude and phase of SPPs. However, their full quantitative characterization in a reflection configuration is challenging due to complex wave patterns arising from the interference between several excitation channels. Here, we present near-field measurements of SPPs on large monocrystalline gold platelets in the visible spectral range. We study systematically the influence of the incident angle of the exciting light on the SPPs launched by an atomic force microscope tip. We find that the amplitude and phase signals of these SPPs are best disentangled from other signals at grazing incident angle relative to the edge of the gold platelet. Furthermore, we introduce a simple model to explain the phase shift observed between the SPP amplitude and phase profiles. Using this model, the wavelength and propagation length of the tip-launched plasmons are retrieved by isolating and fitting their signals far from the platelets edges. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with theoretical models using gold refractive index values. The presented method to fully characterize the SPP complex wavevector could enable the quantitative analysis of polaritons occurring in different materials at visible wavelengths.",2022-01-21T14:42:49Z,2022-01-21T14:42:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08725v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08725v1,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mes-hall"
Explicit tracking of uncertainty increases the power of quantitative   rule-of-thumb reasoning in cell biology,"Iain G. Johnston, Benjamin C. Rickett, Nick S. Jones","""Back-of-the-envelope"" or ""rule-of-thumb"" calculations involving rough estimates of quantities play a central scientific role in developing intuition about the structure and behaviour of physical systems, for example in so-called `Fermi problems' in the physical sciences. Such calculations can be used to powerfully and quantitatively reason about biological systems, particularly at the interface between physics and biology. However, substantial uncertainties are often associated with values in cell biology, and performing calculations without taking this uncertainty into account may limit the extent to which results can be interpreted for a given problem. We present a means to facilitate such calculations where uncertainties are explicitly tracked through the line of reasoning, and introduce a `probabilistic calculator' called Caladis, a web tool freely available at www.caladis.org, designed to perform this tracking. This approach allows users to perform more statistically robust calculations in cell biology despite having uncertain values, and to identify which quantities need to be measured more precisely in order to make confident statements, facilitating efficient experimental design. We illustrate the use of our tool for tracking uncertainty in several example biological calculations, showing that the results yield powerful and interpretable statistics on the quantities of interest. We also demonstrate that the outcomes of calculations may differ from point estimates when uncertainty is accurately tracked. An integral link between Caladis and the Bionumbers repository of biological quantities further facilitates the straightforward location, selection, and use of a wealth of experimental data in cell biological calculations.",2014-12-04T09:29:48Z,2014-12-04T09:29:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1597v1,"q-bio.QM, stat.ME"
Quantitative Analysis of the Italian National Scientific Qualification,Moreno Marzolla,"The Italian National Scientific Qualification (ASN) was introduced in 2010 as part of a major reform of the national university system. Under the new regulation, the scientific qualification for a specific role (associate or full professor) and field of study is required to apply to a permanent professor position. The ASN is peculiar since it makes use of bibliometric indicators with associated thresholds as one of the parameters used to assess applicants. Overall, more than 59000 applications were submitted, and the results have been made publicly available for a short period of time, including the values of the quantitative indicators for each applicant. The availability of this wealth of information provides an opportunity to draw a fairly detailed picture of a nation-wide evaluation exercise, and to study the impact of the bibliometric indicators on the qualification results. In this paper we provide a first account of the Italian ASN from a quantitative point of view. We show that significant differences exist among scientific disciplines, in particular with respect to the fraction of qualified applicants, that can not be easily explained. Furthermore, we describe some issues related to the definition and use of the bibliometric indicators and thresholds.

"Quantitative convergence analysis of iterated expansive, set-valued   mappings","D. Russell Luke, Nguyen H. Thao, Matthew K.

The first is a natural generalization of single-valued averaged mappings to expansive, set-valued mappings that characterizes a type of strong calmness of the fixed point mapping. The second component to this analysis is an extension of the well-established notion of metric subregularity -- or inverse calmness -- of the mapping at fixed points. Convergence of expansive fixed point iterations is proved using these two properties, and quantitative estimates are a natural byproduct of the framework. To demonstrate the application of the theory, we prove for the first time a number of results showing local linear convergence of nonconvex cyclic projections for inconsistent (and consistent) feasibility problems, local linear convergence of the forward-backward algorithm for structured optimization without convexity, strong or otherwise, and local linear convergence of the Douglas--Rachford algorithm for structured nonconvex minimization.

Our work extends the framework of [BFRR14] and follow-up papers, which focused on quantitative objectives, by addressing the case of $\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, a natural way to represent functional requirements of systems.   We build strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while ensuring a secondary one with sufficient probability. This setting raises new challenges in comparison to quantitative objectives, as one cannot easily mix different strategies without endangering the functional properties of the system. We establish that, for all variants of this problem, deciding the existence of a strategy lies in ${\sf NP} \cap {\sf coNP}$, the same complexity class as classical parity games.

Quantitative Susceptibility Map Reconstruction Using Annihilating   Filter-based Low-Rank Hankel Matrix Approach,"Hyun-Seo Ahn, Sung-Hong Park, Jong Chul Ye","Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) inevitably suffers from streaking artifacts caused by zeros on the conical surface of the dipole kernel in k-space. This work proposes a novel and accurate QSM reconstruction method based on a direct k-space interpolation approach, avoiding problems of over smoothing and streaking artifacts. Inspired by the recent theory of annihilating filter-based low-rank Hankel matrix approach (ALOHA), QSM reconstruction problem is formulated as deconvolution problem under low-rank Hankel matrix constraint in the k-space. To reduce the computational complexity and the memory requirement, the problem is formulated as successive reconstruction of 2-D planes along three independent axes of the 3-D phase image in Fourier domain. Extensive experiments were performed to verify and compare the proposed method with existing QSM reconstruction methods. The proposed ALOHA-QSM effectively reduced streaking artifacts and accurately estimated susceptibility values in deep gray matter structures, compared to the existing QSM methods. Our suggested ALOHA-QSM algorithm successfully solves the three-dimensional QSM dipole inversion problem without additional anatomical information or prior assumption and provides good image quality and quantitative accuracy.",2018-04-25T07:22:48Z,2019-08-09T06:59:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09396v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09396v2,"cs.CV, eess.SP, physics.med-ph"
Optimal illumination pattern for transport-of-intensity quantitative   phase microscopy,"Jiaji Li, Qian Chen, Jiasong Sun, Jialin Zhang, Xiangpeng Pan, Chao Zuo","The transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) is a well-established non-interferometric phase retrieval approach, which enables quantitative phase imaging (QPI) of transparent sample simply by measuring the intensities at multiple axially displaced planes. Nevertheless, it still suffers from two fundamentally limitations. First, it is quite susceptible to low-frequency errors (such as \cloudy"" artifacts), which results from the poor contrast of the phase transfer function (PTF) near the zero frequency. Second, the reconstructed phase tends to blur under spatially low-coherent illumination, especially when the defocus distance is beyond the near Fresnel region. Recent studies have shown that the shape of the illumination aperture has a significant impact on the resolution and phase reconstruction quality, and by simply replacing the conventional circular illumination aperture with an annular one, these two limitations can be addressed, or at least significantly alleviated. However, the annular aperture was previously empirically designed based on intuitive criteria related to the shape of PTF, which does not guarantee optimality. In this work, we optimize the illumination pattern to maximize TIE's performance based on a combined quantitative criterion for evaluating the \goodness"" of an aperture. In order to make the size of the solution search space tractable, we restrict our attention to binary coded axis-symmetric illumination patterns only, which are easier to implement and can generate isotropic TIE PTFs. We test the obtained optimal illumination by imaging both a phase resolution target and HeLa cells based on a small-pitch LED array, suggesting superior performance over other suboptimal patterns in terms of both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution.",2018-08-20T09:09:03Z,2018-08-20T09:09:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06353v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06353v1,"eess.IV, physics.optics"

In considering this demand, a simple and new method of analyzing and classifying the normal mode vibrational motions of molecular systems was introduced [4]. This approach is a fully quantitative method of analysis of normal mode displacement vector matrices and classification of the characteristic frequencies (fundamentals) underlying the observed IR bands. Outcomes of applying such an approach show some overlap with customary empirical classifications, usually at short wavelengths. It provides a quantitative breakdown of a complex vibration (at longer wavelengths) into the contributed fragments like their aromatic or aliphatic components. In addition, in molecular systems outside the classical models of chemical bonds and structures where the empirical approach cannot be applied, this quantitative method enables an interpretation of vibrational motion(s) underlying the IR bands.",2018-11-21T02:11:13Z,2018-11-21T02:11:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08547v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08547v1,"astro-ph.GA, physics.chem-ph"
"Share, but unequally: A plausible mechanism for emergence and   maintenance of intratumor heterogeneity","Xin Li, D. Thirumalai","Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), referring to coexistence of different cell subpopulations in a single tumor, has been a major puzzle in cancer research for almost half a century. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanism of ITH hinders progress in developing effective therapies for cancers. Based on the findings in a recent quantitative experiment on pancreatic cancer, we developed a general evolutionary model for one type of cancer, accounting for interactions between different cell populations through paracrine or juxtacrine factors. We show that the emergence of a stable heterogeneous state in a tumor requires an unequal allocation of paracrine growth factors (""public goods"") between cells that produce them and those that merely consume them. Our model provides a quantitative explanation of recent {\it in vitro} experimental studies in pancreatic cancer in which insulin growth factor (IGF-II) plays the role of public goods. The calculated phase diagrams as a function of exogenous resources and fraction of growth factor producing cells show ITH persists only in a narrow range of concentration of exogenous IGF-II. Remarkably, maintenance of ITH requires cooperation among tumor cell subpopulations in harsh conditions, specified by lack of exogenous IGF-II, whereas surplus exogenous IGF-II elicits competition. Our theory also quantitatively accounts for measured {\it in vivo} tumor growth in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The predictions for GBM tumor growth as a function of the fraction of tumor cells are amenable to experimental tests. The mechanism for ITH also provides hints for devising efficacious therapies.",2018-11-29T23:39:49Z,2018-11-29T23:39:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12537v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12537v1,"q-bio.PE, cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph"

Recent studies in radiomics aim to investigate the relationship between tumors imaging features and clinical outcomes. Open source radiomics feature banks enable the extraction and analysis of thousands of predefined features. On the other hand, recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in the quantitative medical imaging field, raising the research question of whether predefined radiomics features have predictive information in addition to deep learning features. In this study, we propose a feature fusion method and investigate whether a combined feature bank of deep learning and predefined radiomics features can improve the prognostics performance. CT images from resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients were used to compare the prognosis performance of common feature reduction and fusion methods and the proposed risk-score based feature fusion method for overall survival. It was shown that the proposed feature fusion method significantly improves the prognosis performance for overall survival in resectable PDAC cohorts, elevating the area under ROC curve by 51% compared to predefined radiomics features alone, by 16% compared to deep learning features alone, and by 32% compared to existing feature fusion and reduction methods for a combination of deep learning and predefined radiomics features.",2019-07-10T16:43:50Z,2019-07-10T16:43:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04822v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04822v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.CV, eess.IV"
Harmonic measure and quantitative connectivity: geometric   characterization of the $L^p$-solvability of the Dirichlet problem,"Jonas Azzam, Steve Hofmann, José María Martell, Mihalis Mourgoglou, Xavier Tolsa","It is well-known that quantitative, scale invariant absolute continuity (more precisely, the weak-$A_\infty$ property) of harmonic measure with respect to surface measure, on the boundary of an open set $ \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with Ahlfors-David regular boundary, is equivalent to the solvability of the Dirichlet problem in $\Omega$, with data in $L^p(\partial\Omega)$ for some $p<\infty$. In this paper, we give a geometric characterization of the weak-$A_\infty$ property, of harmonic measure, and hence of solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for some finite $p$. This characterization is obtained under background hypotheses (an interior corkscrew condition, along with Ahlfors-David regularity of the boundary) that are natural, and in a certain sense optimal: we provide counter-examples in the absence of either of them (or even one of the two, upper or lower, Ahlfors-David bounds); moreover, the examples show that the upper and lower Ahlfors-David bounds are each quantitatively sharp.",2019-07-04T17:23:54Z,2020-06-15T04:49:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07102v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07102v2,"math.CA, math.AP, 31B05, 35J25, 42B25, 42B37"
Effective bilipschitz bounds on drilling and filling,"David Futer, Jessica S. Purcell, Saul Schleimer","This paper proves explicit bilipschitz bounds on the change in metric between the thick part of a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold N and the thick part of any of its long Dehn fillings. Given a bilipschitz constant J > 1 and a thickness constant epsilon > 0, we quantify how long a Dehn filling suffices to guarantee a J-bilipschitz map on epsilon-thick parts. A similar theorem without quantitative control was previously proved by Brock and Bromberg, applying Hodgson and Kerckhoff's theory of cone deformations. We achieve quantitative control by bounding the analytic quantities that control the infinitesimal change in metric during the cone deformation.   Our quantitative results have two immediate applications. First, we relate the Margulis number of N to the Margulis numbers of its Dehn fillings. In particular, we give a lower bound on the systole of any closed 3-manifold M whose Margulis number is less than 0.29. Combined with Shalen's upper bound on the volume of such a manifold, this gives a procedure to compute the finite list of 3-manifolds whose Margulis numbers are below 0.29.   Our second application is to the cosmetic surgery conjecture. Given the systole of a one-cusped hyperbolic manifold N, we produce an explicit upper bound on the length of a slope involved in a cosmetic surgery on N. This reduces the cosmetic surgery conjecture on N to an explicit finite search.",2019-07-31T13:47:39Z,2022-08-04T12:54:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13502v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13502v4,"math.GT, math.DG, 57M50, 30F40, 57M25"

DistNet: Deep Tracking by displacement regression: application to   bacteria growing in the Mother Machine,"Jean Ollion, Charles Ollion","The mother machine is a popular microfluidic device that allows long-term time-lapse imaging of thousands of cells in parallel by microscopy. It has become a valuable tool for single-cell level quantitative analysis and characterization of many cellular processes such as gene expression and regulation, mutagenesis or response to antibiotics. The automated and quantitative analysis of the massive amount of data generated by such experiments is now the limiting step. In particular the segmentation and tracking of bacteria cells imaged in phase-contrast microscopy---with error rates compatible with high-throughput data---is a challenging problem.   In this work, we describe a novel formulation of the multi-object tracking problem, in which tracking is performed by a regression of the bacteria's displacement, allowing simultaneous tracking of multiple bacteria, despite their growth and division over time. Our method performs jointly segmentation and tracking, leveraging sequential information to increase segmentation accuracy.   We introduce a Deep Neural Network architecture taking advantage of a self-attention mechanism which yields extremely low tracking error rate and segmentation error rate. We demonstrate superior performance and speed compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method is named DiSTNet which stands for DISTance+DISplacement Segmentation and Tracking Network.

Introduction to Rare-Event Predictive Modeling for Inferential   Statisticians -- A Hands-On Application in the Prediction of Breakthrough   Patents,"Daniel Hain, Roman Jurowetzki","Recent years have seen a substantial development of quantitative methods, mostly led by the computer science community with the goal of developing better machine learning applications, mainly focused on predictive modeling. However, economic, management, and technology forecasting research has so far been hesitant to apply predictive modeling techniques and workflows. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning (ML) approach to quantitative analysis geared towards optimizing the predictive performance, contrasting it with standard practices inferential statistics, which focus on producing good parameter estimates. We discuss the potential synergies between the two fields against the backdrop of this, at first glance, target-incompatibility. We discuss fundamental concepts in predictive modeling, such as out-of-sample model validation, variable and model selection, generalization, and hyperparameter tuning procedures. We are providing a hands-on predictive modeling introduction for a quantitative social science audience while aiming at demystifying computer science jargon. We use the illustrative example of patent quality estimation - which should be a familiar topic of interest in the Scientometrics community - guiding the reader through various model classes and procedures for data pre-processing, modeling, and validation. We start off with more familiar easy to interpret model classes (Logit and Elastic Nets), continues with less familiar non-parametric approaches (Classification Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees), and finally presents artificial neural network architectures, first a simple feed-forward and then a deep autoencoder geared towards rare-event prediction.",2020-03-30T13:06:25Z,2021-03-01T14:36:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13441v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13441v2,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
Automated Segmentation of Brain Gray Matter Nuclei on Quantitative   Susceptibility Mapping Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"Chao Chai, Pengchong Qiao, Bin Zhao, Huiying Wang, Guohua Liu, Hong Wu, E Mark Haacke, Wen Shen, Chen Cao, Xinchen Ye, Zhiyang Liu, Shuang Xia","Abnormal iron accumulation in the brain subcortical nuclei has been reported to be correlated to various neurodegenerative diseases, which can be measured through the magnetic susceptibility from the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). To quantitively measure the magnetic susceptibility, the nuclei should be accurately segmented, which is a tedious task for clinicians. In this paper, we proposed a double-branch residual-structured U-Net (DB-ResUNet) based on 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment such brain gray matter nuclei. To better tradeoff between segmentation accuracy and the memory efficiency, the proposed DB-ResUNet fed image patches with high resolution and the patches with low resolution but larger field of view into the local and global branches, respectively. Experimental results revealed that by jointly using QSM and T$_\text{1}$ weighted imaging (T$_\text{1}$WI) as inputs, the proposed method was able to achieve better segmentation accuracy over its single-branch counterpart, as well as the conventional atlas-based method and the classical 3D-UNet structure.

We settle the question of whether (quantitative) absolute continuity of the elliptic measure with respect to the surface measure and uniform rectifiability of the boundary are equivalent, in an optimal class of divergence form elliptic operators satisfying a suitable Carleson measure condition. The result can be viewed as a quantitative analogue of the Wiener criterion adapted to the singular $L^p$ data case.   We split our proof on two main steps. In the first one we considered the case in which the desired Carleson measure condition on the coefficients holds with ""sufficiently small constant"", using a novel application of techniques developed in geometric measure theory. In the second step we establish the final result, that is, the ""large constant case"".

Weakly-supervised Learning for Single-step Quantitative Susceptibility   Mapping,"Juan Liu, Kevin M Koch","Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) utilizes MRI phase information to estimate tissue magnetic susceptibility. The generation of QSM requires solving ill-posed background field removal (BFR) and field-to-source inversion problems. Because current QSM techniques struggle to generate reliable QSM in clinical contexts, QSM clinical translation is greatly hindered. Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches for QSM reconstruction have shown impressive performance. Due to inherent non-existent ground-truth, these DL techniques use either calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling (COSMOS) maps or synthetic data for training, which are constrained by the availability and accuracy of COSMOS maps or domain shift when training data and testing data have different domains. To address these limitations, we propose a weakly-supervised single-step QSM reconstruction method, denoted as wTFI, to directly reconstruct QSM from the total field without BFR. wTFI uses the BFR method RESHARP local fields as supervision to perform a multi-task learning of local tissue fields and QSM, and is capable of recovering magnetic susceptibility estimates near the edges of the brain where are eroded in RESHARP and realize whole brain QSM estimation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows that wTFI can generate high-quality local field and susceptibility maps in a variety of neuroimaging contexts.",2020-08-14T04:28:08Z,2020-08-14T04:28:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06187v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06187v1,"eess.IV, cs.LG"
DIR-DBTnet: Deep iterative reconstruction network for 3D digital breast   tomosynthesis imaging,"Ting Su, Xiaolei Deng, Zhenwei Wang, Jiecheng Yang, Jianwei Chen, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Yongshuai Ge","Purpose: The goal of this study is to develop a novel deep learning (DL) based reconstruction framework to improve the digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging performance. Methods: In this work, the DIR-DBTnet is developed for DBT image reconstruction by unrolling the standard iterative reconstruction algorithm within the deep learning framework. In particular, such network learns the regularizer and the iteration parameters automatically through network training with a large amount of simulated DBT data. Afterwards, both numerical and experimental data are used to evaluate its performance. Quantitative metrics such as the artifact spread function (ASF), breast density, and the signal difference to noise ratio (SDNR) are used for image quality assessment. Results: For both numerical and experimental data, the proposed DIR-DBTnet generates reduced in-plane shadow artifacts and out-of-plane artifacts compared with the filtered back projection (FBP) and total variation (TV) methods. Quantitatively, the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the measured ASF curve from the numerical data is 33.4% and 19.7% smaller than those obtained with the FBP and TV methods, respectively; the breast density of the network reconstructed DBT images is more accurate and consistent with the ground truth.

Especially standard fitting using non-linear least squares often fails in regions with poor SNR, resulting in noisy estimates of the quantitative maps. State-of-the-art fitting techniques improve the SNR by incorporating prior knowledge in the estimation process which typically leads to spatial blurring. To this end, we propose a new estimation method with a joint spatial total generalized variation regularization on CBF and ATT. This joint regularization approach utilizes shared spatial features across maps to enhance sharpness and simultaneously improves noise suppression in the final estimates. The proposed method is evaluated at three levels, first on synthetic phantom data including pathologies, followed by in vivo acquisitions of healthy volunteers, and finally on patient data following an ischemic stroke. The quantitative estimates are compared to two reference methods, non-linear least squares fitting and a state-of-the-art ASL quantification algorithm based on Bayesian inference.

On the Fourier transform of a quantitative trait: Implications for   compressive sensing,"Stephen Doro, Matthew A. Herman","This paper explores the genotype-phenotype relationship. It outlines conditions under which the dependence of a quantitative trait on the genome might be predictable, based on measurement of a limited subset of genotypes. It uses the theory of real-valued Boolean functions in a systematic way to translate trait data into the Fourier domain. Important trait features, such as the roughness of the trait landscape or the modularity of a trait have a simple Fourier interpretation. Ruggedness at a gene location corresponds to high sensitivity to mutation, while a modular organization of gene activity reduces such sensitivity.   Traits where rugged loci are rare will naturally compress gene data in the Fourier domain, leading to a sparse representation of trait data, concentrated in identifiable, low-level coefficients. This Fourier representation of a trait organizes epistasis in a form which is isometric to the trait data. As Fourier matrices are known to be maximally incoherent with the standard basis, this permits employing compressive sensing techniques to work from data sets that are relatively small -- sometimes even of polynomial size -- compared to the exponentially large sets of possible genomes.   This theory provides a theoretical underpinning for systematic use of Boolean function machinery to dissect the dependency of a trait on the genome and environment.",2021-01-04T20:54:43Z,2022-03-14T17:13:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01234v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01234v3,"q-bio.QM, cs.IT, math.IT, q-bio.MN, 92C42, 92D20 (Primary), 68P30, 94D10, 17D92 (Secondary), J.3; E.4"

Automated quantitative analysis of first-pass myocardial perfusion   magnetic resonance imaging data,Cian M Scannell,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the world's leading cause of mortality and the disease burden is continually expanding as the population ages. Recently, the MR-INFORM randomised trial has demonstrated that the management of patients with stable CAD can be guided by stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and it is non-inferior to the using the invasive reference standard of fractional flow reserve. The benefits of using stress perfusion CMR include that it is non-invasive and significantly reduces the number of unnecessary coronary revascularisations. As compared to other ischaemia tests, it boasts a high spatial resolution and does not expose the patient to ionising radiation. However, the main limitation of stress perfusion CMR is that the diagnostic accuracy is highly dependent on the level of training of the operator, resulting in the test only being performed routinely in experienced tertiary centres. The clinical translation of stress perfusion CMR would be greatly aided by a fully automated, user-independent, quantitative evaluation of myocardial blood flow. This thesis presents major steps towards this goal: robust motion correction, automated image processing, reliable quantitative modelling, and thorough validation. The motion correction scheme makes use of data decomposition techniques, such as robust principal component analysis, to mitigate the difficulties in image registration caused by the dynamic contrast enhancement. The motion corrected image series are input to a processing pipeline which leverages the recent advances in image processing facilitated by deep learning.

Fluctuating ecological networks: a synthesis of maximum-entropy   approaches for pattern detection and process inference,"Tancredi Caruso, Giulio Virginio Clemente, Matthias C Rillig, Diego Garlaschelli","Ecological networks such as plant-pollinator systems and food webs vary in space and time. This variability includes fluctuations in global network properties such as total number and intensity of interactions but also in the local properties of individual nodes such as the number and intensity of species-level interactions. Fluctuations of species properties can significantly affect higher-order network features, e.g. robustness and nestedness. Local fluctuations should therefore be controlled for in applications that rely on null models, especially pattern and perturbation detection. By contrast, most randomization methods for null models used by ecologists treat node-level local properties as hard constraints that cannot fluctuate. Here, we synthesise a set of methods that resolves the limit of hard constraints and is based on statistical mechanics. We illustrate the methods with some practical examples making available open source computer codes. We clarify how this approach can be used by experimental ecologists to detect non-random network patterns with null models that not only rewire but also redistribute interaction strengths by allowing fluctuations in the null model constraints (soft constraints). Null modelling of species heterogeneity through local fluctuations around typical topological and quantitative constraints offers a statistically robust and expanded (e.g. quantitative null models) set of tools to understand the assembly and resilience of ecological networks.",2021-06-25T11:23:59Z,2022-03-11T09:03:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13565v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13565v2,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.data-an"

Estimating tissue properties from a single scan session using a protocol available on all clinical scanners promises to reduce scan time and cost, enable quantitative analysis in routine clinical scans and provide scan-independent biomarkers of disease. However, existing tissue properties estimation methods - most often $\mathbf{T_1}$ relaxation, $\mathbf{T_2^*}$ relaxation, and proton density ($\mathbf{PD}$) - require data from multiple scan sessions and cannot estimate all properties from a single clinically available MRI protocol such as the multiecho MRI scan. In addition, the widespread use of non-standard acquisition parameters across clinical imaging sites require estimation methods that can generalize across varying scanner parameters. However, existing learning methods are acquisition protocol specific and cannot estimate from heterogenous clinical data from different imaging sites. In this work we propose an unsupervised deep-learning strategy that employs MRI physics to estimate all three tissue properties from a single multiecho MRI scan session, and generalizes across varying acquisition parameters. The proposed strategy optimizes accurate synthesis of new MRI contrasts from estimated latent tissue properties, enabling unsupervised training, we also employ random acquisition parameters during training to achieve acquisition generalization. We provide the first demonstration of estimating all tissue properties from a single multiecho scan session. We demonstrate improved accuracy and generalizability for tissue property estimation and MRI synthesis.",2021-07-06T16:07:14Z,2021-07-06T16:07:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02704v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02704v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.NC, q-bio.QM"
Statistical spatial analysis for cryo-electron tomography,"Antonio Martinez-Sanchez, Wolfgang Baumeister, Vladan Lučić","Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is uniquely suited to precisely localize macromolecular complexes in situ, that is in a close-to-native state within their cellular compartments, in three-dimensions at high resolution. Point pattern analysis (PPA) allows quantitative characterization of the spatial organization of particles. However, current implementations of PPA functions are not suitable for applications to cryo-ET data because they do not consider the real, typically irregular 3D shape of cellular compartments and molecular complexes. Here, we designed and implemented first and the second-order, uni- and bivariate PPA functions in a Python package for statistical spatial analysis of particles located in three dimensional regions of arbitrary shape, such as those encountered in cellular cryo-ET imaging (PyOrg).   To validate the implemented functions, we applied them to specially designed synthetic datasets. This allowed us to find the algorithmic solutions that provide the best accuracy and computational performance, and to evaluate the precision of the implemented functions. Applications to experimental data showed that despite the higher computational demand, the use of the second-order functions is advantageous to the first-order ones, because they allow characterization of the particle organization and statistical inference over a range of distance scales, as well as the comparative analysis between experimental groups comprising multiple tomograms.

Data-based stochastic modeling reveals sources of activity bursts in   single-cell TGF-$β$ signaling,"Niklas Kolbe, Lorenz Hexemer, Lukas-Malte Bammert, Alexander Loewer, Mária Lukáčová-Medviďová, Stefan Legewie","Cells sense their surrounding by employing intracellular signaling pathways that transmit hormonal signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. TGF-$\beta$/SMAD signaling encodes various cell fates, controls tissue homeostasis and is deregulated in diseases such as cancer. The pathway shows strong heterogeneity at the single-cell level, but quantitative insights into mechanisms underlying fluctuations at various time scales are still missing, partly due to inefficiency in the calibration of stochastic models that mechanistically describe signaling processes. In this work we analyze single-cell TGF-$\beta$/SMAD signaling and show that it exhibits temporal stochastic bursts which are dose-dependent and whose number and magnitude correlate with cell migration. We propose a stochastic modeling approach to mechanistically describe these pathway fluctuations with high computational efficiency. Employing high-order numerical integration and fitting to burst statistics we enable efficient quantitative parameter estimation and discriminate models that assume noise in different reactions at the receptor level. This modeling approach suggests that stochasticity in the internalization of TGF-$\beta$ receptors into endosomes plays a key role in the observed temporal bursting. Further, the model predicts the single-cell dynamics of TGF-$\beta$/SMAD signaling in untested conditions, e.g., successfully reflects memory effects of signaling noise and cellular sensitivity towards repeated stimulation. Taken together, our computational framework based on burst analysis, noise modeling and path computation scheme is a suitable tool for the data-based modeling of complex signaling pathways, capable of identifying the source of temporal noise.",2021-07-25T09:49:42Z,2022-01-25T21:13:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11770v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11770v2,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM, 92C37 (Primary) 92-08, 92C42 (Secondary)"

Quantitative reconstruction of defects in multi-layered bonded   composites using fully convolutional network-based ultrasonic inversion,"Jing Rao, Fangshu Yang, Huadong Mo, Stefan Kollmannsberger, Ernst Rank","Ultrasonic methods have great potential applications to detect and characterize defects in multi-layered bonded composites. However, it remains challenging to quantitatively reconstruct defects, such as disbonds and kissing bonds, that influence the integrity of adhesive bonds and seriously reduce the strength of assemblies. In this work, an ultrasonic method based on the supervised fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed to quantitatively reconstruct defects hidden in multi-layered bonded composites. In the training process of this method, an FCN establishes a non-linear mapping from measured ultrasonic data to the corresponding velocity models of multi-layered bonded composites. In the predicting process, the trained network obtained from the training process is used to directly reconstruct the velocity models from the new measured ultrasonic data of adhesively bonded composites. The presented FCN-based inversion method can automatically extract useful features in multi-layered composites. Although this method is computationally expensive in the training process, the prediction itself in the online phase takes only seconds. The numerical results show that the FCN-based ultrasonic inversion method is capable to accurately reconstruct ultrasonic velocity models of the high contrast defects, which has great potential for online detection of adhesively bonded composites.",2021-09-11T10:34:22Z,2021-09-11T10:34:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07284v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07284v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG"
Prediction of shear-thickening of particle suspensions in viscoelastic   fluids by direct numerical simulation,"Yuki Matsuoka, Yasuya Nakayama, Toshihisa Kajiwara","To elucidate the key factor for the quantitative prediction of the shear-thickening in suspensions in viscoelastic fluids, direct numerical simulations of many-particle suspensions in a multi-mode Oldroyd-B fluid are performed using the smoothed profile method. Suspension flow under simple shear flow is solved under periodic boundary conditions by using Lees--Edwards boundary conditions for particle dynamics and a time-dependent oblique coordinate system that evolves with mean shear flow for fluid dynamics. Semi-dilute many-particle suspensions up to a particle volume fraction of 0.1 are investigated. The presented numerical results regarding the bulk rheological properties of the shear-thickening behavior agree quantitatively with recent experimental results of semi-dilute suspensions in a Boger fluid. The presented result clarifies that an accurate estimation of the first normal stress difference of the matrix in the shear-rate range where the shear-thickening starts to occur is crucial for the quantitative prediction of the suspension shear-thickening in a Boger fluid matrix at around the Weissenberg number $\rm{Wi}=1$ by an Oldroyd-B model.

"Self-interacting random walks : aging, exploration and first-passage   times","Alex Barbier--Chebbah, Olivier Benichou, Raphael Voituriez","Self-interacting random walks are endowed with long range memory effects that emerge from the interaction of the random walker at time $t$ with the territory that it has visited at earlier times $t'<t$. This class of non Markovian random walks has applications in a broad range of examples, ranging from insects to living cells, where a random walker modifies locally its environment -- leaving behind footprints along its path, and in turn responds to its own footprints. Because of their inherent non Markovian nature, the exploration properties of self-interacting random walks have remained elusive. Here we show that long range memory effects can have deep consequences on the dynamics of generic self-interacting random walks ; they can induce aging and non trivial persistence and transience exponents, which we determine quantitatively, in both infinite and confined geometries. Based on this analysis, we quantify the search kinetics of self-interacting random walkers and show that the distribution of the first-passage time (FPT) to a target site in a confined domain takes universal scaling forms in the large domain size limit, which we characterize quantitatively. We argue that memory abilities induced by attractive self-interactions provide a decisive advantage for local space exploration, while repulsive self-interactions can significantly accelerate the global exploration of large domains.",2021-09-27T15:41:34Z,2021-09-27T15:41:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13127v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13127v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.QM"
Bend-Net: Bending Loss Regularized Multitask Learning Network for Nuclei   Segmentation in Histopathology Images,"Haotian Wang, Aleksandar Vakanski, Changfa Shi, Min Xian","Separating overlapped nuclei is a major challenge in histopathology image analysis. Recently published approaches have achieved promising overall performance on nuclei segmentation; however, their performance on separating overlapped nuclei is quite limited. To address the issue, we propose a novel multitask learning network with a bending loss regularizer to separate overlapped nuclei accurately. The newly proposed multitask learning architecture enhances the generalization by learning shared representation from three tasks: instance segmentation, nuclei distance map prediction, and overlapped nuclei distance map prediction. The proposed bending loss defines high penalties to concave contour points with large curvatures, and applies small penalties to convex contour points with small curvatures. Minimizing the bending loss avoids generating contours that encompass multiple nuclei. In addition, two new quantitative metrics, Aggregated Jaccard Index of overlapped nuclei (AJIO) and Accuracy of overlapped nuclei (ACCO), are designed for the evaluation of overlapped nuclei segmentation. We validate the proposed approach on the CoNSeP and MoNuSegv1 datasets using seven quantitative metrics: Aggregate Jaccard Index, Dice, Segmentation Quality, Recognition Quality, Panoptic Quality, AJIO, and ACCO.

To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential. However, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks which hinders the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work, we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods in particular in time series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely dependence on human judgement, retraining, and shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We additionally design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity.

Recently, single-cell imaging experiments have determined the 3D coordinates of a number of loci in a chromosome. Here, we introduce a computational method (Distance Matrix to Ensemble of Structures, DIMES), based on the maximum entropy principle, with experimental pair-wise distances between loci as constraints, to generate a unique ensemble of 3D chromatin structures. Using the ensemble of structures, we quantitatively account for the distribution of pair-wise distances, three-body co-localization and higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that the DIMES method can be applied to both small length-scale and chromosome-scale imaging data to quantify the extent of heterogeneity and fluctuations in the shapes on various length scales. We develop a perturbation method that is used in conjunction with DIMES to predict the changes in 3D structures from structural variations. Our method also reveals quantitative differences between the 3D structures inferred from Hi-C and the ones measured in imaging experiments. Finally, the physical interpretation of the parameters extracted from DIMES provides insights into the origin of phase separation between euchromatin and heterochromatin domains.",2022-03-15T20:28:26Z,2022-11-09T15:12:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08238v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08238v2,"cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.BM, q-bio.QM"

Score following is a challenging task, especially when considering deviations in performance data from the score stemming from mistakes or expressive choices.   In this project, the extensive research present in the field is first explored before two open-source evaluation testbenches for score following--one quantitative and the other qualitative--are introduced. A new way of obtaining quantitative testbench data is proposed, and the QualScofo dataset for qualitative benchmarking is introduced. Subsequently, three different score followers, each of a different class, are implemented. First, a beat-based follower for an interactive conductor application--the TuneApp Conductor--is created to demonstrate an entertaining application of score following. Then, an Approximate String Matching (ASM) non-real-time follower is implemented to complement the quantitative testbench and provide more technical background details of score following.

Then we further determine the associated interior eigenfunctions by solving a constrained optimization problem, again only involving the far-field data. In the second phase, we propose a novel iteration scheme of Newton's type to identify the boundary surface of the obstacle. By using the interior eigenfunctions determined in the first phase, we can avoid computing any direct scattering problem at each Newton's iteration. The proposed method is particularly valuable for recovering a sound-hard obstacle, where the Newton's formula involves the geometric quantities of the unknown boundary surface in a natural way.

Randomized Synthesis for Diversity and Cost Constraints with Control   Improvisation,"Andreas Gittis, Eric Vin, Daniel J. Fremont","In many synthesis problems, it can be essential to generate implementations which not only satisfy functional constraints but are also randomized to improve variety, robustness, or unpredictability. The recently-proposed framework of control improvisation (CI) provides techniques for the correct-by-construction synthesis of randomized systems subject to hard and soft constraints. However, prior work on CI has focused on qualitative specifications, whereas in robotic planning and other areas we often have quantitative quality metrics which can be traded against each other. For example, a designer of a patrolling security robot might want to know by how much the average patrol time needs to be increased in order to ensure that a particular aspect of the robot's route is sufficiently diverse and hence unpredictable. In this paper, we enable this type of application by generalizing the CI problem to support quantitative soft constraints which bound the expected value of a given cost function, and randomness constraints which enforce diversity of the generated traces with respect to a given label function. We establish the basic theory of labelled quantitative CI problems, and develop efficient algorithms for solving them when the specifications are encoded by finite automata. We also provide an approximate improvisation algorithm based on constraint solving for any specifications encodable as Boolean formulas.

The DSP is based on the key observation that most pixel values for an idea differential phase contrast image are zeros since the subtraction of two images under anti-symmetric illumination cancels all background components. With this DSP prior, we formed a new cost function in which L0-norm was used to represent the DSP. Further, we developed two different algorithms based on (1) the Half Quadratic Splitting, and (2) the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution to solve this NP-hard L0-norm problem. We tested our new model on both simulated and experimental data and compare against state-of-the-art methods including L2-norm and total variation regularizations.

k-Sliced Mutual Information: A Quantitative Study of Scalability with   Dimension,"Ziv Goldfeld, Kristjan Greenewald, Theshani Nuradha, Galen Reeves","Sliced mutual information (SMI) is defined as an average of mutual information (MI) terms between one-dimensional random projections of the random variables. It serves as a surrogate measure of dependence to classic MI that preserves many of its properties but is more scalable to high dimensions. However, a quantitative characterization of how SMI itself and estimation rates thereof depend on the ambient dimension, which is crucial to the understanding of scalability, remain obscure. This work provides a multifaceted account of the dependence of SMI on dimension, under a broader framework termed $k$-SMI, which considers projections to $k$-dimensional subspaces. Using a new result on the continuity of differential entropy in the 2-Wasserstein metric, we derive sharp bounds on the error of Monte Carlo (MC)-based estimates of $k$-SMI, with explicit dependence on $k$ and the ambient dimension, revealing their interplay with the number of samples. We then combine the MC integrator with the neural estimation framework to provide an end-to-end $k$-SMI estimator, for which optimal convergence rates are established. We also explore asymptotics of the population $k$-SMI as dimension grows, providing Gaussian approximation results with a residual that decays under appropriate moment bounds. All our results trivially apply to SMI by setting $k=1$. Our theory is validated with numerical experiments and is applied to sliced InfoGAN, which altogether provide a comprehensive quantitative account of the scalability question of $k$-SMI, including SMI as a special case when $k=1$.",2022-06-17T03:19:55Z,2022-10-14T20:27:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08526v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08526v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, stat.ML"

For prognostic assessment, survival analysis was performed comparing the expert diagnostic labels versus TM metrics. Results: In the classification analysis, the TM model outperformed the HM method with AUC of 0.70. While survival curves of UIP vs non-UIP expert labels in Cox regression analysis were not statistically different, TM QCT features allowed statistically significant partition of the cohort. Conclusions: TM model outperformed HM model in distinguishing UIP from non-UIP patterns. Most importantly, TM allows for partitioning of the cohort into distinct survival groups, whereas expert UIP vs non-UIP labeling does not. QCT TM models may improve diagnosis of ILD and offer more accurate prognostication, better guiding patient management.",2022-06-20T13:27:38Z,2022-06-20T13:27:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09766v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09766v1,"eess.IV, cs.LG, q-bio.QM, stat.ML"
A Quantitative Analysis of Dynamic Mechanisms Regulating HIV Latency and   Activation,"Ruiqi Xiong, Yang Su, Ping Ao","Objective: The reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) latently infected cells is the major obstacle for eradication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Due to the noisy environment and multiple influencing factors in the organism, current dynamical models cannot reach a common understanding of the molecular mechanism of HIV latency. In this work, through a new dynamical structure decomposition, the deterministic part of the equation can be separated from the stochastic noise. Thus, the fixed-point analysis of ordinary differential equation is enough to obtain the different steady states of the system. Methods: We established a dynamical model of HIV transcription process by using continuous stochastic differential equations, which simplifies the dimensions of equations needed to describe the system and increases the explorable space of the model. Different states between latency and activation of virus and their relations can be intuitively represented by potential functions and probability distribution functions. Results: Based on our model, the influence of different dynamical parameters on stability is quantitatively analyzed, the parameter ranges of the system in bistable and monostable states are obtained respectively. The theoretical basis of this work is verified by comparing the effects of different factors on dynamic bifurcation with the results of biological experiments. Conclusion: This paper goes beyond previous discrete stochastic methods, and can quantitatively analyze the dynamic mechanism of HIV transcriptional regulation through ordinary differential equations, which is beneficial to the promotion to deal with the high-dimensional situation, and further study the occurrence and development of AIDS in vivo, so as to guide the design of experiments and search for clinical treatment.",2022-06-21T16:20:23Z,2022-06-22T04:53:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10501v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10501v2,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio.MN"
BMD-GAN: Bone mineral density estimation using x-ray image decomposition   into projections of bone-segmented quantitative computed tomography using   hierarchical learning,"Yi Gu, Yoshito Otake, Keisuke Uemura, Mazen Soufi, Masaki Takao, Nobuhiko Sugano, Yoshinobu Sato","We propose a method for estimating the bone mineral density (BMD) from a plain x-ray image. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) provide high accuracy in diagnosing osteoporosis; however, these modalities require special equipment and scan protocols. Measuring BMD from an x-ray image provides an opportunistic screening, which is potentially useful for early diagnosis. The previous methods that directly learn the relationship between x-ray images and BMD require a large training dataset to achieve high accuracy because of large intensity variations in the x-ray images. Therefore, we propose an approach using the QCT for training a generative adversarial network (GAN) and decomposing an x-ray image into a projection of bone-segmented QCT. The proposed hierarchical learning improved the robustness and accuracy of quantitatively decomposing a small-area target. The evaluation of 200 patients with osteoarthritis using the proposed method, which we named BMD-GAN, demonstrated a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.888 between the predicted and ground truth DXA-measured BMD. Besides not requiring a large-scale training database, another advantage of our method is its extensibility to other anatomical areas, such as the vertebrae and rib bones.",2022-07-07T10:33:12Z,2022-07-07T10:33:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03210v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.03210v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

Menze, Benjamin Knier, Daniel Rueckert","Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can non-invasively image the eye's circulatory system. In order to reliably characterize the retinal vasculature, there is a need to automatically extract quantitative metrics from these images. The calculation of such biomarkers requires a precise semantic segmentation of the blood vessels. However, deep-learning-based methods for segmentation mostly rely on supervised training with voxel-level annotations, which are costly to obtain. In this work, we present a pipeline to synthesize large amounts of realistic OCTA images with intrinsically matching ground truth labels; thereby obviating the need for manual annotation of training data. Our proposed method is based on two novel components: 1) a physiology-based simulation that models the various retinal vascular plexuses and 2) a suite of physics-based image augmentations that emulate the OCTA image acquisition process including typical artifacts. In extensive benchmarking experiments, we demonstrate the utility of our synthetic data by successfully training retinal vessel segmentation algorithms. Encouraged by our method's competitive quantitative and superior qualitative performance, we believe that it constitutes a versatile tool to advance the quantitative analysis of OCTA images.",2022-07-22T14:22:22Z,2022-07-22T14:22:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11102v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

However, the accuracy of the technique has not been characterised in detail so far. Here we show that optical aberrations in the imaging system may cause large systematic errors in the measured quantity beyond trivial blurring. We introduce a simple theoretical framework to model these effects, which extends the concept of a point spread function to the domain of spectral imaging. Using this model, the magnetic field imaging of test magnetic samples is simulated under various scenarios, and the resulting errors quantified. We then apply the model to previously published data, show that apparent magnetic anomalies can be explained by the presence of optical aberrations, and demonstrate a post-processing technique to retrieve the source quantity with improved accuracy.

"Cognitive modelling with multilayer networks: Insights, advancements and   future challenges","Massimo Stella, Salvatore Citraro, Giulio Rossetti, Daniele Marinazzo, Yoed N. Kenett, Michael S. Vitevitch","The mental lexicon is a complex cognitive system representing information about the words/concepts that one knows. Decades of psychological experiments have shown that conceptual associations across multiple, interactive cognitive levels can greatly influence word acquisition, storage, and processing. How can semantic, phonological, syntactic, and other types of conceptual associations be mapped within a coherent mathematical framework to study how the mental lexicon works? We here review cognitive multilayer networks as a promising quantitative and interpretative framework for investigating the mental lexicon. Cognitive multilayer networks can map multiple types of information at once, thus capturing how different layers of associations might co-exist within the mental lexicon and influence cognitive processing. This review starts with a gentle introduction to the structure and formalism of multilayer networks. We then discuss quantitative mechanisms of psychological phenomena that could not be observed in single-layer networks and were only unveiled by combining multiple layers of the lexicon: (i) multiplex viability highlights language kernels and facilitative effects of knowledge processing in healthy and clinical populations; (ii) multilayer community detection enables contextual meaning reconstruction depending on psycholinguistic features; (iii) layer analysis can mediate latent interactions of mediation, suppression and facilitation for lexical access. By outlining novel quantitative perspectives where multilayer networks can shed light on cognitive knowledge representations, also in next-generation brain/mind models, we discuss key limitations and promising directions for cutting-edge future research.",2022-10-02T12:22:53Z,2022-10-02T12:22:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00500v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00500v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.SI, physics.data-an, q-bio.NC"
Advanced Characterization-Informed Framework and Quantitative Insight to   Irradiated Annular U-10Zr Metallic Fuels,"Fei Xu, Lu Cai, Daniele Salvato, Fidelma Dilemma, Luca Capriotti, Tiankai Yao","U-10Zr-based metallic nuclear fuel is a promising fuel candidate for next-generation sodium-cooled fast reactors.The research experience of the Idaho National Laboratory for this type of fuel dates back to the 1960s. Idaho National Laboratory researchers have accumulated a considerable amount of experience and knowledge regarding fuel performance at the engineering scale. The limitation of advanced characterization and lack of proper data analysis tools prevented a mechanistic understanding of fuel microstructure evolution and properties degradation during irradiation. This paper proposed a new workflow, coupled with domain knowledge obtained by advanced post-irradiation examination methods, to provide unprecedented and quantified insights into the fission gas bubbles and pores, and lanthanide distribution in an annular fuel irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor. In the study, researchers identify and confirm that the Zr-bearing secondary phases exist and generate the quantitative ratios of seven microstructures along the thermal gradient. Moreover, the distributions of fission gas bubbles on two samples of U-10Zr advanced fuels were quantitatively compared. Conclusive findings were obtained and allowed for evaluation of the lanthanide transportation through connected bubbles based on approximately 67,000 fission gas bubbles of the two advanced samples.",2022-10-17T13:54:49Z,2022-10-17T13:54:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09104v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09104v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.CV"

In biophysical modeling, it is commonly assumed that the complex spatial arrangement of myelinated and unmyelinated axons in peripheral nerves is random, however, in reality the axonal organization is inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Present quantitative neuroanatomy methods analyze peripheral nerves in terms of the number of axons and the morphometric characteristics of the axons, such as area and diameter. In this study, we employed spatial statistics and point process models to describe the spatial arrangement of axons and Sinkhorn distances to compute the similarities between these arrangements (in terms of first- and second-order statistics) in various vagus and pelvic nerve cross-sections. We utilized high-resolution TEM images that have been segmented using a custom-built high-throughput deep learning system based on a highly modified U-Net architecture. Our findings show a novel and innovative approach to quantifying similarities between spatial point patterns using metrics derived from the solution to the optimal transport problem.

Comparison of Popular Video Conferencing Apps Using Client-side   Measurements on Different Backhaul Networks,"Rohan Kumar, Dhruv Nagpal, Vinayak Naik, Dipanjan Chakraborty","Video conferencing platforms have been appropriated during the COVID-19 pandemic for different purposes, including classroom teaching. However, the platforms are not designed for many of these objectives. When users, like educationists, select a platform, it is unclear which platform will perform better given the same network and hardware resources to meet the required Quality of Experience (QoE). Similarly, when developers design a new video conferencing platform, they do not have clear guidelines for making design choices given the QoE requirements.   In this paper, we provide a set of networks and systems measurements, and quantitative user studies to measure the performance of video conferencing apps in terms of both, Quality of Service (QoS) and QoE. Using those metrics, we measure the performance of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom, which are three popular platforms in education and business. We find a substantial difference in how the three apps treat video and audio streams. We see that their choice of treatment affects their consumption of hardware resources. Our quantitative user studies confirm the findings of our quantitative measurements. While each platform has its benefits, we find that no app is ideal.

Enrichment Score: a better quantitative metric for evaluating the   enrichment capacity of molecular docking models,"Ian Scott Knight, Slava Naprienko, John J. Irwin","The standard quantitative metric for evaluating enrichment capacity known as $\textit{LogAUC}$ depends on a cutoff parameter that controls what the minimum value of the log-scaled x-axis is. Unless this parameter is chosen carefully for a given ROC curve, one of the two following problems occurs: either (1) some fraction of the first inter-decoy intervals of the ROC curve are simply thrown away and do not contribute to the metric at all, or (2) the very first inter-decoy interval contributes too much to the metric at the expense of all following inter-decoy intervals. We fix this problem with LogAUC by showing a simple way to choose the cutoff parameter based on the number of decoys which forces the first inter-decoy interval to always have a stable, sensible contribution to the total value. Moreover, we introduce a normalized version of LogAUC known as $\textit{enrichment score}$, which (1) enforces stability by selecting the cutoff parameter in the manner described, (2) yields scores which are more intuitively meaningful, and (3) allows reliably accurate comparison of the enrichment capacities exhibited by different ROC curves, even those produced using different numbers of decoys. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of enrichment score over unbalanced metrics using data from a real retrospective docking study performed using the program $\textit{DOCK 3.7}$ on the target receptor TRYB1 included in the $\textit{DUDE-Z}$ benchmark.",2022-10-19T22:02:55Z,2023-05-22T01:44:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10905v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10905v4,"q-bio.QM, stat.AP"
Conformal Quantitative Predictive Monitoring of STL Requirements for   Stochastic Processes,"Francesca Cairoli, Nicola Paoletti, Luca Bortolussi","We consider the problem of predictive monitoring (PM), i.e., predicting at runtime the satisfaction of a desired property from the current system's state. Due to its relevance for runtime safety assurance and online control, PM methods need to be efficient to enable timely interventions against predicted violations, while providing correctness guarantees. We introduce \textit{quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM)}, the first PM method to support stochastic processes and rich specifications given in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Unlike most of the existing PM techniques that predict whether or not some property $\phi$ is satisfied, QPM provides a quantitative measure of satisfaction by predicting the quantitative (aka robust) STL semantics of $\phi$. QPM derives prediction intervals that are highly efficient to compute and with probabilistic guarantees, in that the intervals cover with arbitrary probability the STL robustness values relative to the stochastic evolution of the system. To do so, we take a machine-learning approach and leverage recent advances in conformal inference for quantile regression, thereby avoiding expensive Monte-Carlo simulations at runtime to estimate the intervals. We also show how our monitors can be combined in a compositional manner to handle composite formulas, without retraining the predictors nor sacrificing the guarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of QPM over a benchmark of four discrete-time stochastic processes with varying degrees of complexity.",2022-11-04T11:08:29Z,2023-04-06T09:22:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02375v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02375v2,"eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.LO, cs.RO, cs.SY"
Quantum gravity and scale symmetry in cosmology,C. Wetterich,"We discuss predictions for cosmology which result from the scaling solution of functional flow equations for a quantum field theory of gravity. A scaling solution is necessary to render quantum gravity renormalizable. Our scaling solution is directly connected to the quantum effective action for the metric coupled to a scalar field. It includes all effects of quantum fluctuations and is invariant under general coordinate transformations. Solving the cosmological field equations derived by variation of the quantum effective action provides for a detailed quantitative description of the evolution of the universe. The \qq{beginning state} of the universe is found close to an ultraviolet fixed point of the flow equation. It can be described by an inflationary epoch, with approximate scale invariance of the observed primordial fluctuation spectrum explained by approximate quantum scale symmetry. Overall cosmology realizes a dynamical crossover from the ultraviolet fixed point to an infrared fixed point which is approached in the infinite future. Present cosmology is close to the infrared fixed point. It features dynamical dark energy mediated by a light scalar field. The tiny mass of this cosmon arises from its role as a pseudo Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken quantum scale symmetry. The extremely small value of the present dark energy density in Planck units results dynamically as a consequence of the huge age of the universe. The cosmological constant problem finds a dynamical solution. We present a detailed quantitative computation of the scaling solution for the scalar effective potential and the field-dependent coefficient of the curvature scalar. This allows for further quantitative predictions.",2022-11-07T14:35:03Z,2023-01-12T14:54:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03596v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03596v2,"gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th"
High-fidelity Direct Contrast Synthesis from Magnetic Resonance   Fingerprinting,"Ke Wang, Mariya Doneva, Jakob Meineke, Thomas Amthor, Ekin Karasan, Fei Tan, Jonathan I. Tamir, Stella X. Yu, Michael Lustig","Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is an efficient quantitative MRI technique that can extract important tissue and system parameters such as T1, T2, B0, and B1 from a single scan. This property also makes it attractive for retrospectively synthesizing contrast-weighted images. In general, contrast-weighted images like T1-weighted, T2-weighted, etc., can be synthesized directly from parameter maps through spin-dynamics simulation (i.e., Bloch or Extended Phase Graph models). However, these approaches often exhibit artifacts due to imperfections in the mapping, the sequence modeling, and the data acquisition. Here we propose a supervised learning-based method that directly synthesizes contrast-weighted images from the MRF data without going through the quantitative mapping and spin-dynamics simulation. To implement our direct contrast synthesis (DCS) method, we deploy a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework and propose a multi-branch U-Net as the generator. The input MRF data are used to directly synthesize T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images through supervised training on paired MRF and target spin echo-based contrast-weighted scans. In-vivo experiments demonstrate excellent image quality compared to simulation-based contrast synthesis and previous DCS methods, both visually as well as by quantitative metrics. We also demonstrate cases where our trained model is able to mitigate in-flow and spiral off-resonance artifacts that are typically seen in MRF reconstructions and thus more faithfully represent conventional spin echo-based contrast-weighted images.",2022-12-21T07:11:39Z,2022-12-21T07:11:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10817v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10817v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

Methods: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images of 30 eyes from 20 healthy controls, 21 eyes of diabetic patients with no DR (NoDR) and 26 eyes from 22 patients with mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) were analyzed in this study. The OCTA images were centered on the fovea and covered a 6 mm x 6 mm area. Enface projections of the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP) were obtained for the quantitative OCTA feature analysis. Three quantitative OCTA features were examined: blood vessel density (BVD), blood flow flux (BFF), and normalized blood flow index (NBFI). Each feature was calculated from both the SVP and DCP and their sensitivity to distinguish the three cohorts of the study were evaluated. Results: The only quantitative feature that was capable of distinguishing between all three cohorts was NBFI in the DCP image. Comparative study revealed that both BVD and BFF were able to distinguish the controls from NoDR and mild NPDR. However, neither BVD nor BFF was sensitive enough to separate NoDR from the healthy controls.

Despite its advantage in prediction, deep learning relies on extremely large data volume and labor-intensive tuning of ``black-box'' neural network models. To address these limitations, in this paper, we introduce Quant 4.0 and provide an engineering perspective for next-generation quant. Quant 4.0 has three key differentiating components. First, automated AI changes quant pipeline from traditional hand-craft modeling to the state-of-the-art automated modeling, practicing the philosophy of ``algorithm produces algorithm, model builds model, and eventually AI creates AI''. Second, explainable AI develops new techniques to better understand and interpret investment decisions made by machine learning black-boxes, and explains complicated and hidden risk exposures.

We rely on neural networks to represent supermartingale certificates that yield such probability bounds, which we compute using a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop: we train the neural certificate while tightening the probability bound over samples of the state space using stochastic optimisation, and then we formally check the certificate's validity over every possible state using satisfiability modulo theories; if we receive a counterexample, we add it to our set of samples and repeat the loop until validity is confirmed.

A statistical framework for planning and analysing test-retest studies   for repeatability of quantitative biomarker measurements,"Moritz Fabian Danzer, Maria Eveslage, Dennis Görlich, Benjamin Noto","There is an increasing number of potential biomarkers that could allow for early assessment of treatment response or disease progression. However, measurements of quantitative biomarkers are subject to random variability. Hence, differences of a biomarker in longitudinal measurements do not necessarily represent real change but might be caused by this random measurement variability. Before utilizing a quantitative biomarker in longitudinal studies, it is therefore essential to assess the measurement repeatability. Measurement repeatability obtained from test-retest studies can be quantified by the repeatability coefficient (RC), which is then used in the subsequent longitudinal study to determine if a measured difference represents real change or is within the range of expected random measurement variability. The quality of the point estimate of RC therefore directly governs the assessment quality of the longitudinal study. RC estimation accuracy depends on the case number in the test-retest study, but despite its pivotal role, no comprehensive framework for sample size calculation of test-retest studies exists. To address this issue, we have established such a framework, which allows for flexible sample size calculation of test-retest studies, based upon newly introduced criteria concerning assessment quality in the longitudinal study. This also permits retrospective assessment of prior test-retest studies.",2023-01-27T13:00:17Z,2023-01-27T13:00:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11690v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11690v1,"stat.ME, stat.AP, 62P10, G.3.3"
Modelling the artificial night sky brightness at short distances from   streetlights,"Salvador Bará, Carmen Bao-Varela, Miroslav Kocifaj","Contrary to some widespread intuitive belief, the night sky brightness perceived by the human eye or any other physical detector does not come (exclusively) from high in the sky. The detected brightness is built up from the scattered radiance contributed by all elementary atmospheric volumes along the line of sight, starting from the very first millimeter from the eye cornea or the entrance aperture of the measuring instrument. In artificially lit environments, nearby light sources may be responsible for a large share of the total perceived sky radiance. We present in this paper a quantitative analytical model for the sky radiance in the vicinity of outdoor light sources, free from singularities at the origin, which provides useful insights for the correct design or urban dark sky places. It is found that the artificial zenith sky brightness produced by a small ground-level source detected by a ground-level observer at short distances (from the typical dimension of the source up to several hundred meters) decays with the inverse of the distance to the source. This amounts to a reduction of 2.5 mag/arcsec2 in sky brightness for every log10 unit increase of the distance.

Linear-scaling kernels for protein sequences and small molecules   outperform deep learning while providing uncertainty quantitation and   improved interpretability,"Jonathan Parkinson, Wei Wang","Gaussian process (GP) is a Bayesian model which provides several advantages for regression tasks in machine learning such as reliable quantitation of uncertainty and improved interpretability. Their adoption has been precluded by their excessive computational cost and by the difficulty in adapting them for analyzing sequences (e.g. amino acid and nucleotide sequences) and graphs (e.g. ones representing small molecules). In this study, we develop efficient and scalable approaches for fitting GP models as well as fast convolution kernels which scale linearly with graph or sequence size. We implement these improvements by building an open-source Python library called xGPR. We compare the performance of xGPR with the reported performance of various deep learning models on 20 benchmarks, including small molecule, protein sequence and tabular data. We show that xGRP achieves highly competitive performance with much shorter training time. Furthermore, we also develop new kernels for sequence and graph data and show that xGPR generally outperforms convolutional neural networks on predicting key properties of proteins and small molecules. Importantly, xGPR provides uncertainty information not available from typical deep learning models. Additionally, xGPR provides a representation of the input data that can be used for clustering and data visualization.

Overflow metabolism originates from growth optimization and cell   heterogeneity,Xin Wang,"A classic problem in metabolism is that fast-proliferating cells use seemingly wasteful fermentation for energy biogenesis in the presence of sufficient oxygen. This counterintuitive phenomenon, known as overflow metabolism or the Warburg effect, is universal across various organisms. Despite extensive research, its origin and function remain unclear. Here, we show that overflow metabolism can be understood through growth optimization combined with cell heterogeneity. A model of optimal protein allocation, coupled with heterogeneity in enzyme catalytic rates among cells, quantitatively explains why and how cells choose between respiration and fermentation under different nutrient conditions.

Quantitative perfusion and water transport time model from multi b-value   diffusion magnetic resonance imaging validated against neutron capture   microspheres,"M. Liu, N. Saadat, Y. Jeong, S. Roth, M. Niekrasz, M. Giurcanu, T. Carroll, G. Christoforidis","Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) is a non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-based scan that uses a multitude of b-values to measure various speeds of molecular perfusion and diffusion, sidestepping inaccuracy of arterial input functions or bolus kinetics in quantitative imaging. We test a new method of IVIM quantification and compare our values to reference standard neutron capture microspheres across normocapnia, CO2 induced hypercapnia, and middle cerebral artery occlusion in a controlled animal model. Perfusion quantification in ml/100g/min compared to microsphere perfusion uses the 3D gaussian probability distribution and defined water transport time as when 50% of the molecules remain in the tissue of interest. Perfusion, water transport time, and infarct volume was compared to reference standards. Simulations were studied to suppress non-specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Linear regression analysis of quantitative perfusion returned correlation (slope = .55, intercept = 52.5, $R^2$= .64). Linear regression for water transport time asymmetry in infarcted tissue was excellent (slope = .59, intercept = .3, $R^2$ = .93). Strong linear agreement also was found for infarct volume (slope = 1.01, $R^2$= .79). Simulation of CSF suppression via inversion recovery returned blood signal reduced by 82% from combined T1 and T2 effects. Intra-physiologic state comparison of perfusion shows potential partial volume effects which require further study especially in disease states. The accuracy and sensitivity of IVIM provides evidence that observed signal changes reflect cytotoxic edema and tissue perfusion. Partial volume contamination of CSF may be better removed during post-processing rather than with inversion recovery to avoid artificial loss of blood signal.",2023-04-04T15:41:11Z,2023-04-04T15:41:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01888v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01888v1,"physics.med-ph, eess.IV"
Quantum enhanced non-interferometric quantitative phase imaging,"Giuseppe Ortolano, Alberto Paniate, Pauline Boucher, Carmine Napoli, Sarika Soman, Silvania F. Pereira, Ivano Ruo Berchera, Marco Genovese","Quantum entanglement and squeezing have significantly improved phase estimation and imaging in interferometric settings beyond the classical limits. However, for a wide class of non-interferometric phase imaging/retrieval methods vastly used in the classical domain e.g., ptychography and diffractive imaging, a demonstration of quantum advantage is still missing. Here, we fill this gap by exploiting entanglement to enhance imaging of a pure phase object in a non-interferometric setting, only measuring the phase effect on the free-propagating field. This method, based on the so-called ""transport of intensity equation"", is quantitative since it provides the absolute value of the phase without prior knowledge of the object and operates in wide-field mode, so it does not need time-consuming raster scanning. Moreover, it does not require spatial and temporal coherence of the incident light. Besides a general improvement of the image quality at a fixed number of photons irradiated through the object, resulting in better discrimination of small details, we demonstrate a clear reduction of the uncertainty in the quantitative phase estimation. Although we provide an experimental demonstration of a specific scheme in the visible spectrum, this research also paves the way for applications at different wavelengths, e.g., X-ray imaging, where reducing the photon dose is of utmost importance.",2023-04-28T09:55:31Z,2023-04-28T09:55:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14727v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14727v1,"quant-ph, physics.optics"
"Solution existence, uniqueness, and stability of discrete basis   sinograms in multispectral CT","Yu Gao, Xiaochuan Pan, Chong Chen","This work investigates conditions for quantitative image reconstruction in multispectral computed tomography (MSCT), which remains a topic of active research. In MSCT, one seeks to obtain from data the spatial distribution of linear attenuation coefficient, referred to as a virtual monochromatic image (VMI), at a given X-ray energy, within the subject imaged. As a VMI is decomposed often into a linear combination of basis images with known decomposition coefficients, the reconstruction of a VMI is thus tantamount to that of the basis images. An empirical, but highly effective, two-step data-domain-decomposition (DDD) method has been developed and used widely for quantitative image reconstruction in MSCT. In the two-step DDD method, step (1) estimates the so-called basis sinogram from data through solving a nonlinear transform, whereas step (2) reconstructs basis images from their basis sinograms estimated. Subsequently, a VMI can readily be obtained from the linear combination of basis images reconstructed. As step (2) involves the inversion of a straightforward linear system, step (1) is the key component of the DDD method in which a nonlinear system needs to be inverted for estimating the basis sinograms from data. In this work, we consider a {\it discrete} form of the nonlinear system in step (1), and then carry out theoretical and numerical analyses of conditions on the existence, uniqueness, and stability of a solution to the discrete nonlinear system for accurately estimating the discrete basis sinograms, leading to quantitative reconstruction of VMIs in MSCT.",2023-05-05T07:22:20Z,2023-05-05T07:22:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03330v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03330v1,"math.NA, cs.CV, cs.NA, physics.med-ph, 65R32, 94A08, 65F22, 65J22, 65D18"
Quantitative Methods for Optimizing Patient Outcomes in Liver   Transplantation,"Raja Al-Bahou, Julia Bruner, Helen Moore, Ali Zarrinpar","Liver transplantation continues to be the gold standard for treating patients with end-stage liver diseases. However, despite the huge success of liver transplantation in improving patient outcomes, long term graft survival continues to be a major problem. The current clinical practice in the management of liver transplant patients is centered around immunosuppressive multidrug regimens. Current research has been focusing on phenotypic personalized medicine as a novel approach in the optimization of immunosuppression, a regressional math modeling focusing on individual patient dose and response using specific markers like transaminases. A prospective area of study includes the development of a mechanistic computational math modeling for optimizing immunosuppression to improve patient outcomes and increase long-term graft survival by exploring the intricate immune/drug interactions to help us further our understanding and management of medical problems like transplants, autoimmunity, and cancer therapy. Thus, by increasing long-term graft survival, the need for redo transplants will decrease, which will free up organs and potentially help with the organ shortage problem promoting equity and equal opportunity for transplants, as well as decreasing the medical costs associated with additional testing and hospital admissions. Although long-term graft survival remains challenging, computational and quantitative methods have led to significant improvements. In this article, we review recent advances and remaining opportunities. We focus on the following topics: donor organ availability and allocation with a focus on equity, monitoring of patient and graft health, and optimization of immunosuppression dosing.",2023-05-31T16:45:44Z,2023-05-31T16:45:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00046v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00046v1,"q-bio.OT, 92B"
The structure-dynamics feedback mechanism governs the glassy dynamics in   epithelial monolayers,"Satyam Pandey, Soumitra Kolya, Padmashree Devendran, Souvik Sadhukhan, Tamal Das, Saroj Kumar Nandi","The glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers is crucial for several biological processes, such as wound healing, embryogenesis, cancer progression, etc. Several experiments have indicated that, unlike particulate systems, the glassy dynamics in these systems correlates with the static properties and shows a readily-found sub-Arrhenius relaxation. However, whether the statics-dynamics correlation is only qualitative or can provide quantitative predictions and what leads to the sub-Arrhenius relaxation remains unclear. We apply a particular analytical theory of glassy dynamics, the mode-coupling theory (MCT) that predicts dynamics using static properties alone as input, to the confluent systems. We demonstrate the remarkable applicability of MCT in simulations of the Vertex model and experiments on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells and show the quantitative nature of the structure-dynamics correlation in these systems. Our results elucidate that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism of MCT, and not the barrier crossing mechanism, dominates the glassy dynamics in these systems where the relaxation time diverges as a power law with a universal exponent of $3/2$. This slower-than-exponential divergence naturally explains the sub-Arrhenius relaxation dynamics in these systems. The quantitative nature of the structure-dynamics correlation also suggests the possibility of describing various complex biological processes, such as cell division and apoptosis, via the static properties of the systems, such as cell shape or shape variability.",2023-06-12T17:20:27Z,2024-07-23T10:21:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07250v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07250v2,"cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph"

The current description and quantification of features on pathology slides are limited, prompting the need for innovative solutions to comprehensively assess diverse phenotypic attributes within Whole Slide Images (WSIs). In particular, understanding the morphological characteristics of podocytes, terminally differentiated glomerular epithelial cells, is crucial for studying glomerular injury. This paper introduces the Spatial Pathomics Toolkit (SPT) and applies it to podocyte pathomics. The SPT consists of three main components: (1) instance object segmentation, enabling precise identification of podocyte nuclei; (2) pathomics feature generation, extracting a comprehensive array of quantitative features from the identified nuclei; and (3) robust statistical analyses, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of spatial relationships between morphological and spatial transcriptomics features.The SPT successfully extracted and analyzed morphological and textural features from podocyte nuclei, revealing a multitude of podocyte morphomic features through statistical analysis. Additionally, we demonstrated the SPT's ability to unravel spatial information inherent to podocyte distribution, shedding light on spatial patterns associated with glomerular injury. By disseminating the SPT, our goal is to provide the research community with a powerful and user-friendly resource that advances cellular spatial pathomics in renal pathology.

Flashpoints Signal Hidden Inherent Instabilities in Land-Use Planning,"Hazhir Aliahmadi, Maeve Beckett, Sam Connolly, Dongmei Chen, Greg van Anders","Land-use decision-making processes have a long history of producing globally pervasive systemic equity and sustainability concerns. Quantitative, optimization-based planning approaches, e.g. Multi-Objective Land Allocation (MOLA), seemingly open the possibility to improve objectivity and transparency by explicitly evaluating planning priorities by the type, amount, and location of land uses. Here, we show that optimization-based planning approaches with generic planning criteria generate a series of unstable ""flashpoints"" whereby tiny changes in planning priorities produce large-scale changes in the amount of land use by type. We give quantitative arguments that the flashpoints we uncover in MOLA models are examples of a more general family of instabilities that occur whenever planning accounts for factors that coordinate use on- and between-sites, regardless of whether these planning factors are formulated explicitly or implicitly. We show that instabilities lead to regions of ambiguity in land-use type that we term ""gray areas"". By directly mapping gray areas between flashpoints, we show that quantitative methods retain utility by reducing combinatorially large spaces of possible land-use patterns to a small, characteristic set that can engage stakeholders to arrive at more efficient and just outcomes.",2023-08-15T11:47:16Z,2023-08-15T11:47:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07714v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07714v1,"cs.AI, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.CE, physics.soc-ph"
Structural Cycle GAN for Virtual Immunohistochemistry Staining of Gland   Markers in the Colon,"Shikha Dubey, Tushar Kataria, Beatrice Knudsen, Shireen Y. Elhabian","With the advent of digital scanners and deep learning, diagnostic operations may move from a microscope to a desktop. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is one of the most frequently used stains for disease analysis, diagnosis, and grading, but pathologists do need different immunohistochemical (IHC) stains to analyze specific structures or cells. Obtaining all of these stains (H&E and different IHCs) on a single specimen is a tedious and time-consuming task. Consequently, virtual staining has emerged as an essential research direction. Here, we propose a novel generative model, Structural Cycle-GAN (SC-GAN), for synthesizing IHC stains from H&E images, and vice versa. Our method expressly incorporates structural information in the form of edges (in addition to color data) and employs attention modules exclusively in the decoder of the proposed generator model. This integration enhances feature localization and preserves contextual information during the generation process. In addition, a structural loss is incorporated to ensure accurate structure alignment between the generated and input markers. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model, experiments are conducted with two IHC markers emphasizing distinct structures of glands in the colon: the nucleus of epithelial cells (CDX2) and the cytoplasm (CK818). Quantitative metrics such as FID and SSIM are frequently used for the analysis of generative models, but they do not correlate explicitly with higher-quality virtual staining results. Therefore, we propose two new quantitative metrics that correlate directly with the virtual staining specificity of IHC markers.",2023-08-25T05:24:23Z,2023-08-25T05:24:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13182v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13182v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.QM"

Synthetic CT Generation via Variant Invertible Network for All-digital   Brain PET Attenuation Correction,"Yu Guan, Bohui Shen, Xinchong Shi, Xiangsong Zhang, Bingxuan Li, Qiegen Liu","Attenuation correction (AC) is essential for the generation of artifact-free and quantitatively accurate positron emission tomography (PET) images. However, AC of PET faces challenges including inter-scan motion and erroneous transformation of structural voxel-intensities to PET attenuation-correction factors. Nowadays, the problem of AC for quantitative PET have been solved to a large extent after the commercial availability of devices combining PET with computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, considering the feasibility of a deep learning approach for PET AC without anatomical imaging, this paper develops a PET AC method, which uses deep learning to generate continuously valued CT images from non-attenuation corrected PET images for AC on brain PET imaging. Specifically, an invertible network combined with the variable augmentation strategy that can achieve the bidirectional inference processes is proposed for synthetic CT generation (IVNAC). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conducted a comprehensive study on a total of 1440 data from 37 clinical patients using comparative algorithms (such as Cycle-GAN and Pix2pix). Perceptual analysis and quantitative evaluations illustrate that the invertible network for PET AC outperforms other existing AC models, which demonstrates the potential of the proposed method and the feasibility of achieving brain PET AC without CT.",2023-10-03T08:38:52Z,2023-10-03T08:38:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01885v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01885v1,"eess.IV, cs.LG, q-bio.NC"
Quantitative passive imaging by iterative holography: The example of   helioseismic holography,"Björn Müller, Thorsten Hohage, Damien Fournier, Laurent Gizon","In passive imaging, one attempts to reconstruct some coefficients in a wave equation from correlations of observed randomly excited solutions to this wave equation. Many methods proposed for this class of inverse problem so far are only qualitative, e.g., trying to identify the support of a perturbation. Major challenges are the increase in dimensionality when computing correlations from primary data in a preprocessing step, and often very poor pointwise signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose an approach that addresses both of these challenges: It works only on the primary data while implicitly using the full information contained in the correlation data, and it provides quantitative estimates and convergence by iteration.   Our work is motivated by helioseismic holography, a well-established imaging method to map heterogenities and flows in the solar interior. We show that the back-propagation used in classical helioseismic holography can be interpreted as the adjoint of the Fr\'echet derivative of the operator which maps the properties of the solar interior to the correlation data on the solar surface. The theoretical and numerical framework for passive imaging problems developed in this paper extends helioseismic holography to nonlinear problems and allows for quantitative reconstructions.

But as research moves to atomic scales, meeting these requirements gets harder, often needing high - precision motion control and manual pre - calibration. This paper presents a new imaging framework. By adding a wavefront modulator and a new phase retrieval workflow, it removes the strict requirements of traditional ptychography. Significantly, our method doesn't need pre - calibration of the wavefront modulator. Optical validation showed the deviation between the recovered position and a top - tier motion stage was less than 10 nm. Sub - pixel position accuracy was achievable even with a 13% overlap ratio. In an X - ray experiment with a spatially unstable probe violating the ptychographic model and an 18% overlap ratio, our method simultaneously and quantitatively retrieved beam spatial deviation, scan position, probe function, and sample transmission function. Notably, it measured probe spatial deviations of 500nm along the X - axis and 50nm along the Y - axis, which is not feasible by previous methods.

In this paper we present a proof of concept, showing that the structural information stabilises far earlier than the quantitative knowledge. Additionally, we show experimentally that the structural information can be kept unmodified when re-training the AI system with new samples while still achieving a validation accuracy similar to that obtained when re-training a neural network with similar size.

In particular, we prove the following qualitative form of Landis conjecture, for $W_1, W_2 \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb R^2;\mathbb R^2)$, $V \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb R^2;\mathbb R)$ and $u \in H_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1}(\mathbb R^2)$ a real-valued weak solution to $-\Delta u - \nabla \cdot ( W_1 u ) +W_2 \cdot \nabla u + V u = 0$ in $\mathbb R^2$, satisfying for $\delta>0$, $|u(x)| \leq \exp(- |x|^{1+\delta})$, $x \in \mathbb R^2$, then $u \equiv 0$. Our methodology of proof is inspired by the one recently developed by Logunov, Malinnikova, Nadirashvili, and Nazarov that have treated the equation $-\Delta u + V u = 0$ in $\mathbb R^2$. Nevertheless, several differences and additional difficulties appear. New weak quantitative maximum principles are established for the construction of a positive multiplier in a suitable perforated domain, depending on the nodal set of $u$. The resulted divergence elliptic equation is then transformed into a non-homogeneous $\partial_{\overline{z}}$ equation thanks to a generalization of Stoilow factorization theorem obtained by the theory of quasiconformal mappings, an approximate type Poincar\'e lemma and the use of the Cauchy transform. Finally, a suitable Carleman estimate applied to the operator $\partial_{\overline{z}}$ is the last ingredient of our proof.",2023-12-31T09:45:09Z,2023-12-31T09:45:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00441v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00441v1,"math.AP, math.CA, math.CV, 35B60, 35J15, 30C62"
Quantitative Analysis of Molecular Transport in the Extracellular Space   Using Physics-Informed Neural Network,"Jiayi Xie, Hongfeng Li, Jin Cheng, Qingrui Cai, Hanbo Tan, Lingyun Zu, Xiaobo Qu, Hongbin Han","The brain extracellular space (ECS), an irregular, extremely tortuous nanoscale space located between cells or between cells and blood vessels, is crucial for nerve cell survival. It plays a pivotal role in high-level brain functions such as memory, emotion, and sensation. However, the specific form of molecular transport within the ECS remain elusive. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to quantitatively analyze the molecular transport within the ECS by solving an inverse problem derived from the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). PINN provides a streamlined solution to the ADE without the need for intricate mathematical formulations or grid settings. Additionally, the optimization of PINN facilitates the automatic computation of the diffusion coefficient governing long-term molecule transport and the velocity of molecules driven by advection. Consequently, the proposed method allows for the quantitative analysis and identification of the specific pattern of molecular transport within the ECS through the calculation of the Peclet number. Experimental validation on two datasets of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) captured at different time points showcases the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, our simulations reveal identical molecular transport patterns between datasets representing rats with tracer injected into the same brain region. These findings highlight the potential of PINN as a promising tool for comprehensively exploring molecular transport within the ECS.",2024-01-23T02:04:15Z,2024-01-24T02:31:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12435v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12435v2,"cs.AI, cs.LG, math.AP"
Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy   toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity,"Shunsuke Nishimura, Moeta Tsukamoto, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi","Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 {\mu}m thick, and a resolution of 1 {\mu}m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 {\mu}m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM.",2024-02-22T10:10:25Z,2024-02-22T10:10:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14422v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14422v1,"physics.optics, cond-mat.other"
From Displacements to Distributions: A Machine-Learning Enabled   Framework for Quantifying Uncertainties in Parameters of Computational Models,"Taylor Roper, Harri Hakula, Troy Butler","This work presents novel extensions for combining two frameworks for quantifying both aleatoric (i.e., irreducible) and epistemic (i.e., reducible) sources of uncertainties in the modeling of engineered systems. The data-consistent (DC) framework poses an inverse problem and solution for quantifying aleatoric uncertainties in terms of pullback and push-forward measures for a given Quantity of Interest (QoI) map. Unfortunately, a pre-specified QoI map is not always available a priori to the collection of data associated with system outputs. The data themselves are often polluted with measurement errors (i.e., epistemic uncertainties), which complicates the process of specifying a useful QoI. The Learning Uncertain Quantities (LUQ) framework defines a formal three-step machine-learning enabled process for transforming noisy datasets into samples of a learned QoI map to enable DC-based inversion. We develop a robust filtering step in LUQ that can learn the most useful quantitative information present in spatio-temporal datasets. The learned QoI map transforms simulated and observed datasets into distributions to perform DC-based inversion. We also develop a DC-based inversion scheme that iterates over time as new spatial datasets are obtained and utilizes quantitative diagnostics to identify both the quality and impact of inversion at each iteration. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space theory is leveraged to mathematically analyze the learned QoI map and develop a quantitative sufficiency test for evaluating the filtered data. An illustrative example is utilized throughout while the final two examples involve the manufacturing of shells of revolution to demonstrate various aspects of the presented frameworks.",2024-03-04T20:40:50Z,2024-03-04T20:40:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03233v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03233v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, 28A50, 60-04, 60-08"
Measuring Robustness in Cyber-Physical Systems under Sensor Attacks,"Jian Xiang, Ruggero Lanotte, Simone Tini, Stephen Chong, Massimo Merro","This paper contributes a formal framework for quantitative analysis of bounded sensor attacks on cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of differential dynamic logic. Given a precondition and postcondition of a system, we formalize two quantitative safety notions, quantitative forward and backward safety, which respectively express (1) how strong the strongest postcondition of the system is with respect to the specified postcondition, and (2) how strong the specified precondition is with respect to the weakest precondition of the system needed to ensure the specified postcondition holds. We introduce two notions, forward and backward robustness, to characterize the robustness of a system against sensor attacks as the loss of safety. To reason about robustness, we introduce two simulation distances, forward and backward simulation distances, which are defined based on the behavioral distances between the original system and the system with compromised sensors. Forward and backward distances, respectively, characterize upper bounds of the degree of forward and backward safety loss caused by the sensor attacks. We verify the two simulation distances by expressing them as modalities, i.e., formulas of differential dynamic logic, and develop an ad-hoc proof system to reason with such formulas. We showcase our formal notions and reasoning techniques on two non-trivial case studies: an autonomous vehicle that needs to avoid collision and a water tank system.",2024-03-09T07:47:29Z,2024-03-09T07:47:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05829v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05829v1,"eess.SY, cs.CR, cs.ET, cs.LO, cs.SY"
A Modified da Vinci Surgical Instrument for OCE based Elasticity   Estimation with Deep Learning,"Maximilian Neidhardt, Robin Mieling, Sarah Latus, Martin Fischer, Tobias Maurer, Alexander Schlaefer","Robot-assisted surgery has advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic procedures, e.g., precise movement of the surgical instruments, improved dexterity, and high-resolution visualization of the surgical field. However, mechanical tissue properties may provide additional information, e.g., on the location of lesions or vessels. While elastographic imaging has been proposed, it is not readily available as an online modality during robot-assisted surgery. We propose modifying a da~Vinci surgical instrument to realize optical coherence elastography (OCE) for quantitative elasticity estimation. The modified da~Vinci instrument is equipped with piezoelectric elements for shear wave excitation and we employ fast optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to track propagating wave fields, which are directly related to biomechanical tissue properties. All high-voltage components are mounted at the proximal end outside the patient. We demonstrate that external excitation at the instrument shaft can effectively stimulate shear waves, even when considering damping. Comparing conventional and deep learning-based signal processing, resulting in mean absolute errors of 19.27 kPa and 6.29 kPa, respectively. These results illustrate that precise quantitative elasticity estimates can be obtained. We also demonstrate quantitative elasticity estimation on ex-vivo tissue samples of heart, liver and stomach, and show that the measurements can be used to distinguish soft and stiff tissue types.",2024-03-14T10:27:38Z,2025-01-27T16:44:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09256v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09256v2,"eess.IV, cs.SY, eess.SY"

We extract from our experimental data a Rabi splitting of 81 meV, and an experimental effective polariton loss of 55 meV, demonstrating that our system is in the strong-coupling regime. Furthermore, we measure for the first time at visible wavelengths the propagation length of these EPPs for each excitation energy of the dispersion relation. To demonstrate the quantitative nature of our near-field method to obtain the full complex-valued wavevector of EPPs, we use our near-field measurements to predict, via the transfer matrix method, the far-field reflectivities across the exciton resonance.

A quantitative theory for heterogeneous combustion of nonvolatile metal   particles in the diffusion-limited regime,"Daoguan Ning, Andreas Dreizler","The paper presents an analytical theory quantitatively describing the heterogeneous combustion of nonvolatile (metal) particles in the diffusion-limited regime. It is assumed that the particle is suspended in an unconfined, isobaric, quiescent gaseous mixture and the chemisorption of the oxygen takes place evenly on the particle surface. The exact solution of the particle burn time is derived from the conservation equations of the gas-phase described in a spherical coordinate system with the utilization of constant thermophysical properties, evaluated at a reference film layer. This solution inherently takes the Stefan flow into account. The approximate expression of the time-dependent particle temperature is solved from the conservation of the particle enthalpy by neglecting the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the product of the transient particle density and diameter squared. Coupling the solutions for the burn time and time-dependent particle temperature provides quantitative results when initial and boundary conditions are specified. The theory is employed to predict the burn time and temperature of micro-sized iron particles, which are then compared with measurements, as the first validation case. The theoretical burn time agrees with the experiments almost perfectly at both low and high oxygen levels. The calculated particle temperature matches the measurements fairly well at relatively low oxygen mole fractions, whereas the theory overpredict the particle peak temperature due to the neglect of evaporation and the possible transition of the combustion regime.",2024-04-25T08:47:52Z,2024-04-25T08:47:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16415v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16415v1,"physics.flu-dyn, math-ph, math.MP"
ATOMMIC: An Advanced Toolbox for Multitask Medical Imaging Consistency   to facilitate Artificial Intelligence applications from acquisition to   analysis in Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Dimitrios Karkalousos, Ivana Išgum, Henk A.

Advanced AI frameworks have been developed to apply AI in various successive tasks, such as image reconstruction, quantitative parameter map estimation, and image segmentation. Existing frameworks are often designed to perform tasks independently or are focused on specific models or datasets, limiting generalization. We introduce ATOMMIC, an open-source toolbox that streamlines AI applications for accelerated MRI reconstruction and analysis. ATOMMIC implements several tasks using DL networks and enables MultiTask Learning (MTL) to perform related tasks integrated, targeting generalization in the MRI domain. We first review the current state of AI frameworks for MRI through a comprehensive literature search and by parsing 12,479 GitHub repositories. We benchmark 25 DL models on eight publicly available datasets to present distinct applications of ATOMMIC on accelerated MRI reconstruction, image segmentation, quantitative parameter map estimation, and joint accelerated MRI reconstruction and image segmentation utilizing MTL. Our findings demonstrate that ATOMMIC is the only MTL framework with harmonized complex-valued and real-valued data support. Evaluations on single tasks show that physics-based models, which enforce data consistency by leveraging the physical properties of MRI, outperform other models in reconstructing highly accelerated acquisitions. Physics-based models that produce high reconstruction quality can accurately estimate quantitative parameter maps. When high-performing reconstruction models are combined with robust segmentation networks utilizing MTL, performance is improved in both tasks. ATOMMIC facilitates MRI reconstruction and analysis by standardizing workflows, enhancing data interoperability, integrating unique features like MTL, and effectively benchmarking DL models.",2024-04-30T16:00:21Z,2024-04-30T16:00:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19665v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19665v1,"physics.med-ph, cs.AI, cs.SE, math-ph, math.MP"
Illumination Histogram Consistency Metric for Quantitative Assessment of   Video Sequences,"Long Chen, Mobarakol Islam, Matt Clarkson, Thomas Dowrick","The advances in deep generative models have greatly accelerate the process of video procession such as video enhancement and synthesis. Learning spatio-temporal video models requires to capture the temporal dynamics of a scene, in addition to the visual appearance of individual frames. Illumination consistency, which reflects the variations of illumination in the dynamic video sequences, play a vital role in video processing. Unfortunately, to date, no well-accepted quantitative metric has been proposed for video illumination consistency evaluation. In this paper, we propose a illumination histogram consistency (IHC) metric to quantitatively and automatically evaluate the illumination consistency of the video sequences. IHC measures the illumination variation of any video sequence based on the illumination histogram discrepancies across all the frames in the video sequence. Specifically, given a video sequence, we first estimate the illumination map of each individual frame using the Retinex model; Then, using the illumination maps, the mean illumination histogram of the video sequence is computed by the mean operation across all the frames; Next, we compute the illumination histogram discrepancy between each individual frame and the mean illumination histogram and sum up all the illumination histogram discrepancies to represent the illumination variations of the video sequence. Finally, we obtain the IHC score from the illumination histogram discrepancies via normalization and subtraction operations. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed IHC metric and its capability to measure the illumination variations in video sequences.

A Survey of Unikernel Security: Insights and Trends from a Quantitative   Analysis,"Alex Wollman, John Hastings","Unikernels, an evolution of LibOSs, are emerging as a virtualization technology to rival those currently used by cloud providers. Unikernels combine the user and kernel space into one ""uni""fied memory space and omit functionality that is not necessary for its application to run, thus drastically reducing the required resources. The removed functionality however is far-reaching and includes components that have become common security technologies such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), and Non-executable bits (NX bits). This raises questions about the real-world security of unikernels. This research presents a quantitative methodology using TF-IDF to analyze the focus of security discussions within unikernel research literature. Based on a corpus of 33 unikernel-related papers spanning 2013-2023, our analysis found that Memory Protection Extensions and Data Execution Prevention were the least frequently occurring topics, while SGX was the most frequent topic. The findings quantify priorities and assumptions in unikernel security research, bringing to light potential risks from underexplored attack surfaces.

Cell divisions imprint long lasting elastic strain fields in epithelial   tissues,"Ali Tahaei, Romina Pisticello-Gómez, S Suganthan, Greta Cwikla, Jana F. Fuhrmann, Natalie A. Dye, Marko Popović","A hallmark of biological tissues, viewed as complex cellular materials, is the active generation of mechanical stresses by cellular processes, such as cell divisions. Each cellular event generates a force dipole that deforms the surrounding tissue. Therefore, a quantitative description of these force dipoles, and their consequences on tissue mechanics, is one of the central problems in understanding the overall tissue mechanics. In this work we analyze previously published experimental data on fruit fly \textit{D. melanogaster} wing epithelia to quantitatively describe the deformation fields induced by a cell-scale force dipole. We find that the measured deformation field can be explained by a simple model of fly epithelium as a linearly elastic sheet. This fact allows us to use measurements of the strain field around cellular events, such as cell divisions, to infer the magnitude and dynamics of the mechanical forces they generate. In particular, we find that cell divisions exert a transient isotropic force dipole field, corresponding to the temporary localisation of the cell nucleus to the tissue surface during the division, and traceless-symmetric force dipole field that remains detectable from the tissue strain field for up to about $3.5$ hours after the division. This is the timescale on which elastic strains are erased by other mechanical processes and therefore it corresponds to the tissue fluidization timescale. In summary, we have developed a method to infer force dipoles induced by cell divisions, by observing the strain field in the surrounding tissues. Using this method we quantitatively characterize mechanical forces generated during a cell division, and their effects on the tissue mechanics.",2024-06-05T16:30:30Z,2024-06-05T16:30:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03433v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03433v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft"
On Quantifiers for Quantitative Reasoning,Matteo Capucci,"We explore a kind of first-order predicate logic with intended semantics in the reals. Compared to other approaches in the literature, we work predominantly in the multiplicative reals $[0,\infty]$, showing they support three generations of connectives, that we call non-linear, linear additive, and linear multiplicative. Means and harmonic means emerge as natural candidates for bounded existential and universal quantifiers, and in fact we see they behave as expected in relation to the other logical connectives. We explain this fact through the well-known fact that min/max and arithmetic mean/harmonic mean sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, that of p-means. We give syntax and semantics for this quantitative predicate logic, and as example applications, we show how softmax is the quantitative semantics of argmax, and R\'enyi entropy/Hill numbers are additive/multiplicative semantics of the same formula. Indeed, the additive reals also fit into the story by exploiting the Napierian duality $-\log \dashv 1/\exp$, which highlights a formal distinction between 'additive' and 'multiplicative' quantities. Finally, we describe two attempts at a categorical semantics via enriched hyperdoctrines. We discuss why hyperdoctrines are in fact probably inadequate for this kind of logic.",2024-06-07T13:44:55Z,2025-01-21T07:45:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04936v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04936v5,"math.LO, cs.LO, 03C90 (Primary) 03B52 (Secondary)"
A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in   finite populations,Ananda Shikhara Bhat,"Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modeling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories.

To this end, fluorescence imaging and fibre-based probes have enabled more precise demarcation between the cancerous and healthy tissues. These sensing approaches, which rely on collecting the fluorescence light from the tumour resection site and its remote spectral sensing, introduce challenges associated with optical losses. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of tumour detection at the resection site using a miniature fluorescence measurement system. Unlike the current bulky systems, which necessitate remote measurement, we have adopted a millimetre-sized spectral sensor chip for quantitative fluorescence measurements. A reliable measurement at the resection site requires a stable optical window between the tissue and the optoelectronic system. This is achieved using an antifouling diamond window, which provides stable optical transparency. The system achieved a sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 98.3% in detecting a surrogate tumour at a resolution of 1 x 1 mm2.

Comparing AI versus Optimization Workflows for Simulation-Based   Inference of Spatial-Stochastic Systems,"Michael A. Ramirez-Sierra, Thomas R. Sokolowski","Model parameter inference is a universal problem across science. This challenge is particularly pronounced in developmental biology, where faithful mechanistic descriptions require spatial-stochastic models with numerous parameters, yet quantitative empirical data often lack sufficient granularity due to experimental limitations. Parameterizing such complex models thus necessitates methods that elaborate on classical Bayesian inference by incorporating notions of optimality and goal-orientation through low-dimensional objective functions that quantitatively capture the target behavior of the underlying system. In this study, we contrast two such inference workflows and apply them to biophysics-inspired spatial-stochastic models. Technically, both workflows are simulation-based inference (SBI) methods. The first method leverages a modern deep-learning technique known as sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), while the second is based on a classical optimization technique called simulated annealing (SA). We evaluate these workflows by inferring the parameters of two complementary models for the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage differentiation in the blastocyst-stage mouse embryo. This developmental biology system serves as a paradigmatic example of a highly robust and reproducible cell-fate proportioning process that self-organizes under strongly stochastic conditions, such as intrinsic biochemical noise and cell-cell signaling delays. Our results indicate that while both methods largely agree in their predictions, the modern SBI workflow provides substantially richer inferred distributions at an equivalent computational cost. We identify the computational scenarios that favor the modern SBI method over its classical counterpart. Finally, we propose a plausible approach to integrate these two methods, thereby synergistically exploiting their parameter space exploration capabilities.",2024-07-15T17:37:03Z,2024-07-15T17:37:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10938v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10938v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"

The reconstruction of quantitative maps requires tailored algorithms for removing aliasing artefacts from the compressed sampled MRF acquisitions. Within approaches found in the literature, many focus solely on two-dimensional (2D) image reconstruction, neglecting the extension to volumetric (3D) scans despite their higher relevance and clinical value. A reason for this is that transitioning to 3D imaging without appropriate mitigations presents significant challenges, including increased computational cost and storage requirements, and the need for large amount of ground-truth (artefact-free) data for training. To address these issues, we introduce StoDIP, a new algorithm that extends the ground-truth-free Deep Image Prior (DIP) reconstruction to 3D MRF imaging. StoDIP employs memory-efficient stochastic updates across the multicoil MRF data, a carefully selected neural network architecture, as well as faster nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) transformations. This enables a faster convergence compared against a conventional DIP implementation without these features.

Fast Whole-Brain MR Multi-Parametric Mapping with Scan-Specific   Self-Supervised Networks,"Amir Heydari, Abbas Ahmadi, Tae Hyung Kim, Berkin Bilgic","Quantification of tissue parameters using MRI is emerging as a powerful tool in clinical diagnosis and research studies. The need for multiple long scans with different acquisition parameters prohibits quantitative MRI from reaching widespread adoption in routine clinical and research exams. Accelerated parameter mapping techniques leverage parallel imaging, signal modelling and deep learning to offer more practical quantitative MRI acquisitions. However, the achievable acceleration and the quality of maps are often limited. Joint MAPLE is a recent state-of-the-art multi-parametric and scan-specific parameter mapping technique with promising performance at high acceleration rates. It synergistically combines parallel imaging, model-based and machine learning approaches for joint mapping of T1, T2*, proton density and the field inhomogeneity. However, Joint MAPLE suffers from prohibitively long reconstruction time to estimate the maps from a multi-echo, multi-flip angle (MEMFA) dataset at high resolution in a scan-specific manner. In this work, we propose a faster version of Joint MAPLE which retains the mapping performance of the original version. Coil compression, random slice selection, parameter-specific learning rates and transfer learning are synergistically combined in the proposed framework. It speeds-up the reconstruction time up to 700 times than the original version and processes a whole-brain MEMFA dataset in 21 minutes on average, which originally requires ~260 hours for Joint MAPLE.

But even if the same properties are used, the image pre-processing techniques may differ and often researchers use their own customized scripts to calculate the image properties. To provide greater accessibility and comparability of research results in visual experimental aesthetics, we developed an open-access and easy-to-use toolbox (called the 'Aesthetics Toolbox'). The Toolbox allows users to calculate a well-defined set of quantitative image properties popular in contemporary research. The properties include lightness and color statistics, Fourier spectral properties, fractality, self-similarity, symmetry, as well as different entropy measures and CNN-based variances. Compatible with most devices, the Toolbox provides an intuitive click-and-drop web interface. In the Toolbox, we integrated the original scripts of four different research groups and translated them into Python 3. To ensure that results were consistent across analyses, we took care that results from the Python versions of the scripts were the same as those from the original scripts. The toolbox, detailed documentation, and a link to the cloud version are available via Github: https://github.com/RBartho/Aesthetics-Toolbox. In summary, we developed a toolbox that helps to standardize and simplify the calculation of quantitative image properties for visual aesthetics research.",2024-08-20T07:49:43Z,2024-08-20T07:49:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10616v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10616v1,"cs.CV, stat.AP"
Full-Field Quantitative Visualization of Shock-Driven Pore Collapse and   Failure Modes in PMMA,"Barry P Lawlor, Vatsa Gandhi, Guruswami Ravichandran","The dynamic collapse of pores under shock loading is thought to be directly related to hot spot generation and material failure, which is critical to the performance of porous energetic and structural materials. However, the shock compression response of porous materials at the local, individual pore scale is not well understood. This study examines, quantitatively, the collapse phenomenon of a single spherical void in PMMA at shock stresses ranging from 0.4-1.0 GPa. Using a newly developed internal digital image correlation technique in conjunction with plate impact experiments, full-field quantitative deformation measurements are conducted in the material surrounding the collapsing pore for the first time. The experimental results reveal two failure mode transitions as shock stress is increased: (i) the first in-situ evidence of shear localization via adiabatic shear banding and (ii) dynamic fracture initiation at the pore surface. Numerical simulations using thermo-viscoplastic dynamic finite element analysis provide insights into the formation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) and stresses at which failure mode transitions occur. Further numerical and theoretical modeling indicates the dynamic fracture to occur along the weakened material inside an adiabatic shear band. Finally, analysis of the evolution of pore asymmetry and models for ASB spacing elucidate the mechanisms for the shear band initiation sites, and elastostatic theory explains the experimentally observed ASB and fracture paths based on the directions of maximum shear.",2024-08-29T22:13:55Z,2024-08-29T22:13:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16931v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16931v1,"physics.app-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Balancing Optimality and Diversity: Human-Centered Decision Making   through Generative Curation,"Michael Lingzhi Li, Shixiang Zhu","The surge in data availability has inundated decision-makers with an overwhelming array of choices. While existing approaches focus on optimizing decisions based on quantifiable metrics, practical decision-making often requires balancing measurable quantitative criteria with unmeasurable qualitative factors embedded in the broader context. In such cases, algorithms can generate high-quality recommendations, but the final decision rests with the human, who must weigh both dimensions. We define the process of selecting the optimal set of algorithmic recommendations in this context as human-centered decision making. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework called generative curation, which optimizes the true desirability of decision options by integrating both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Our framework uses a Gaussian process to model unknown qualitative factors and derives a diversity metric that balances quantitative optimality with qualitative diversity. This trade-off enables the generation of a manageable subset of diverse, near-optimal actions that are robust to unknown qualitative preferences. To operationalize this framework, we propose two implementation approaches: a generative neural network architecture that produces a distribution $\pi$ to efficiently sample a diverse set of near-optimal actions, and a sequential optimization method to iteratively generates solutions that can be easily incorporated into complex optimization formulations. We validate our approach with extensive datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing decision-making processes across a range of complex environments, with significant implications for policy and management.",2024-09-17T20:13:32Z,2024-09-17T20:13:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11535v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11535v1,"cs.LG, cs.HC, math.OC"
Towards the Discovery of Down Syndrome Brain Biomarkers Using Generative   Models,"Jordi Malé, Juan Fortea, Mateus Rozalem Aranha, Yann Heuzé, Neus Martínez-Abadías, Xavier Sevillano","Brain imaging has allowed neuroscientists to analyze brain morphology in genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Down syndrome, pinpointing regions of interest to unravel the neuroanatomical underpinnings of cognitive impairment and memory deficits. However, the connections between brain anatomy, cognitive performance and comorbidities like Alzheimer's disease are still poorly understood in the Down syndrome population. The latest advances in artificial intelligence constitute an opportunity for developing automatic tools to analyze large volumes of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, overcoming the bottleneck of manual analysis. In this study, we propose the use of generative models for detecting brain alterations in people with Down syndrome affected by various degrees of neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer's disease. To that end, we evaluate state-of-the-art brain anomaly detection models based on Variational Autoencoders and Diffusion Models, leveraging a proprietary dataset of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, our study includes several key analyses. First, we conducted a qualitative evaluation by expert neuroradiologists. Second, we performed both quantitative and qualitative reconstruction fidelity studies for the generative models. Third, we carried out an ablation study to examine how the incorporation of histogram post-processing can enhance model performance. Finally, we executed a quantitative volumetric analysis of subcortical structures. Our findings indicate that some models effectively detect the primary alterations characterizing Down syndrome's brain anatomy, including a smaller cerebellum, enlarged ventricles, and cerebral cortex reduction, as well as the parietal lobe alterations caused by Alzheimer's disease.",2024-09-20T12:01:15Z,2024-09-20T12:01:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13437v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13437v1,"cs.CV, q-bio.QM"
Volumetric Conditional Score-based Residual Diffusion Model for PET/MR   Denoising,"Siyeop Yoon, Rui Hu, Yuang Wang, Matthew Tivnan, Young-don Son, Dufan Wu, Xiang Li, Kyungsang Kim, Quanzheng Li","PET imaging is a powerful modality offering quantitative assessments of molecular and physiological processes. The necessity for PET denoising arises from the intrinsic high noise levels in PET imaging, which can significantly hinder the accurate interpretation and quantitative analysis of the scans. With advances in deep learning techniques, diffusion model-based PET denoising techniques have shown remarkable performance improvement. However, these models often face limitations when applied to volumetric data. Additionally, many existing diffusion models do not adequately consider the unique characteristics of PET imaging, such as its 3D volumetric nature, leading to the potential loss of anatomic consistency. Our Conditional Score-based Residual Diffusion (CSRD) model addresses these issues by incorporating a refined score function and 3D patch-wise training strategy, optimizing the model for efficient volumetric PET denoising. The CSRD model significantly lowers computational demands and expedites the denoising process. By effectively integrating volumetric data from PET and MRI scans, the CSRD model maintains spatial coherence and anatomical detail. Lastly, we demonstrate that the CSRD model achieves superior denoising performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while maintaining image details and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",2024-09-30T19:35:22Z,2024-09-30T19:35:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00184v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00184v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG"
Transfer Learning in Vocal Education: Technical Evaluation of Limited   Samples Describing Mezzo-soprano,"Zhenyi Hou, Xu Zhao, Kejie Ye, Xinyu Sheng, Shanggerile Jiang, Jiajing Xia, Yitao Zhang, Chenxi Ban, Daijun Luo, Jiaxing Chen, Yan Zou, Yuchao Feng, Guangyu Fan, Xin Yuan","Vocal education in the music field is difficult to quantify due to the individual differences in singers' voices and the different quantitative criteria of singing techniques. Deep learning has great potential to be applied in music education due to its efficiency to handle complex data and perform quantitative analysis. However, accurate evaluations with limited samples over rare vocal types, such as Mezzo-soprano, requires extensive well-annotated data support using deep learning models. In order to attain the objective, we perform transfer learning by employing deep learning models pre-trained on the ImageNet and Urbansound8k datasets for the improvement on the precision of vocal technique evaluation. Furthermore, we tackle the problem of the lack of samples by constructing a dedicated dataset, the Mezzo-soprano Vocal Set (MVS), for vocal technique assessment. Our experimental results indicate that transfer learning increases the overall accuracy (OAcc) of all models by an average of 8.3%, with the highest accuracy at 94.2%.

Robust self-testing for nonlocal games with robust game algebras,Yuming Zhao,"We give an operator-algebraic formulation of robust self-testing in terms of states on C*-algebras. We show that a quantum correlation p is a robust self-test only if among all (abstract) states, there is a unique one achieving p. We show that the ""if"" direction of this statement also holds, provided that p is optimal/perfect for a nonlocal game that has a robust game algebra. This last condition applies to many nonlocal games of interest, including all XOR games, synchronous games, and boolean constrained system (BCS) games.   For those nonlocal games with robust game algebras, we prove that self-testing is equivalent to the uniqueness of finite-dimensional tracial states on the associated game algebra, and robust self-testing is equivalent to the uniqueness of amenable tracial states. Applying this tracial-state characterization of self-testing to parallel repetition, we show that a synchronous game is a self-test for perfect quantum strategies if and only if its parallel repeated version is a self-test for perfect quantum strategies.   As a proof approach, we give the first quantitative Gower-Hatami theorem that is applicable to C*-algebras. Here ""quantitative"" means there is a constructive bound on the distance between the approximate representations and exact representations. We also demonstrate how this quantitative Gowers-Hatami theorem can be used to calculate the explicit robustness function of a self-test.",2024-11-05T16:55:39Z,2024-11-05T16:55:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03259v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03259v1,"quant-ph, math.OA"
Guided Learning: Lubricating End-to-End Modeling for Multi-stage   Decision-making,"Jian Guo, Saizhuo Wang, Yiyan Qi","Multi-stage decision-making is crucial in various real-world artificial intelligence applications, including recommendation systems, autonomous driving, and quantitative investment systems. In quantitative investment, for example, the process typically involves several sequential stages such as factor mining, alpha prediction, portfolio optimization, and sometimes order execution. While state-of-the-art end-to-end modeling aims to unify these stages into a single global framework, it faces significant challenges: (1) training such a unified neural network consisting of multiple stages between initial inputs and final outputs often leads to suboptimal solutions, or even collapse, and (2) many decision-making scenarios are not easily reducible to standard prediction problems. To overcome these challenges, we propose Guided Learning, a novel methodological framework designed to enhance end-to-end learning in multi-stage decision-making. We introduce the concept of a ``guide'', a function that induces the training of intermediate neural network layers towards some phased goals, directing gradients away from suboptimal collapse. For decision scenarios lacking explicit supervisory labels, we incorporate a utility function that quantifies the ``reward'' of the throughout decision. Additionally, we explore the connections between Guided Learning and classic machine learning paradigms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, multi-task, and reinforcement learning. Experiments on quantitative investment strategy building demonstrate that guided learning significantly outperforms both traditional stage-wise approaches and existing end-to-end methods.",2024-11-15T06:54:25Z,2024-11-15T06:54:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10496v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10496v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, q-fin.CP"
A new approach to strong convergence II. The classical ensembles,"Chi-Fang Chen, Jorge Garza-Vargas, Ramon van Handel","The first paper in this series introduced a new approach to strong convergence of random matrices that is based primarily on soft arguments. This method was applied to achieve a refined qualitative and quantitative understanding of strong convergence of random permutation matrices and of more general representations of the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce new ideas that make it possible to achieve stronger quantitative results and that facilitate the application of the method to new models.   When applied to the Gaussian GUE/GOE/GSE ensembles of dimension $N$, these methods achieve strong convergence for noncommutative polynomials with matrix coefficients of dimension $\exp(o(N))$. This provides a sharp form of a result of Pisier on strong convergence with coefficients in a subexponential operator space. Analogous results up to logarithmic factors are obtained for Haar-distributed random matrices in $\mathrm{U}(N)/\mathrm{O}(N)/\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We further illustrate the methods of this paper in the following applications.   1. We obtain improved rates for strong convergence of random permutations.   2. We obtain a quantitative form of strong convergence of the model introduced by Hayes for the solution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture.   3.

Quantitative convergence of trained quantum neural networks to a   Gaussian process,"Anderson Melchor Hernandez, Filippo Girardi, Davide Pastorello, Giacomo De Palma","We study quantum neural networks where the generated function is the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables across all qubits. In [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726], it is proven that the probability distributions of such generated functions converge in distribution to a Gaussian process in the limit of infinite width for both untrained networks with randomly initialized parameters and trained networks. In this paper, we provide a quantitative proof of this convergence in terms of the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. First, we establish an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by any untrained network with finite width and the Gaussian process with the same covariance. This proof utilizes Stein's method to estimate the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. Next, we analyze the training dynamics of the network via gradient flow, proving an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by the trained network and the corresponding Gaussian process. This proof is based on a quantitative upper bound on the maximum variation of a parameter during training. This bound implies that for sufficiently large widths, training occurs in the lazy regime, \emph{i.e.}, each parameter changes only by a small amount. While the convergence result of [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726] holds at a fixed training time, our upper bounds are uniform in time and hold even as $t \to \infty$.",2024-12-04T10:09:56Z,2024-12-04T10:09:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03182v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03182v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP, math.PR, 81P45, 49Q22, 60F05"
"Quantitative Comparison of the Total Focusing Method, Reverse Time   Migration, and Full Waveform Inversion for Ultrasonic Imaging","Tim Bürchner, Simon Schmid, Lukas Bergbreiter, Ernst Rank, Stefan Kollmannsberger, Christian U. Grosse","Phased array ultrasound is a widely used technique in non-destructive testing. Using piezoelectric elements as both sources and receivers provides a significant gain in information and enables more accurate defect detection. When all source-receiver combinations are used, the process is called full matrix capture. The total focusing method~(TFM), which exploits such datasets, relies on a delay and sum algorithm to sum up the signals on a pixel grid. However, TFM only uses the first arriving p-waves, making it challenging to size complex-shaped defects. By contrast, more advanced methods such as reverse time migration~(RTM) and full waveform inversion~(FWI) use full waveforms to reconstruct defects. Both methods compare measured signals with ultrasound simulations. While RTM identifies defects by convolving forward and backward wavefields once, FWI iteratively updates material models to reconstruct the actual distribution of material properties. This study compares TFM, RTM, and FWI for six specimens featuring circular defects or Y-shaped notches. The reconstructed results are first evaluated qualitatively using different thresholds and then quantitatively using metrics such as AUPRC, AUROC, and F1-score. The results show that FWI performs best in most cases, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",2024-12-10T09:40:00Z,2024-12-10T09:40:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07347v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07347v1,"cs.CE, cs.NA, math.NA"
Dynamical modelling of the frailty index indicates that health reaches a   tipping point near age 75,"Glen Pridham, Kenneth Rockwood, Andrew D. Rutenberg","The frailty index (FI) serves as a useful quantitative summary of age-related health. We quantitatively modelled FI trajectories with age. We fit directly to longitudinal transitions in health attributes from normal to deficit and vice-versa. We used data from two large longitudinal studies: the Health and Retirement Study and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The studies included 47592 individuals with 254357 total visits. Using damage (deficit emergence) and repair (deficit recovery) transitions we estimated changes to robustness and resilience, respectively. We find that both robustness and resilience decrease continuously with both increasing age and FI. Remarkably, these declines caused a tipping point in health near age 75, when damage and repair rates are equal. Beyond this tipping point, the ongoing loss of both robustness and resilience leads to a sharp increase in the FI and a commensurate increase in risk of mortality. This tipping point was observed in both sexes, noting that males showed higher initial robustness and resilience, and commensurately steeper decline, consistent with the sex-frailty paradox. We infer that robustness and resilience mitigate environmental stressors only up to an age of 75, beyond which health deficits will increasingly accumulate leading to death.",2024-12-02T18:38:28Z,2024-12-02T18:38:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07795v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07795v1,"q-bio.QM, stat.AP"
A Physics-based Generative Model to Synthesize Training Datasets for   MRI-based Fat Quantification,"Juan P. Meneses, Yasmeen George, Christoph Hagemeyer, Zhaolin Chen, Sergio Uribe","Deep learning-based techniques have potential to optimize scan and post-processing times required for MRI-based fat quantification, but they are constrained by the lack of large training datasets. Generative models are a promising tool to perform data augmentation by synthesizing realistic datasets. However no previous methods have been specifically designed to generate datasets for quantitative MRI (q-MRI) tasks, where reference quantitative maps and large variability in scanning protocols are usually required. We propose a Physics-Informed Latent Diffusion Model (PI-LDM) to synthesize quantitative parameter maps jointly with customizable MR images by incorporating the signal generation model. We assessed the quality of PI-LDM's synthesized data using metrics such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), obtaining comparable scores to state-of-the-art generative methods (FID: 0.0459). We also trained a U-Net for the MRI-based fat quantification task incorporating synthetic datasets. When we used a few real (10 subjects, $~200$ slices) and numerous synthetic samples ($>3000$), fat fraction at specific liver ROIs showed a low bias on data obtained using the same protocol than training data ($0.10\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_1$, $0.12\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_2$) and on data acquired with an alternative protocol ($0.14\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_1$, $0.62\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_2$).

The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory I: pointwise   domination and weighted estimate,"Xi Cen, Zichen Song","How to establish some specific quantitative weighted estimates for the generalized commutator of multilinear fractional singular integral operator $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}$ is the focus of this paper, which is defined by $$\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}(\vec{f})(x):= \mathcal{T}_{\eta}\left((b_1(x) - b_1)^{\beta_1}f_1,\ldots,(b_m(x) - b_m)^{\beta_m}f_m\right)(x),$$ where $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}$ is a multilinear fractional singular integral operator, ${\bf b}:=({b_1}, \cdots ,{b_m})$ is a set of symbol functions, and $({\beta_1}, \cdots ,{\beta_m}) \in {\mathbb{N}_0^m}$.   Pointwise dominating the aforementioned commutator leads us to consider a class of higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator ${\mathcal A}_{\eta ,\mathcal{S},\tau}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$ to achieve this long-cherished wish. Therefore, it suffices to construct its quantitative weighted estimates, which firstly include the characterization of several types of multilinear weighted conditions $A_{\vec p,q}^*$, $W_{\vec p,q}^\infty$, and $H_{\vec p,q}^\infty$. Within the scope of this work, Bloom type estimate for first order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator is established herein. Moreover, we derive two distinct Bloom type estimates for higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator by using ""maximal weight method"" and ""iterated weight method"" respectively, which not only refines some of Lerner's methods but greatly enhances the generality of our conclusions.

The MACE-MP-0 foundation model shows remarkable performance for all observables derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but minor quantitative discrepancies remain compared to the AIMD reference data. However, we show that minimal fine-tuning -- fitting to as little as 1 ps of AIMD data -- leads to full quantitative agreement between the radial distribution functions of MACE force field and AIMD simulations. In addition, we show that traditional long-term AIMD simulations fail to capture the correct qualitative trends in diffusion coefficients and activation energies for these solid acids due to the limited accessible time scale. In contrast, accurate and convergent diffusion coefficients can be reliably obtained through multi-nanosecond long MD simulations using machine-learned force fields.

Drawing inspiration from physics, the framework provides both a theoretical and pragmatic perspective, offering a pictorial and quantitative representation of how on-demand platforms create value. It seeks to demystify their nuanced operations by providing practical, tangible, and highly applicable metrics, platform design templates, and real-time optimization tools for strategic what-if scenario planning. Its model demonstrates strong predictive power and is deeply rooted in raw data. The framework offers a deterministic insight into the workings of diverse platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and food delivery services. Furthermore, it generalizes to model all on-demand service platforms with cyclical operations. It works synergistically with machine learning, game theory, and agent-based models by providing a solid quantitative core rooted in raw data, based on physical truths, and is capable of delivering tangible predictions for real-time operational adjustments. The framework's mathematical model was rigorously validated using highly detailed historical data retrieved with near 100% certainty. Applying data-driven induction, distinct qualities were identified in big data sets via an iterative process. Through analogical thinking, a clear and highly intuitive mapping between the elements, operational principles, and dynamic behaviors of a well-known physical system was established to create a physics-inspired lens for Uber.

We first demonstrate rapid certification of the hyperentanglement dimensionality with a cumulative acquisition time of only 17 minutes. In particular, we verify transverse spatial entanglement through a violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with a minimum conditional uncertainty product of $(0.11\pm0.05)\hbar$ and certify the entanglement dimensionality to be at least 148. Next, by performing spatially-resolved polarization state tomography of the entire field, we demonstrate the generation of an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303\pm0.0004$. Together, the results reveal a total dimensionality of at least 251, which is the highest dimensionality reported for hyperentanglement. These measurements quantitatively resolve the influence of the spatial correlations of the down-converted photons and the angular spectrum of the pump beam on the polarization entanglement. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.",2025-02-05T20:08:52Z,2025-02-05T20:08:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03586v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03586v1,"quant-ph, physics.optics"

DNA denaturation as a new kind of phase transition,Mark Ya. Azbel',Unbinding of a double-stranded DNA reduces to an unscreened long range interaction and maps on various problems. Heterogeneity renormalizes interaction. Renormalization is temperature dependent. At an unbinding transition it approaches critical dimensionality. This implies giant non-universal critical indexes and invalidity of the Gibbs distribution sufficiently close to the critical temperature Tc. Fluctuations are macroscopically large below Tc. There are no fluctuations above it.,2002-12-09T09:25:38Z,2002-12-09T09:25:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0212175v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0212175v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph, q-bio"

On Kac's Chaos And Related Problems,"Maxime Hauray, Stéphane Mischler","This paper is devoted to establish quantitative and qualitative estimates related to the notion of chaos as firstly formulated by M. Kac in his study of mean-field limit for systems of $N$ undistinguishable particles. First, we quantitatively liken three usual measures of Kac's chaos, some involving the all $N$ variables, other involving a finite fixed number of variables. Next, we define the notion of entropy chaos and Fisher information chaos in a similar way as defined by Carlen et al (KRM 2010). We show that Fisher information chaos is stronger than entropy chaos, which in turn is stronger than Kac's chaos. More importantly, with the help of the HWI inequality of Otto-Villani, we establish a quantitative estimate between these quantities, which in particular asserts that Kac's chaos plus Fisher information bound implies entropy chaos. We then extend the above quantitative and qualitative results about chaos in the framework of probability measures with support on the Kac's spheres. Additionally to the above mentioned tool, we use and prove an optimal rate local CLT in $L^\infty$ norm for distributions with finite 6-th moment and finite $L^p$ norm, for some $p>1$. Last, we investigate how our techniques can be used without assuming chaos, in the context of probability measures mixtures introduced by De Finetti, Hewitt and Savage. In particular, we define the (level 3) Fisher information for mixtures and prove that it is l.s.c. and affine, as that was done previously for the level 3 Boltzmann's entropy.",2012-05-21T08:30:25Z,2014-03-31T08:44:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4518v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.4518v5,"math.AP, 26D15, 94A17, 60F05, 82C40, 43A15, 52A40"

Assessing the Health of Richibucto Estuary with the Latent Health Factor   Index,"Margaret Wu, Grace S. Chiu, Lin Lu","The ability to quantitatively assess the health of an ecosystem is often of great interest to those tasked with monitoring and conserving ecosystems. For decades, research in this area has relied upon multimetric indices of various forms. Although indices may be numbers, many are constructed based on procedures that are highly qualitative in nature, thus limiting the quantitative rigour of the practical interpretations made from these indices. The statistical modelling approach to construct the latent health factor index (LHFI) was recently developed to express ecological data, collected to construct conventional multimetric health indices, in a rigorous quantitative model that integrates qualitative features of ecosystem health and preconceived ecological relationships among such features. This hierarchical modelling approach allows (a) statistical inference of health for observed sites and (b) prediction of health for unobserved sites, all accompanied by formal uncertainty statements. Thus far, the LHFI approach has been demonstrated and validated on freshwater ecosystems. The goal of this paper is to adapt this approach to modelling estuarine ecosystem health, particularly that of the previously unassessed system in Richibucto in New Brunswick, Canada. Field data correspond to biotic health metrics that constitute the AZTI marine biotic index (AMBI) and abiotic predictors preconceived to influence biota. We also briefly discuss related LHFI research involving additional metrics that form the infaunal trophic index (ITI). Our paper is the first to construct a scientifically sensible model to rigorously identify the collective explanatory capacity of salinity, distance downstream, channel depth, and silt-clay content --- all regarded a priori as qualitatively important abiotic drivers --- towards site health in the Richibucto ecosystem.",2012-08-27T07:21:56Z,2013-06-24T07:29:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5311v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5311v4,"stat.AP, q-bio.QM"

Dynamic vortical flow profile quantitatively characterizes mitral   valvular-left ventricular hemodynamic coupling: In vivo analysis by dynamic   3D enstrophy mapping from 4D Flow MRI,"Mohammed S. M. Elbaz, Trung Bao Le, Pankaj Garg, Arno A. W. Roest, Boudewijn P. F. Lelieveldt, Sven Plein, Jos J. M. Westenberg, Fotis Sotiropoulos, Rob J. van der Geest","Vortical blood flow in the human left ventricular (LV) inflow initiates from the mitral valve (MV) and evolves within the LV during diastolic E-filling. Hence, vortical flow links MV and LV hemodynamics. This study sought to elucidate and quantitatively characterize the in vivo 3D dynamics of LV vortical flow over E-filling and relation to MV-LV hemodynamic coupling using 4D Flow MRI flow field. 34 healthy volunteers and 5 example patients underwent 4D Flow MRI. Vortical blood flow evolution was mapped in the LV over E-wave using enstrophy density. A new dimensionless profile PMV-LV was derived as a function of both MV vortex formation time (VFT) and LV volumetric enstrophy density. Results reveal that 3D vortical flow evolution in the healthy LV follows a bi-phasic behavior with a vortical growth phase followed by a vortical decay phase. In healthy LVs studied, the PMV-LV profile showed that the vortical growth and decay phases are characterized by a vortical growth time T_growth= 1.23+/-0.25, growth rate {\alpha}=0.80+/-0.17, decay time T_decay= 0.96+/-0.39 and decay rate \b{eta}=-1.02+/-0.49. Distinctly altered parameters were found in the pilot patients studied. The derived PMV-LV profile quantitatively characterizes MV-LV hemodynamic coupling by vortical flow dynamics.

Quantitative test of the barrier nucleosome model for statistical   positioning of nucleosomes up- and downstream of transcription start sites,"Wolfram Mobius, Ulrich Gerland","The positions of nucleosomes in eukaryotic genomes determine which parts of the DNA sequence are readily accessible for regulatory proteins and which are not. Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern around transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density. While the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the positioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et al. argued that the pattern observed in S. cerevisiae is qualitatively consistent with a `barrier nucleosome model', in which the oscillatory pattern is created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On the other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect the observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively analyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs. Our analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which quantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes and their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the two sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by the same physical model, with the same parameters, but different boundary conditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome downstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned while the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a nucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be locally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical distribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ~1000 bp to each side.",2010-09-01T12:15:39Z,2010-09-01T12:15:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0169v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.0169v1,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.GN"

Magnetization Transfer-Mediated MR Fingerprinting,"Daniel J. West, Gastao Cruz, Rui P. A. G. Teixeira, Torben Schneider, Jacques-Donald Tournier, Joseph V. Hajnal, Claudia Prieto, Shaihan J. Malik","Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) and inhomogeneous MT (ihMT) contrasts are used in MRI to provide information about macromolecular tissue content. In particular, MT is sensitive to macromolecules and ihMT appears to be specific to myelinated tissue. This study proposes a technique to characterize MT and ihMT properties from a single acquisition, producing both semiquantitative contrast ratios, and quantitative parameter maps.   Theory and Methods: Building upon previous work that uses multiband radiofrequency (RF) pulses to efficiently generate ihMT contrast, we propose a cyclic-steady-state approach that cycles between multiband and single-band pulses to boost the achieved contrast. Resultant time-variable signals are reminiscent of a magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) acquisition, except that the signal fluctuations are entirely mediated by magnetization transfer effects. A dictionary-based low-rank inversion method is used to reconstruct the resulting images and to produce both semiquantitative MT ratio (MTR) and ihMT ratio (ihMTR) maps, as well as quantitative parameter estimates corresponding to an ihMT tissue model.   Results: Phantom and in vivo brain data acquired at 1.5T demonstrate the expected contrast trends, with ihMTR maps showing contrast more specific to white matter (WM), as has been reported by others. Quantitative estimation of semisolid fraction and dipolar T1 was also possible and yielded measurements consistent with literature values in the brain.   Conclusions: By cycling between multiband and single-band pulses, an entirely magnetization transfer mediated 'fingerprinting' method was demonstrated. This proof-of-concept approach can be used to generate semiquantitative maps and quantitatively estimate some macromolecular specific tissue parameters.",2021-04-06T10:20:34Z,2021-08-23T09:10:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02406v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02406v2,"physics.med-ph, eess.IV"

Fracture Mechanics-Based Quantitative Matching of Forensic Evidence   Fragments,"Geoffrey Z. Thompson, Bishoy Dawood, Tianyu Yu, Barbara K. Lograsso, John D. Vanderkolk, Ranjan Maitra, William Q. Meeker, Ashraf F. Bastawros","Fractured metal fragments with rough and irregular surfaces are often found at crime scenes. Current forensic practice visually inspects the complex jagged trajectory of fractured surfaces to recognize a ``match'' using comparative microscopy and physical pattern analysis. We developed a novel computational framework, utilizing the basic concepts of fracture mechanics and statistical analysis to provide quantitative match analysis for match probability and error rates. The framework employs the statistics of fracture surfaces to become non-self-affine with unique roughness characteristics at relevant microscopic length scale, dictated by the intrinsic material resistance to fracture and its microstructure. At such a scale, which was found to be greater than two grain-size or micro-feature-size, we establish that the material intrinsic properties, microstructure, and exposure history to external forces on an evidence fragment have the premise of uniqueness, which quantitatively describes the microscopic features on the fracture surface for forensic comparisons. The methodology utilizes 3D spectral analysis of overlapping topological images of the fracture surface and classifies specimens with very high accuracy using statistical learning. Cross correlations of image-pairs in two frequency ranges are used to develop matrix variate statistical models for the distributions among matching and non-matching pairs of images, and provides a decision rule for identifying matches and determining error rates.

Quantitative Marcinkiewicz's theorem and central limit theorems:   applications to spin systems and point processes,"Tien-Cuong Dinh, Subhroshekhar Ghosh, Hoang-Son Tran, Manh-Hung Tran","The classical Marcinkiewicz theorem states that if an entire characteristic function $\Psi$ of a non-degenerate real-valued random variable $X$ is of the form $\exp(P(u))$ for some polynomial $P$, then $X$ has to be a Gaussian. In this work, we obtain a broad, quantitative extension of this framework in several directions, establish central limit theorems (CLTs) with explicit rates of convergence, and demonstrate Gaussian fluctuations in continuous spin systems and general classes of point processes. In particular, we obtain quantitative decay estimates on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between $X$ and a Gaussian under the condition that $\Psi$ does not vanish only on a bounded disk. This leads to quantitative CLTs applicable to very general and possibly strongly dependent random systems. In spite of the general applicability, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor. We implement this programme for two important classes of models in probability and statistical physics. First, we extend to the setting of continuous spins a popular paradigm for obtaining CLTs for discrete spin systems that is based on the theory of Lee-Yang zeros, focussing in particular on the XY model, Heisenberg ferromagnets and generalised Ising models. Secondly, we establish Gaussian fluctuations for linear statistics of so-called $\alpha$-determinantal processes for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ (including the usual determinantal, Poisson and permanental processes) under very general conditions, including in particular higher dimensional settings where structural alternatives such as random matrix techniques are not available. Our applications demonstrate the significance of having to control the characteristic function only on a (small) disk, and lead to CLTs which, to the best of our knowledge, are not known in generality.",2021-07-18T15:02:09Z,2021-07-25T04:25:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08469v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08469v2,"math.PR, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, math.CA, math.MP"

Quantitative Matching of Forensic Evidence Fragments Utilizing 3D   Microscopy Analysis of Fracture Surface Replicas,"Bishoy Dawood, Carlos Llosa-Vite, Geoffrey Z. Thompson, Barbara K. Lograsso, Lauren K. Claytor, John Vanderkolk, William Meeker, Ranjan Maitra, Ashraf Bastawros","Fractured surfaces carry unique details that can provide an accurate quantitative comparison to support comparative forensic analysis of those fractured surfaces. In this study, a statistical analysis comparison protocol was applied to a set of 3D topological images of fractured surface pairs and their replicas to provide confidence in the quantitative statistical comparison between fractured items and their replicas. A set of 10 fractured stainless steel samples was fractured from the same metal rod under controlled conditions and were cast using a standard forensic casting technique. Six 3D topological maps with 50% overlap were acquired for each fractured pair. Spectral analysis was utilized to identify the correlation between topological surface features at different length scales of the surface topology. We selected two frequency bands over the critical wavelength (which is greater than two-grain diameters) for statistical comparison. Our statistical model utilized a matrix-variate-$t$ distribution that accounts for the image-overlap to model the match and non-match population densities. A decision rule was developed to identify the probability of matched and unmatched pairs of surfaces. The proposed methodology correctly classified the fractured steel surfaces and their replicas with a posterior probability of match exceeding 99.96%.

Learning Outcomes supporting the integration of Ethical Reasoning into   quantitative courses: Three tasks for use in three general contexts,Rochelle E. Tractenberg,"This 2024 chapter gives a brief overview of cognitive and educational sciences' perspectives on learning outcomes (LOs) to facilitate the integration of LOs specific to ethical reasoning into any mathematics or quantitative course. The target is undergraduate (adult) learners but these LOs can be adapted for earlier and later stages of learning. Core contents of Ethical Reasoning are: 1. its six constituent knowledge, skills, and abilities; 2. a stakeholder analysis; and 3. ethical practice standards or guidelines. These are briefly summarized. Five LOs are articulated at each of three levels of cognitive complexity (low/med/high), and a set of assignment features that can be adapted repeatedly over a term are given supporting these LOs. These features can support authentic development of the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the target of ethical reasoning instruction in math and quantitative courses at the tertiary level. Three contexts by which these can be integrated are Assumption (what if the assumption fails?), Approximation (what if the approximation does not hold?), and Application (is the application appropriate? what if it is not?). One or more of the three core contents of Ethical Reasoning can be added to any problem already utilized in a course (or new ones) by asking learners to apply the core to the context. Engagement with ethical reasoning can prepare students to assume their responsibilities to promote and perpetuate the integrity of their profession across their careers using mathematics, statistics, data science, and other quantitative methods and technologies.",2023-05-29T18:46:46Z,2024-11-13T19:39:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18561v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18561v3,"math.HO, 00A35, 97C70, 97U30, A.0; K.0; K.3; K.4"

Quantitative MR Image Reconstruction using Parameter-Specific Dictionary   Learning with Adaptive Dictionary-Size and Sparsity-Level Choice,"Andreas Kofler, Kirsten Miriam Kerkering, Laura Göschel, Ariane Fillmer, Cristoph Kolbitsch","Objective: We propose a method for the reconstruction of parameter-maps in Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (QMRI).   Methods: Because different quantitative parameter-maps differ from each other in terms of local features, we propose a method where the employed dictionary learning (DL) and sparse coding (SC) algorithms automatically estimate the optimal dictionary-size and sparsity level separately for each parameter-map. We evaluated the method on a $T_1$-mapping QMRI problem in the brain using the BrainWeb data as well as in-vivo brain images acquired on an ultra-high field 7T scanner. We compared it to a model-based acceleration for parameter mapping (MAP) approach, other sparsity-based methods using total variation (TV), Wavelets (Wl) and Shearlets (Sh), and to a method which uses DL and SC to reconstruct qualitative images, followed by a non-linear (DL+Fit).   Results: Our algorithm surpasses MAP, TV, Wl and Sh in terms of RMSE and PSNR. It yields better or comparable results to DL+Fit by additionally significantly accelerating the reconstruction by a factor of approximately seven.   Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms the reported methods of comparison and yields accurate $T_1$-maps. Although presented for $T_1$-mapping in the brain, our method's structure is general and thus most probably also applicable for the the reconstruction of other quantitative parameters in other organs.   Significance: From a clinical perspective, the obtained $T_1$-maps could be utilized to differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease.

"Teaching at the Intersection of Social Justice, Ethics, and the ASA   Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice",Rochelle E Tractenberg,"Case studies are typically used to teach 'ethics', but when the content of a course is focused on formulae and proofs, a case analysis and the knowledge, skills, and abilities they require can be distracting. Moreover, case analyses are typically focused narrowly on research issues: obtaining consent, dealing with research team members, and/or research policy violations. Not all students in quantitative courses plan to become researchers, and ethical practice of mathematics, statistics, data science, and computing is an essential topic regardless of the learner's career plans. While it is incorrect to treat 'social justice' as a proxy for 'ethical practice', the topic of 'social justice' may be more interesting to both students and instructors. This paper offers concrete recommendations for integrating social justice content into quantitative courses in ways that limit the burden of new knowledge, skills, and abilities but also support reproducible and actionable assessments. Five tools can be utilized to integrate social justice into a course in a way that also meets calls to integrate 'ethics'; minimizes the burden on instructors to create and grade new materials and assignments; minimizes the burden on learners to develop the skill set to complete a case analysis; and maximizes the likelihood that the ethics content will be embedded in the learners' cognitive representation of the knowledge being taught in the quantitative course. These tools are: a. Curriculum Development Guidelines b. 7-task Statistics and Data Science Pipeline c. ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice d.

Iterative Clustering Material Decomposition Aided by Empirical Spectral   Correction for High-Resolution Photon-Counting Detectors in Micro-CT,"Juan C. R. Luna, Mini Das","Photon counting detectors (PCDs) offer promising advancements in computed tomography (CT) imaging by enabling the quantification and 3D imaging of contrast agents and tissue types through multi-energy projections. However, the accuracy of these decomposition methods hinges on precise composite spectral attenuation values that one must reconstruct from spectral micro CT. Factors such as surface defects, local temperature, signal amplification, and impurity levels can cause variations in detector efficiency between pixels, leading to significant quantitative errors. In addition, some inaccuracies such as the charge-sharing effects in PCDs are amplified with a high Z sensor material and also with a smaller detector pixels that are preferred for micro CT. In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach that combines practical instrumentation and measurement strategies leading to the quantitation of multiple materials within an object in a spectral micro CT with a photon counting detector. Our Iterative Clustering Material Decomposition (ICMD) includes an empirical method for detector spectral response corrections, cluster analysis and multi-step iterative material decomposition. Utilizing a CdTe-1mm Medipix detector with a 55$\mu$m pitch, we demonstrate the quantitatively accurate decomposition of several materials in a phantom study, where the sample includes mixtures of material, soft material and K-edge materials. We also show an example of biological sample imaging and separating three distinct types of tissue in mouse: muscle, fat and bone. Our experimental results show that the combination of spectral correction and high-dimensional data clustering enhances decomposition accuracy and reduces noise in micro CT.

High-resolution myelin-water fraction and quantitative relaxation   mapping using 3D ViSTa-MR fingerprinting,"Congyu Liao, Xiaozhi Cao, Siddharth Srinivasan Iyer, Sophie Schauman, Zihan Zhou, Xiaoqian Yan, Quan Chen, Zhitao Li, Nan Wang, Ting Gong, Zhe Wu, Hongjian He, Jianhui Zhong, Yang Yang, Adam Kerr, Kalanit Grill-Spector, Kawin Setsompop","Purpose: This study aims to develop a high-resolution whole-brain multi-parametric quantitative MRI approach for simultaneous mapping of myelin-water fraction (MWF), T1, T2, and proton-density (PD), all within a clinically feasible scan time.   Methods: We developed 3D ViSTa-MRF, which combined Visualization of Short Transverse relaxation time component (ViSTa) technique with MR Fingerprinting (MRF), to achieve high-fidelity whole-brain MWF and T1/T2/PD mapping on a clinical 3T scanner. To achieve fast acquisition and memory-efficient reconstruction, the ViSTa-MRF sequence leverages an optimized 3D tiny-golden-angle-shuffling spiral-projection acquisition and joint spatial-temporal subspace reconstruction with optimized preconditioning algorithm. With the proposed ViSTa-MRF approach, high-fidelity direct MWF mapping was achieved without a need for multi-compartment fitting that could introduce bias and/or noise from additional assumptions or priors.   Results: The in-vivo results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed acquisition and reconstruction framework to provide fast multi-parametric mapping with high SNR and good quality. The in-vivo results of 1mm- and 0.66mm-iso datasets indicate that the MWF values measured by the proposed method are consistent with standard ViSTa results that are 30x slower with lower SNR. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method to enable 5-minute whole-brain 1mm-iso assessment of MWF and T1/T2/PD mappings for infant brain development and for post-mortem brain samples.   Conclusions: In this work, we have developed a 3D ViSTa-MRF technique that enables the acquisition of whole-brain MWF, quantitative T1, T2, and PD maps at 1mm and 0.66mm isotropic resolution in 5 and 15 minutes, respectively.

Rapid hyperspectral photothermal mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging from   sparse data for gynecologic cancer tissue subtyping,"Reza Reihanisaransari, Chalapathi Charan Gajjela, Xinyu Wu, Ragib Ishrak, Sara Corvigno, Yanping Zhong, Jinsong Liu, Anil K. Sood, David Mayerich, Sebastian Berisha, Rohith Reddy","Ovarian cancer detection has traditionally relied on a multi-step process that includes biopsy, tissue staining, and morphological analysis by experienced pathologists. While widely practiced, this conventional approach suffers from several drawbacks: it is qualitative, time-intensive, and heavily dependent on the quality of staining. Mid-infrared (MIR) hyperspectral photothermal imaging is a label-free, biochemically quantitative technology that, when combined with machine learning algorithms, can eliminate the need for staining and provide quantitative results comparable to traditional histology. However, this technology is slow. This work presents a novel approach to MIR photothermal imaging that enhances its speed by an order of magnitude. Our method significantly accelerates data collection by capturing a combination of high-resolution and interleaved, lower-resolution infrared band images and applying computational techniques for data interpolation. We effectively minimize data collection requirements by leveraging sparse data acquisition and employing curvelet-based reconstruction algorithms. This method enables the reconstruction of high-quality, high-resolution images from undersampled datasets and achieving a 10X improvement in data acquisition time. We assessed the performance of our sparse imaging methodology using a variety of quantitative metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and tissue subtype classification accuracies, employing both random forest and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, accompanied by ROC curves. Our statistically robust analysis, based on data from 100 ovarian cancer patient samples and over 65 million data points, demonstrates the method's capability to produce superior image quality and accurately distinguish between different gynecological tissue types with segmentation accuracy exceeding 95%.",2024-02-28T00:57:35Z,2024-02-28T00:57:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17960v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17960v1,"cs.CV, q-bio.BM, q-bio.QM, q-bio.TO"
"Time-efficient, high-resolution 3T whole-brain relaxometry using   Cartesian 3D MR-STAT with CSF suppression","Hongyan Liu, Edwin Versteeg, Miha Fuderer, Oscar van der Heide, Martin B. Schilder, Cornelis A. T. van den Berg, Alessandro Sbrizzi","Purpose: Current 3D Magnetic Resonance Spin TomogrAphy in Time-domain (MR-STAT) protocols use transient-state, gradient-spoiled gradient-echo sequences that are prone to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsation artifacts when applied to the brain. This study aims at developing a 3D MR-STAT protocol for whole-brain relaxometry that overcomes the challenges posed by CSF-induced ghosting artifacts. Method: We optimized the flip-angle train within the Cartesian 3D MR-STAT framework to achieve two objectives: (1) minimization of the noise level in the reconstructed quantitative maps, and (2) reduction of the CSF-to-white-matter signal ratio to suppress CSF signal and the associated pulsation artifacts. The optimized new sequence was tested on a gel/water-phantom to evaluate the accuracy of the quantitative maps, and on healthy volunteers to explore the effectiveness of the CSF artifact suppression and robustness of the new protocol. Results: A new optimized sequence with both high parameter encoding capability and low CSF intensity was proposed and initially validated in the gel/water-phantom experiment. From in-vivo experiments with five volunteers, the proposed CSF-suppressed sequence shows no CSF ghosting artifacts and overall greatly improved image quality for all quantitative maps compared to the baseline sequence. Statistical analysis indicated low inter-subject and inter-scan variability for quantitative parameters in gray matter and white matter (1.6%-2.4% for T1 and 2.0%-4.6% for T2), demonstrating the robustness of the new sequence.

Exploiting network optimization stability for enhanced PET image   denoising using deep image prior,"Fumio Hashimoto, Kibo Ote, Yuya Onishi, Hideaki Tashima, Go Akamatsu, Yuma Iwao, Miwako Takahashi, Taiga Yamaya","PET is affected by statistical noise due to constraints on tracer dose and scan duration, impacting both diagnostic performance and quantitative accuracy. While deep learning (DL)-based PET denoising methods have been used to improve image quality, they may introduce over-smoothing, compromising quantitative accuracy. We propose a method for making a DL solution more reliable and apply it to the conditional deep image prior (DIP). We introduce the idea of stability information in the optimization process of conditional DIP, enabling the identification of unstable regions within the network's optimization trajectory. Our method incorporates a stability map, which is derived from multiple intermediate outputs of moderate network at different optimization steps. The final denoised image is then obtained by computing linear combination of the DIP output and the original reconstructed image, weighted by the stability map. Our method effectively reduces noise while preserving small structure details in brain FDG images. Results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing methods in peak-to-valley ratio and noise suppression across various low-dose levels. Region-of-interest analysis confirmed that the proposed method maintains quantitative accuracy without introducing under- or over-estimation. We applied our method to full-dose PET data to assess its impact on image quality. The results revealed that the proposed method significantly reduced background noise while preserving the peak-to-valley ratio at a level comparable to that of unfiltered full-dose PET images. The proposed method introduces a robust approach to DL-based PET denoising, enhancing its reliability and preserving quantitative accuracy. This strategy has the potential to advance performance in high-sensitivity PET scanners, demonstrating that DL can extend PET imaging capabilities beyond low-dose applications.",2025-02-16T20:27:56Z,2025-02-16T20:27:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11259v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11259v1,"physics.med-ph, cs.CV"

Mechanical Alignment of Suprathermal Paramagnetic Cosmic-Dust Granules:   the Cross-Section Mechanism,Michael Efroimsky,"We develop a comprehensive quantitative description of the cross-section mechanism discovered several years ago by Lazarian. This is one of the processes that determine grain orientation in clouds of suprathermal cosmic dust. The cross-section mechanism manifests itself when an ensemble of suprathermal paramagnetic granules is placed in a magnetic field and is subject to ultrasonic gas bombardment. The mechanism yields dust alignment whose efficiency depends upon two factors: the geometric shape of the granules, and the angle Phi between the magnetic line and the gas flow. We calculate the quantitative measure of this alignment, and study its dependence upon the said factors.

We attempt to evaluate two different approaches to anaphoric processing in discourse by comparing the accuracy and coverage of two published algorithms for finding the co-specifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and dialogues. We present the quantitative results of hand-simulating these algorithms, but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performing such evaluations in general. We illustrate the general difficulties encountered with quantitative evaluation. These are problems with: (a) allowing for underlying assumptions, (b) determining how to handle underspecifications, and (c) evaluating the contribution of false positives and error chaining.",1994-10-10T21:58:11Z,1994-10-11T15:31:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9410006v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cmp-lg/9410006v2,"cmp-lg, cs.CL"
Solvent-induced organization: A physical model of folding myoglobin,David J. E. Callaway,"The essential features of the in vitro refolding of myoglobin are expressed in a solvable physical model. Alpha helices are taken as the fundamental collective coordinates of the system, while the refolding is assumed to be mainly driven by solvent-induced hydrophobic forces. A quantitative model of these forces is developed and compared with experimental and theoretical results. The model is then tested by being employed in a simulation scheme designed to mimic solvent effects. Realistic dynamic trajectories of myoglobin are shown as it folds from an extended conformation to a close approximation of the native state. Various suggestive features of the process are discussed. The tenets of the model are further tested by folding the single-chain plant protein leghemoglobin.",1994-06-16T21:36:25Z,1994-06-16T21:36:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9406071v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9406071v1,"cond-mat, chem-ph, hep-lat, q-bio"
Democratic Reinforcement: Learning via Self-Organization,"Dimitris Stassinopoulos, Per Bak","The problem of learning in the absence of external intelligence is discussed in the context of a simple model. The model consists of a set of randomly connected, or layered integrate-and fire neurons. Inputs to and outputs from the environment are connected randomly to subsets of neurons. The connections between firing neurons are strengthened or weakened according to whether the action is successful or not. The model departs from the traditional gradient-descent based approaches to learning by operating at a highly susceptible ``critical'' state, with low activity and sparse connections between firing neurons. Quantitative studies on the performance of our model in a simple association task show that by tuning our system close to this critical state we can obtain dramatic gains in performance.",1996-01-23T23:05:51Z,1996-01-23T23:05:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9601113v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9601113v1,"cond-mat, q-bio"
Dynamically-Stabilized Pores in Bilayer Membranes,"J. David Moroz, Philip Nelson","Zhelev and Needham have recently created large, quasi-stable pores in artificial lipid bilayer vesicles [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1147 (1993) 89]. Initially created by electroporation, the pores remain open for up to several seconds before quickly snapping shut. This result is surprising in light of the large line tension for holes in bilayer membranes and the rapid time scale for closure of large pores. We show how pores can be dynamically stabilized via a new feedback mechanism. We also explain quantitatively the observed sudden pore closure as a tangent bifurcation. Finally we show how Zhelev and Needham's experiment can be used to measure accurately the pore line tension, an important material parameter. For their SOPC/CHOL mixture we obtain a line tension of 2.6 10^{-6} erg/cm.",1996-10-08T22:31:31Z,1997-05-14T23:57:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9610072v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9610072v2,"cond-mat.soft, q-bio"
Viscosity Dependence of the Folding Rates of Proteins,"D. K. Klimov, D. Thirumalai","The viscosity dependence of the folding rates for four sequences (the native state of three sequences is a beta-sheet, while the fourth forms an alpha-helix) is calculated for off-lattice models of proteins. Assuming that the dynamics is given by the Langevin equation we show that the folding rates increase linearly at low viscosities \eta, decrease as 1/\eta at large \eta and have a maximum at intermediate values. The Kramers theory of barrier crossing provides a quantitative fit of the numerical results. By mapping the simulation results to real proteins we estimate that for optimized sequences the time scale for forming a four turn \alpha-helix topology is about 500 nanoseconds, whereas the time scale for forming a beta-sheet topology is about 10 microseconds.",1997-05-30T15:04:14Z,1997-05-30T15:04:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9705309v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9705309v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio"
Entropic Elasticity of Twist-Storing Polymers,"J. David Moroz, Philip Nelson","We investigate the statistical mechanics of a torsionally constrained polymer. The polymer is modeled as a fluctuating rod with bend stiffness A kT and twist stiffness C kT. In such a model, thermal bend fluctuations couple geometrically to an applied torque through the relation Lk = Tw + Wr. We explore this coupling and find agreement between the predictions of our model and recent experimental results on single lambda-DNA molecules. This analysis affords an experimental determination of the microscopic twist stiffness (averaged over a helix repeat). Quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is obtained using C=109 nm. The theory further predicts a thermal reduction of the effective twist rigidity induced by bend fluctuations. Finally, we find a small reflection of molecular chirality in the experimental data and interpret it in terms of a twist-stretch coupling of the DNA duplex.",1997-11-30T18:51:38Z,1998-06-03T21:53:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9712004v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9712004v2,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio"
Optimal Detection of Sequence Similarity by Local Alignment,"Terence Hwa, Michael Lassig","The statistical properties of local alignment algorithms with gaps are analyzed theoretically for uncorrelated and correlated DNA sequences. In the vicinity of the log-linear phase transition, the statistics of alignment with gaps is shown to be characteristically different from that of gapless alignment. The optimal scores obtained for uncorrelated sequences obey certain robust scaling laws. Deviation from these scaling laws signals sequence homology, and can be used to guide the empirical selection of scoring parameters for the optimal detection of sequence similarities. This can be accomplished in a computationally efficient way by using a novel approach focusing on the score landscape. Furthermore, by assuming a few gross features characterizing the statistics of underlying sequence-sequence correlations, quantitative criteria are obtained for the choice of optimal scoring parameters: Optimal similarity detection is most likely to occur in a region close to the log side of the log-linear phase transition.",1997-12-06T05:22:38Z,1998-02-12T09:32:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9712081v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9712081v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Cooperativity in Protein Folding: From Lattice Models with Side Chains   to Real Proteins,"D. K. Klimov, D. Thirumalai","We consider equilibrium folding transitions in lattice protein models with and without side chains. A dimensionless measure, $Omega_{c}$, is introduced to quantitatively assess the degree of cooperativity in lattice models and in real proteins. We show that larger values of $\Omega_{c}$ resembling those seen in proteins are obtained in lattice models with side chains (LMSC). The enhanced cooperativity in LMSC is due to the possibility of denser packing of side chains in the interior of the model protein. We also establish that $\Omega_{c}$ correlates extremely well with (\sigma = (T_{\theta} -T_{f} )/T_{\theta}), where (T_{\theta}) and (T_{f}) are collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. These theoretical ideas are used to analyze folding transitions in various real proteins. The values of $\Omega _{c}$ extracted from experiments show a correlation with $\sigma $. We conclude that the degree of cooperativity can be expressed in terms of the single parameter $\sigma $, which can be estimated from experimental data.",1998-04-22T16:53:00Z,1998-04-22T16:53:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9804243v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9804243v1,"cond-mat.soft, q-bio"
Attractor neural networks storing multiple space representations: a   model for hippocampal place fields,"Francesco P.

A network of this type has been suggested as a model for the origin of place cells in the hippocampus of rodents. The extremely diluted and fully connected limits are studied, and the storage capacity and the information capacity are found. The important parameters determining the performance of the network are the sparsity of the spatial representations and the degree of connectivity, as found already for the storage of individual memory patterns in the general theory of auto-associative networks. Such results suggest a quantitative parallel between theories of hippocampal function in different animal species, such as primates (episodic memory) and rodents (memory for space).",1998-07-07T13:38:55Z,1998-07-07T13:38:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9807101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9807101v1,"cond-mat.dis-nn, q-bio"
Stretching DNA: Role of electrostatic interaction,"Namkyung Lee, D. Thirumalai","The effect of electrostatic interactions on the stretching of DNA is investigated using a simple worm like chain model. In the limit of small force there are large conformational fluctuations which are treated using a self-consistent variational approach. For small values of the external force f, we find theoreticlly and by a simple blob picture that the extension scales as fr_D where r_D is the Debye screening length. In the limit of large force the electrostatic effects can be accounted for within the semiflexible chain model of DNA by assuming that only small excursions from rod-like conformations are possible. In this regime the extension approaches the contour length as f^{-1/2} where f is the magnitude of the external force. The theory is used to analyze experiments that have measured the extension of double-stranded DNA subject to tension at various salt concentrations. The theory reproduces nearly quantitatively the elastic response of DNA at small and large values of f and for all concentration of the monovalent counterions. The limitations of the theory are also pointed out.",1998-10-08T19:04:23Z,1998-10-08T19:04:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9810104v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9810104v1,"cond-mat.soft, q-bio"
Thermodynamics of Heat Shock Response,"Kristine Bourke Arnvig, Steen Pedersen, Kim Sneppen","Production of heat shock proteins are induced when a living cell is exposed to a rise in temperature. The heat shock response of protein DnaK synthesis in E.coli for temperature shifts from temperature T to T plus 7 degrees, respectively to T minus 7 degrees is measured as function of the initial temperature T. We observe a reversed heat shock at low T. The magnitude of the shock increases when one increase the distance to the temperature $T_0 \approx 23^o$, thereby mimicking the non monotous stability of proteins at low temperature. Further we found that the variation of the heat shock with T quantitatively follows the thermodynamic stability of proteins with temperature. This suggest that stability related to hot as well as cold unfolding of proteins is directly implemented in the biological control of protein folding. We demonstrate that such an implementation is possible in a minimalistic chemical network.",1999-12-22T10:16:12Z,1999-12-22T10:16:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9912402v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9912402v1,"cond-mat, q-bio"
Pathways in Two-State Protein Folding,"Audun Bakk, Johan S.

The rather short folding times of the two-state process indicate that folding is guided. We reconcile these two seemingly contradictory observations quantitatively in a schematic model of protein folding. We propose a new dynamical transition temperature which is lower than the thermodynamic one, in qualitative agreement with in vivo measurement of protein stability using E.coli. Finally we demonstrate that our framework is easily generalized to encompass cold unfolding, and make predictions that relate the sharpness of the cold and hot unfolding transitions.",1999-12-30T13:20:13Z,1999-12-30T13:20:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9912483v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9912483v1,"cond-mat, q-bio"

Below a crossover temperature, the bacteria are confined to regions that are shielded from UV radiation. A forced convection of the population is effected by rotating a UV radiation shield relative to the petri dish. The extinction speed at which the bacterial colony lags behind the shield is found to be qualitatively similar to the front velocity of the colony growing in the absence of the hostile environment as predicted by the model of Dahmen, Nelson and Shnerb.

Using surrogate data with the true market return as the dominant factor, we show that most of these correlations, measured by a variety of different indicators, can be accounted for. In particular, this one-factor model can explain the level and asymmetry of empirical exceedance correlations. However, more subtle effects require an extension of the one factor model, where the variance and skewness of the residuals also depend on the market return.",2000-06-02T12:03:25Z,2001-01-22T15:27:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0006034v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0006034v2,"cond-mat.dis-nn, q-fin.ST"

We furthermore study the denaturated-native transitions for a wide class of possible effective Hamiltonians based on this scheme, and find that the sharpness (tightness) of the transitions typically are close to their theoretical maximum and thus in quantitative accordance with the sharp folding transition observed for single domain proteins. Finally we demonstrate that realistic folding times are typical for the proposed class of Hamiltonians, and we discuss the implication of the predicted entropy barriers on the temperature dependence of the folding times.",2000-06-20T16:11:22Z,2000-06-20T16:11:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0006304v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0006304v1,"cond-mat, q-bio"
Microscopic Theory of Protein Folding Rates.II: Local Reaction   Coordinates and Chain Dynamics,"John J. Portman, Shoji Takada, Peter G. Wolynes","The motion involved in barrier crossing for protein folding are investigated in terms of the chain dynamics of the polymer backbone, completing the microscopic description of protein folding presented in the previous paper. Local reaction coordinates are identified as collective growth modes of the unstable fluctuations about the saddle-points in the free energy surface. The description of the chain dynamics incorporates internal friction (independent of the solvent viscosity) arising from the elementary isomerizations of the backbone dihedral angles. We find that the folding rate depends linearly on the solvent friction for high viscosity, but saturates at low viscosity because of internal friction. For $\lambda$-repressor, the calculated folding rate prefactor, along with the free energy barrier from the variational theory, gives a folding rate that agrees well with the experimentally determined rate under highly stabilizing conditions, but the theory predicts too large a folding rate at the transition midpoint. This discrepancy obtained using a fairly complete quantitative theory inspires a new set of questions about chain dynamics, specifically detailed motions in individual contact formation.",2000-08-30T19:25:35Z,2000-08-30T19:25:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0008455v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0008455v1,"cond-mat.soft, q-bio"
New approach to Monte Carlo calculation of buckling of supercoiled DNA   loops,Zhang Yang,"The short supercoiled circular DNA molecules are shown to be glassy systems and canonical Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of the systems tend to get stuck in local metastable energy basins. A novel Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to alleviate the problem of ``ergodicity breaking'' of the glassy systems, in which the Markov process is driven by an explicitly analytic weight factor with enhanced probability in both low- and high-energy regions. To characterize the degree of puckering of the supercoiled DNA loops, a new quantity of aplanarity is introduced as the shortest principal axis of configurational ellipsoid of DNA. With the suggested Monte Carlo method, the quantitative correlation between supercoiling degree and buckling of DNA is attained. With supercoiling stress increasing, the conformational transition from a circle to mono-, diplo- or triple interwound superhelical structure will take place in a successive but decreasingly abrupt mode.",2000-09-11T19:49:12Z,2000-09-11T19:49:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0009159v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0009159v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-ph, physics.bio-ph, physics.comp-ph, q-bio"

The method is based on the idea that light transmitted through a sandwich of two turbid cells can be considered ergodic even though only the second cell is ergodic. If absorption and/or leakage of light take place at the interface between the cells, we establish a so-called ""multiplication rule"", which relates the intensity autocorrelation function of light transmitted through the double-cell sandwich to the autocorrelation functions of individual cells by a simple multiplication. To test the proposed method, we perform a series of DWS experiments using colloidal gels as model nonergodic media.

The formula is in excellent agreement with the Dow-Jones index for the time lags from 1 to 250 trading days. For large returns, the distribution is exponential in log-returns with a time-dependent exponent, whereas for small returns it is Gaussian.

As with the quasispecies model, our model for mutator-nonmutator equilibrium undergoes a phase transition in the limit of infinite sequence length. This ""repair catastrophe"" occurs at a critical repair error probability of $ \epsilon_r = L_{via}/L $, where $ L_{via} $ denotes the length of the genome controlling viability, while $ L $ denotes the overall length of the genome.

The role of clustering and gridlike ordering in epidemic spreading,"Thomas Petermann, Paolo De Los Rios","The spreading of an epidemic is determined by the connectiviy patterns which underlie the population. While it has been noted that a virus spreads more easily on a network in which global distances are small, it remains a great challenge to find approaches that unravel the precise role of local interconnectedness. Such topological properties enter very naturally in the framework of our two-timestep description, also providing a novel approach to tract a probabilistic system.

A generalized Black-Scholes partial differential equation for this model is obtained, together with closed-form approximate solutions for the fair price of a European call option. In certain limits, the standard Black-Scholes model is recovered, as is the Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model of Cox and Ross. Alternative methods of solution to that model are thereby also discussed. The model parameters are partially fit from empirical observations of the distribution of the underlying.

Mathematical models of haploinsufficiency,"Indrani Bose, Rajesh Karmakar","We study simple mathematical models of gene expression to explore the possible origins of haploinsufficiency (HI). In a diploid organism, each gene exists in two copies and when one of these is mutated, the amount of proteins synthesized is reduced and may fall below a threshold level for the onset of some desired activity. This can give rise to HI, a manifestation of which is in the form of a disease. We consider both deterministic and stochastic models of gene expression and suggest possible scenarios for the occurrence of HI in the two cases. In the stochastic case, random fluctuations around the mean protein level give rise to a finite probability that the protein level falls below a threshold. Increased gene copy number and faster gene expression kinetics reduce the variance around the mean protein level. The difference between slow and fast gene expression kinetics, as regards response to a signaling gradient, is further pointed out.

In this study we investigate what effect different levels of travel restrictions may have on the speed and geographical spread of an outbreak of a disease similar to SARS. We use a stochastic simulation model of the Swedish population, calibrated with survey data of travel patterns between municipalities in Sweden collected over three years. We find that a ban on journeys longer than 50 km drastically reduces the speed and the geographical spread of outbreaks, even with when compliance is less than 100%. The result is found to be robust for different rates of inter-municipality transmission intensities.

The co-repressor inhibits the action of the activator in switching on target genes. We apply this system to Drosophila embryos, where we predict the existence of a hitherto undetected posterior co-repressor.

Stochastic models for tumoral growth,Carlos Escudero,"Strong experimental evidence has indicated that tumor growth belongs to the molecular beam epitaxy universality class. This type of growth is characterized by the constraint of cell proliferation to the tumor border, and surface diffusion of cells at the growing edge. Tumor growth is thus conceived as a competition for space between the tumor and the host, and cell diffusion at the tumor border is an optimal strategy adopted for minimizing the pressure and helping tumor development. Two stochastic partial differential equations are introduced in this work in order to correctly model the physical properties of tumoral growth in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions. The advantages of these models is that they reproduce the correct geometry of the tumor and are defined in terms of polar variables. Analysis of these models allow us to quantitatively estimate the response of the tumor to an unfavorable perturbation during the growth.",2006-03-07T16:53:51Z,2006-03-07T16:53:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0603009v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0603009v1,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.TO"

Within this framework, the computational difficulties related to the existence of large time scale gaps in the protein folding problem are removed and simulating the entire reaction in atomistic details using existing computers becomes feasible. In addition, this formalism provides a natural framework to investigate the relationships between thermodynamical and kinetic aspects of the folding. For example, it is possible to show that, in order to have a large probability to remain unchanged under Langevin diffusion, the native state has to be characterized by a small conformational entropy. We discuss how to determine the most probable folding pathway, to identify configurations representative of the transition state and to compute the most probable transition time.

"Positive Feedback, Stochasticity and Genetic Competence","Rajesh Karmakar, Indrani Bose","A single gene, regulating its own expression via a positive feedback loop, constitutes a common motif in gene regulatory networks and signalling cascades. Recent experiments on the development of competence in the bacterial population \emph{B. subtilis} show that the autoregulatory genetic module by itself can give rise to two types of cellular states. The states correspond to the low and high expression states of the master regulator ComK. The high expression state is attained when the ComK protein level exceeds a threshold value leading to a full activation of the autostimulatory loop. Stochasticity in gene expression drives the transitions between the two stable states. In this paper, we explain the appearance of bimodal protein distributions in \emph{B. subtilis} cell population in the framework of three possible scenarios. In two of the cases, bistability provides the basis for binary gene expression. In the third case, the system is monostable in a deterministic description and stochasticity in gene expression is solely responsible for the appearance of the two expression states.",2007-02-26T09:59:54Z,2007-02-26T09:59:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0702055v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0702055v1,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.OT"

We find similar results for two independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between corruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption.

The data reflects the dynamics in the underlying multi-substate on-off kinetic scheme (KS) of the process, but the determination of the underlying KS is difficult, and sometimes even impossible, due to the loss of information in the mapping of the mutli-dimensional KS onto two dimensions. A way to deal with this problem considers canonical (unique) forms. (Unique canonical form is constructed from an infinitely long trajectory, but many KSs.) Here we introduce canonical forms of reduced dimensions that can handle any KS (i.e. also KSs with symmetry and irreversible transitions). We give the mapping of KSs into reduced dimensions forms, which is based on topology of KSs, and the tools for extracting the reduced dimensions form from finite data.

Motivated by these fundamental questions on intracellular biological processes, we have developed a model for searching a specific site on a model DNA by a single protein. We have made a comparative quantitative study of the efficiencies of sliding, inter-segmental hoppings and detachment/re-attachments of the particle during its search for the specific site on the DNA.

Spacetime quantum states close to a classical null trajectory are approximated by plane wavefunctions of Planck wavelength (l_P) reference beams; these are used to connect transverse position operators at macroscopically separated events. Transverse positions of events with null spacetime separation, but separated by macroscopic spatial distance $L$, are shown to be quantum conjugate observables, leading to holographic indeterminacy and a new uncertainty principle, a lower bound on the standard deviation of relative transverse position \Delta x_\perp > \sqrt{l_PL} or angular orientation \Delta\theta > \sqrt{l_P/L}. The resulting limit on the number of independent degrees of freedom is shown to agree quantitatively with holographic covariant entropy bounds derived from black hole physics and string theory. The theory predicts a universal ``holographic noise'' of spacetime, appearing as shear perturbations with a frequency-independent power spectral density S_H=l_P/c, or in equivalent metric perturbation units, h_{H,rms} \sqrt{l_P/c} = 2.3 \times 10^{-22} /\sqrt{Hz}.

It may simultaneously resolve key anomalies relating to primordial lithium abundances, CMB ellipticity, the expansion age of the universe and the Hubble bubble feature. The model uses only general relativity, and matter obeying the strong energy condition, but revisits operational issues in interpreting average measurements in our presently inhomogeneous universe, from first principles.

Quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI typically involves the convolution of an arterial input function (AIF) with a nonlinear pharmacokinetic model of the contrast agent concentration. Parameters of the kinetic model are biologically meaningful, but the optimization of the non-linear model has significant computational issues. In practice, convergence of the optimization algorithm is not guaranteed and the accuracy of the model fitting may be compromised. To overcome this problems, this paper proposes a semi-parametric penalized spline smoothing approach, with which the AIF is convolved with a set of B-splines to produce a design matrix using locally adaptive smoothing parameters based on Bayesian penalized spline models (P-splines).

Here, we propose for the first time an analytical model of transport limited reactions in active media, and show quantitatively how active transport can enhance reactivity for large enough tracers like vesicles. We derive analytically the average interaction time with motor proteins which optimizes the reaction rate, and reveal remarkable universal features of the optimal configuration.

Our results can be viewed as providing a way of specializing the Picard group of a variety V over $\mathbb{Q}$ to obtain class groups for number fields $\mathbb{Q}(P)$, $P\in V(\Qbar)$, for certain families of points P. In particular, we show how the problem of constructing quadratic number fields with a large-rank ideal class group can be reduced to the problem of finding a hyperelliptic curve with a rational Weierstrass point and a large rational torsion subgroup in its Jacobian. Furthermore, we show how many previous results on constructing large-rank ideal class groups can be fit into our framework and rederived. As an application of our technique, we derive a quantitative version of a theorem of Nakano. This gives the best known general quantitative result on number fields with a large-rank ideal class group.",2008-05-09T14:50:53Z,2008-05-09T14:50:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1361v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1361v1,"math.NT, math.AG, 11R29, 14H40, 14K30"
Towards quantitative prediction of proteasomal digestion patterns of   proteins,"Denis S. Goldobin, Alexey Zaikin","We discuss the problem of proteasomal degradation of proteins. Though proteasomes are important for all aspects of the cellular metabolism, some details of the physical mechanism of the process remain unknown. We introduce a stochastic model of the proteasomal degradation of proteins, which accounts for the protein translocation and the topology of the positioning of cleavage centers of a proteasome from first principles. For this model we develop the mathematical description based on a master-equation and techniques for reconstruction of the cleavage specificity inherent to proteins and the proteasomal translocation rates, which are a property of the proteasome specie, from mass spectroscopy data on digestion patterns. With these properties determined, one can quantitatively predict digestion patterns for new experimental set-ups. Additionally we design an experimental set-up for a synthetic polypeptide with a periodic sequence of amino acids, which enables especially reliable determination of translocation rates.",2008-06-16T14:49:47Z,2008-06-16T14:49:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2594v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.2594v1,"q-bio.SC, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph"

By introducing an evolutionary stability assumption on the distribution of phenotype and genotype, we establish quantitative relationships on plasticity, phenotypic fluctuations, and evolvability. Derived are proportionality among plasticity as a responsiveness of phenotype against environmental change, variances of phenotype fluctuations of genetic and developmental origins, and evolution speed.

Modeling Microscopic Chemical Sensors in Capillaries,Tad Hogg,"Nanotechnology-based microscopic robots could provide accurate in vivo measurement of chemicals in the bloodstream for detailed biological research and as an aid to medical treatment. Quantitative performance estimates of such devices require models of how chemicals in the blood diffuse to the devices. This paper models microscopic robots and red blood cells (erythrocytes) in capillaries using realistic distorted cell shapes. The models evaluate two sensing scenarios: robots moving with the cells past a chemical source on the vessel wall, and robots attached to the wall for longer-term chemical monitoring. Using axial symmetric geometry with realistic flow speeds and diffusion coefficients, we compare detection performance with a simpler model that does not include the cells. The average chemical absorption is quantitatively similar in both models, indicating the simpler model is an adequate design guide to sensor performance in capillaries.

Quantitative asymptotics of graphical projection pursuit,Elizabeth Meckes,"There is a result of Diaconis and Freedman which says that, in a limiting sense, for large collections of high-dimensional data most one-dimensional projections of the data are approximately Gaussian.

For a set of deterministic vectors $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ in $\R^d$ with $n$ and $d$ fixed, let $\theta\in\s^{d-1}$ be a random point of the sphere and let $\mu_n^\theta$ denote the random measure which puts mass $\frac{1}{n}$ at each of the points $\inprod{x_1}{\theta},...,\inprod{x_n}{\theta}$. For a fixed bounded Lipschitz test function $f$, $Z$ a standard Gaussian random variable and $\sigma^2$ a suitable constant, an explicit bound is derived for the quantity $\ds\P[|\int f d\mu_n^\theta-\E f(\sigma Z)|>\epsilon]$. A bound is also given for $\ds\P[d_{BL}(\mu_n^\theta, N(0,\sigma^2))>\epsilon]$, where $d_{BL}$ denotes the bounded-Lipschitz distance, which yields a lower bound on the waiting time to finding a non-Gaussian projection of the $\{x_i\}$ if directions are tried independently and uniformly on $\s^{d-1}$.",2008-11-17T18:30:39Z,2009-04-20T17:29:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2769v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2769v2,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
Stochasticity and traffic jams in the transcription of ribosomal RNA:   Intriguing role of termination and antitermination,"Stefan Klumpp, Terence Hwa","In fast growing bacteria, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is required to be transcribed at very high rates to sustain the high cellular demand on ribosome synthesis. This results in dense traffic of RNA polymerases (RNAP). We developed a stochastic model, integrating results of single-molecule and quantitative in vivo studies of E. coli, to evaluate the quantitative effect of pausing, termination, and antitermination on rRNA transcription. Our calculations reveal that in dense RNAP traffic, spontaneous pausing of RNAP can lead to severe ""traffic jams"", as manifested in the broad distribution of inter-RNAP distances and can be a major factor limiting transcription and hence growth. Our results suggest the suppression of these pauses by the ribosomal antitermination complex to be essential at fast growth. Moreover, unsuppressed pausing by even a few non-antiterminated RNAPs can already reduce transcription drastically under dense traffic. However, the termination factor Rho can remove the non-antiterminated RNAPs and restore fast transcription. The results thus suggest an intriguing role by Rho to enhance rather than attenuate rRNA transcription.",2008-11-19T17:49:52Z,2008-11-19T17:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3163v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3163v1,"q-bio.SC, cond-mat.stat-mech"

Unlike animals and other biological systems, humans form groups in both real (offline) and virtual (online) spaces -- from potentially dangerous street gangs populated mostly by disaffected male youths, through to the massive global guilds in online role-playing games for which membership currently exceeds tens of millions of people from all possible backgrounds, age-groups and genders. We have compiled and analyzed data for these two seemingly unrelated offline and online human activities, and have uncovered an unexpected quantitative link between them. Although their overall dynamics differ visibly, we find that a common team-based model can accurately reproduce the quantitative features of each simply by adjusting the average tolerance level and attribute range for each population. By contrast, we find no evidence to support a version of the model based on like-seeking-like (i.e. kinship or `homophily').",2008-12-12T06:46:15Z,2009-10-08T22:06:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2299v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.2299v2,"physics.soc-ph, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.PE"

This implies that the hitting time associated to the flow satisfies a logarithm law. The hitting time $\tau_r(x,x_0)$ is the time needed for the orbit of a point $x$ to enter for the first time in a ball $B_r(x_0)$ centered at $x_0$, with small radius $r$. As the radius of the ball decreases to 0 its asymptotic behavior is a power law whose exponent is related to the local dimension of the SRB measure at $x_0$: for each $x_0$ such that the local dimension $d_{\mu}(x_0)$ exists, \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{\log \tau_r(x,x_0)}{-\log r} = d_{\mu}(x_0)-1 holds for $\mu$ almost each $x$.

We combine these lower and upper bounds in different forms of intrinsic Harnack inequalities, which are new in the very fast diffusion range, that is when $1<p \le 2n/(n+1)$.

Information geometry and entropy in a stochastic epidemic rate process,C. T. J.

They found that variability in these random variables had opposite effects on the epidemic growth rate. That rate increased with greater variability in latency but decreased with greater variability in infectivity. Here we extend their result by using the McKay bivariate gamma distribution for the joint distribution of latency and infectivity, recovering the above effects of variability but allowing possible correlation. We use methods of stochastic rate processes to obtain explicit solutions for the growth of the epidemic and the evolution of the inhomogeneity and information entropy. We obtain a closed analytic solution to the evolution of the distribution of the number of uninfected individuals as the epidemic proceeds, and a concomitant expression for the decay of entropy. The family of McKay bivariate gamma distributions has a tractable information geometry which provides a framework in which the evolution of distributions can be studied as the outbreak grows, with a natural distance structure for quantitative tracking of progress.",2009-03-17T16:17:52Z,2010-12-16T11:41:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2997v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.2997v2,"q-bio.PE, q-bio.QM, 92B05, 92C60, 65C50"

Quantum parallelism facilitates simultaneous training and revision of the system within this coherent state space, resulting in accelerated convergence to a stable network attractor under consequent iteration of the implemented backpropagation algorithm.

This effect is now understood qualitatively by modern synchronization theory (M. Abel et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 119(4), 2006). For a detailed, quantitative investigation, we substituted one pipe by an electric speaker. We observe that even minute driving signals force the pipe to synchronization, thus yielding three decades of synchronization -- the largest range ever measured to our knowledge. Furthermore, a mutual silencing of the pipe is found, which can be explained by self-organized oscillations, of use for novel methods of noise abatement.

Redundancy for localized and Gabor frames,"Radu Balan, Pete Casazza, Zeph Landau","Redundancy is the qualitative property which makes Hilbert space frames so useful in practice. However, developing a meaningful quantitative notion of redundancy for infinite frames has proven elusive. Though quantitative candidates for redundancy exist, the main open problem is whether a frame with redundancy greater than one contains a subframe with redundancy arbitrarily close to one. We will answer this question in the affirmative for $\ell^1$-localized frames. We then specialize our results to Gabor multi-frames with generators in $M^1(\R^d)$, and Gabor molecules with envelopes in $W(C,l^1)$. As a main tool in this work, we show there is a universal function $g(x)$ so that for every $\epsilon>0$, every Parseval frame $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^M$ for an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $H_N$ has a subset of fewer than $(1+\epsilon)N$ elements which is a frame for $H_N$ with lower frame bound $g(\epsilon/(2\frac{M}{N}-1))$. This work provides the first meaningful quantative notion of redundancy for a large class of infinite frames.

The means to achieve these properties is to consider the maximum and minimum of a redundancy function, which is interesting in itself. The redundancy function is defined on the sphere of the Hilbert space and measures the concentration of frame vectors around each point.

Extinction in neutrally stable stochastic Lotka-Volterra models,"A. Dobrinevski, E.

The processes leading to extinction of species, whose understanding is a key component in the study of evolution and biodiversity, are influenced by both of these factors.   In this paper, we investigate a class of stochastic population dynamics models based on generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. In the case of neutral stability of the underlying deterministic model, the impact of intrinsic noise on the survival of species is dramatic: it destroys coexistence of interacting species on a time scale proportional to the population size. We introduce a new method based on stochastic averaging which allows one to understand this extinction process quantitatively by reduction to a lower-dimensional effective dynamics. This is performed analytically for two highly symmetrical models and can be generalized numerically to more complex situations.

In this paper a fully implicit numerical method is proposed, analyzed and numerically tested for parabolic equations of porous media type and on a systems of two PDEs that models the sulfation of marble in monuments. Due to the nonlinear nature of the underlying mathematical model, the use of a fixed point scheme is required and every step implies the solution of large, locally structured, linear systems.

Automatic Probabilistic Program Verification through Random Variable   Abstraction,"Damián Barsotti, Nicolás Wolovick","The weakest pre-expectation calculus has been proved to be a mature theory to analyze quantitative properties of probabilistic and nondeterministic programs. We present an automatic method for proving quantitative linear properties on any denumerable state space using iterative backwards fixed point calculation in the general framework of abstract interpretation. In order to accomplish this task we present the technique of random variable abstraction (RVA) and we also postulate a sufficient condition to achieve exact fixed point computation in the abstract domain. The feasibility of our approach is shown with two examples, one obtaining the expected running time of a probabilistic program, and the other the expected gain of a gambling strategy.   Our method works on general guarded probabilistic and nondeterministic transition systems instead of plain pGCL programs, allowing us to easily model a wide range of systems including distributed ones and unstructured programs.

Binary neutron-star mergers with Whisky and SACRA: First quantitative   comparison of results from independent general-relativistic hydrodynamics   codes,"Luca Baiotti, Masaru Shibata, Tetsuro Yamamoto","We present the first quantitative comparison of two independent general-relativistic hydrodynamics codes, the Whisky code and the SACRA code. We compare the output of simulations starting from the same initial data and carried out with the configuration (numerical methods, grid setup, resolution, gauges) which for each code has been found to give consistent and sufficiently accurate results, in particular in terms of cleanness of gravitational waveforms. We focus on the quantities that should be conserved during the evolution (rest mass, total mass energy, and total angular momentum) and on the gravitational-wave amplitude and frequency. We find that the results produced by the two codes agree at a reasonable level, with variations in the different quantities but always at better than about 10%.",2010-07-11T03:34:15Z,2010-09-11T01:23:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1754v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.1754v2,"gr-qc, astro-ph.IM"
Empirical results for pedestrian dynamics and their implications for   cellular automata models,"Andreas Schadschneider, Armin Seyfried","A large number of models for pedestrian dynamics have been developed over the years. However, so far not much attention has been paid to their quantitative validation. Usually the focus is on the reproduction of empirically observed collective phenomena, as lane formation in counterflow. This can give an indication for the realism of the model, but practical applications, e.g. in safety analysis, require quantitative predictions. We discuss the current experimental situation, especially for the fundamental diagram which is the most important quantity needed for calibration. In addition we consider the implications for the modelling based on cellular automata. As specific example the floor field model is introduced. Apart from the properties of its fundamental diagram we discuss the implications of an egress experiment for the relevance of conflicts and friction effects.",2010-07-23T07:51:31Z,2010-07-23T07:51:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4058v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.4058v1,"physics.soc-ph, nlin.CG"

Analysis Of Cancer Omics Data In A Semantic Web Framework,"Matt Holford, James McCusker, Kei Cheung, Michael Krauthammer","Our work concerns the elucidation of the cancer (epi)genome, transcriptome and proteome to better understand the complex interplay between a cancer cell's molecular state and its response to anti-cancer therapy. To study the problem, we have previously focused on data warehousing technologies and statistical data integration. In this paper, we present recent work on extending our analytical capabilities using Semantic Web technology. A key new component presented here is a SPARQL endpoint to our existing data warehouse. This endpoint allows the merging of observed quantitative data with existing data from semantic knowledge sources such as Gene Ontology (GO). We show how such variegated quantitative and functional data can be integrated and accessed in a universal manner using Semantic Web tools.

Accurate prediction of gene expression by integration of DNA sequence   statistics with detailed modeling of transcription regulation,Jose M. G. Vilar,"Gene regulation involves a hierarchy of events that extend from specific protein-DNA interactions to the combinatorial assembly of nucleoprotein complexes. The effects of DNA sequence on these processes have typically been studied based either on its quantitative connection with single-domain binding free energies or on empirical rules that combine different DNA motifs to predict gene expression trends on a genomic scale. The middle-point approach that quantitatively bridges these two extremes, however, remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide an integrated approach to accurately predict gene expression from statistical sequence information in combination with detailed biophysical modeling of transcription regulation by multidomain binding on multiple DNA sites. For the regulation of the prototypical lac operon, this approach predicts within 0.3-fold accuracy transcriptional activity over a 10,000-fold range from DNA sequence statistics for different intracellular conditions.",2010-12-16T14:06:26Z,2010-12-16T14:06:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3607v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3607v1,"q-bio.MN, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.CE, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.SC"

It prompts one to track evolved complexity starting from live astrophysically-observed processes, rather than only from evidence of past events.

Root development is extensively studied at cellular resolution to understand basic mechanisms underlying pattern formation and maintenance in plants. Unfortunately, ensuring continuous specimen access, while preserving physiological conditions and preventing photo-damage, poses major barriers to measurements of cellular dynamics in indeterminately growing organs such as plant roots. We present a system that integrates optical sectioning through light sheet fluorescence microscopy with hydroponic culture that enables us to image at cellular resolution a vertically growing Arabidopsis root every few minutes and for several consecutive days.

Here L describes the loss amount of the present risk profile and S describes the loss amount caused by an additional loss factor. We obtain different types of results according to the relative magnitudes of the thicknesses of the tails of L and S.

Map equation for link community,"Youngdo Kim, Hawoong Jeong","Community structure exists in many real-world networks and has been reported being related to several functional properties of the networks. The conventional approach was partitioning nodes into communities, while some recent studies start partitioning links instead of nodes to find overlapping communities of nodes efficiently. We extended the map equation method, which was originally developed for node communities, to find link communities in networks. This method is tested on various kinds of networks and compared with the metadata of the networks, and the results show that our method can identify the overlapping role of nodes effectively. The advantage of this method is that the node community scheme and link community scheme can be compared quantitatively by measuring the unknown information left in the networks besides the community structure. It can be used to decide quantitatively whether or not the link community scheme should be used instead of the node community scheme. Furthermore, this method can be easily extended to the directed and weighted networks since it is based on the random walk.",2011-05-02T08:04:27Z,2011-08-12T01:31:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0257v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.0257v2,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.SI"

Using the prototypic test compound acetone we demonstrate that the end-tidal breath profiles of such substances during isothermal rebreathing show characteristics that contradict the conventional pulmonary inert gas elimination theory due to Farhi. On the other hand, these profiles can reliably be captured by virtue of a previously developed mathematical model for the general exhalation kinetics of highly soluble, blood-borne VOCs, which explicitly takes into account airway gas exchange as major determinant of the observable breath output.   This model allows for a mechanistic analysis of various rebreathing protocols suggested in the literature. In particular, it clarifies the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo blood-breath ratios of hydrophilic VOCs and yields further quantitative insights into the physiological components of isothermal rebreathing.",2011-05-04T16:20:02Z,2011-12-16T15:30:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0864v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.0864v2,"q-bio.QM, physics.med-ph"
Electric field variability and classifications of Titan's magnetoplasma   environment,"Chris Arridge, Nick Achilleos, Patrick Guio","The atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon Titan is driven by photochemistry, charged particle precipitation from Saturn's upstream magnetosphere, and presumably by the diffusion of the magnetospheric field into the outer ionosphere, amongst other processes. Ion pickup, controlled by the upstream convection electric field, plays a role in the loss of this atmosphere. The interaction of Titan with Saturn's magnetosphere results in the formation of a flow-induced magnetosphere. The upstream magnetoplasma environment of Titan is a complex and highly variable system and significant quasi-periodic modulations of the plasma in this region of Saturn's magnetosphere have been reported. In this paper we quantitatively investigate the effect of these quasi-periodic modulations on the convection electric field at Titan. We show that the electric field can be significantly perturbed away from the nominal radial orientation inferred from Voyager 1 observations, and demonstrate that upstream categorisation schemes must be used with care when undertaking quantitative studies of Titan's magnetospheric interaction, particularly where assumptions regarding the orientation of the convection electric field are made.",2011-05-12T15:27:11Z,2011-05-12T15:27:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2505v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.2505v1,"astro-ph.EP, physics.space-ph"

Their use is reviewed and developed through analysis of various magnetic structures in such dots. Simple Landau configuration is used to investigate various aspects of asymmetric Bloch domain walls. The experimental width of such a complex wall is first derived and its value is discussed with the help of micromagnetic simulations. Combination of these two approaches enables us to define what is really extracted when estimating asymmetric wall width in Lorentz Microscopy. Moreover, quantitative data on the magnetization inside the dot is retrieved using phase retrieval as well as new informations on the degrees of freedom of such walls. Finally, it is shown how the existence and the propagation of a surface vortex can be characterized and monitored. This demonstrates the ability to reach a magnetic sensitivity a priori hidden in Fresnel contrast, based on an original image treatment and backed-up by the evaluation of contrasts obtained from micromagnetic simulations.",2011-05-31T14:20:28Z,2011-12-16T08:37:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6295v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.6295v2,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.ins-det"

To explore societal response to external perturbations we identified real-time changes in communication and mobility patterns in the vicinity of eight emergencies, such as bomb attacks and earthquakes, comparing these with eight non-emergencies, like concerts and sporting events. We find that communication spikes accompanying emergencies are both spatially and temporally localized, but information about emergencies spreads globally, resulting in communication avalanches that engage in a significant manner the social network of eyewitnesses. These results offer a quantitative view of behavioral changes in human activity under extreme conditions, with potential long-term impact on emergency detection and response.",2011-06-03T04:12:48Z,2011-06-03T04:12:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0560v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.0560v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI, physics.data-an"
Improvements for Free,"Daniel Seidel, Janis Voigtländer","""Theorems for Free!"" (Wadler, FPCA 1989) is a slogan for a technique that allows to derive statements about functions just from their types. So far, the statements considered have always had a purely extensional flavor: statements relating the value semantics of program expressions, but not statements relating their runtime (or other) cost. Here we study an extension of the technique that allows precisely statements of the latter flavor, by deriving quantitative theorems for free. After developing the theory, we walk through a number of example derivations. Probably none of the statements derived in those simple examples will be particularly surprising to most readers, but what is maybe surprising, and at the very least novel, is that there is a general technique for obtaining such results on a quantitative level in a principled way. Moreover, there is good potential to bring that technique to bear on more complex examples as well.

Visualization of nano-plasmons in graphene,"Hari Dahal, Rodrigo A. Muniz, Stephan Haas, Matthias J. Graf, Alexander V.

The collective excitations of induced charge density modulations in graphene are drastically changed in the vicinity of a single impurity compared to graphene's bulk behavior. The dispersion of nano-plasmons depends on the number of electrons and the sign, strength and size of the impurity potential. Due to this rich parameter space the calculated dispersions are intrinsically multidimensional requiring an advanced visualization tool for their efficient analysis, which can be achieved with parallel rendering. To overcome the problem of analyzing thousands of very complex spatial patterns of nano-plasmonic modes, we take a combined visual and quantitative approach to investigate the excitations on the two-dimensional graphene lattice.

Tao has proved a quantitative version of this theorem: given a uniform bound on the rates of metastable convergence in the hypothesis, there is a bound on the rate of metastable convergence in the conclusion that is independent of the sequence (f_n) and the underlying space. We prove a slight strengthening of Tao's theorem which, moreover, provides an explicit description of the second bound in terms of the first. Specifically, we show that when the first bound is given by a continuous functional, the bound in the conclusion can be computed by a recursion along the tree of unsecured sequences.

This amounts to studying the response of the market when introducing a trader who buys or sells a fixed amount h for a finite time T. This perturbation introduces statistical arbitrages that traders exploit by adapting their trading strategies. The market impact depends on the nature of the stationary state: We find that the permanent impact is zero in the unpredictable (information efficient) phase, while in the predictable phase it is non-zero and grows linearly with the size of the meta-order. This establishes a quantitative link between information efficiency and trading efficiency (i.e. market impact). By using statistical mechanics methods for disordered systems, we are able to fully characterize the response in the predictable phase, to relate execution cost to response functions and obtain exact results for the permanent impact.",2011-12-16T18:13:37Z,2012-11-21T14:36:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3908v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.3908v2,"q-fin.TR, cond-mat.stat-mech"

Quantitative information on the distribution of the Q^n tetrahedral units was obtained by fitting the emissivity spectra using a dielectric function model (DFM). The DFM is based on causal Gaussian bands, associated with the stretching motions of the silicate tetrahedra. The changes in the absorption modes are related to the activation of a dynamical disorder that continuously increases with temperature. The obtained Q^n speciation at room temperature is in good agreement with the magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) study. The distribution of the tetrahedral species undergoes slight changes with temperature, except during glass crystallization where Q^4 units increases, with a slight augmentation of Q^2 and Q^4 units in the melt.

Diffusion properties of single FoF1-ATP synthases in a living bacterium   unraveled by localization microscopy,"Marc Renz, Torsten Rendler, Michael Boersch","FoF1-ATP synthases in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria are membrane-bound enzymes which use an internal proton-driven rotary double motor to catalyze the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). According to the 'chemiosmotic hypothesis', a series of proton pumps generate the necessary pH difference plus an electric potential across the bacterial plasma membrane. These proton pumps are redox-coupled membrane enzymes which are possibly organized in supercomplexes, as shown for the related enzymes in the mitochondrial inner membrane. We report diffusion measurements of single fluorescent FoF1-ATP synthases in living E. coli by localization microscopy and single enzyme tracking to distinguish a monomeric enzyme from a supercomplex-associated form in the bacterial membrane. For quantitative mean square displacement (MSD) analysis, the limited size of the observation area in the membrane with a significant membrane curvature had to be considered.

Microtubule tracking from stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy   images,"Juliane Liepe, Federico Felizzi, Agata Pernus, Maria Hanulova","Our work aims at using quantitative imaging tools to complement the limitation of noise encountered by high resolution fluorescence microscopy methods. Several cycles of fluorophore activation, imaging and deactivation produce a sequence of images in which the signals of individual fluorophores do not overlap, due to the low light intensity during their activation. The centroid position of each fluorophore is then determined by Gaussian fitting of each signal, where the final resolution depends on the precision with which each fluorphore is localized. Superimposing the images will result in having the same fluorophore mapped onto a `cloud' of locations. The most significant information of the superimposed images is contained in the macro-structures identifying microtubules, mitochondria or other organelles. Cascades of binary image processing algorithms are applied in order to isolate the larger organelles. A Markovian algorithm selecting the nearest neighbour is finally applied to the de-noised images, to automatically extract relevant information on microtubules. Our work supplements advancements in experimental technologies with computational methods, helping quantifying sub-cellular properties with high accuracy.",2012-02-02T10:57:14Z,2012-02-02T10:57:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0407v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.0407v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph"

Recent studies have shown that electromagnetic scattering solutions can be fit to digital holograms to obtain the 3D positions of isolated colloidal spheres with nanometer precision and millisecond temporal resolution. Here we describe the results of new techniques that extend the range of systems that can be studied with fitting. We show that an exact multisphere superposition scattering solution can be used to fit holograms of colloidal clusters containing up to six spheres. We also introduce an approximate and computationally simpler solution, Mie superposition, that is valid for multiple spheres spaced several wavelengths or more from one another.

In a previous paper published in September 2011, we constructed for the first time a dynamic model that quantitatively agreed with food prices. Specifically, the model fit the FAO Food Price Index time series from January 2004 to March 2011, inclusive. The results showed that the dominant causes of price increases during this period were investor speculation and ethanol conversion. The model included investor trend following as well as shifting between commodities, equities and bonds to take advantage of increased expected returns. Here, we extend the food prices model to January 2012, without modifying the model but simply continuing its dynamics. The agreement is still precise, validating both the descriptive and predictive abilities of the analysis.

We examine the dependence of the IP on the number of unoccupied states used to build the dielectric function and the self energy, as well as the dielectric function plane-wave cutoff. We find that with an effective completion strategy for approximating the unoccupied subspace, and a converged dielectric function kinetic energy cutoff, the computed IPs and EAs are in excellent quantitative agreement with available experiment (within 0.2 eV), indicating that a one-shot $G_0W_0$ approach can be very accurate for calculating addition/removal energies of small organic molecules.

Quantitative Concept Analysis,Dusko Pavlovic,"Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) begins from a context, given as a binary relation between some objects and some attributes, and derives a lattice of concepts, where each concept is given as a set of objects and a set of attributes, such that the first set consists of all objects that satisfy all attributes in the second, and vice versa. Many applications, though, provide contexts with quantitative information, telling not just whether an object satisfies an attribute, but also quantifying this satisfaction. Contexts in this form arise as rating matrices in recommender systems, as occurrence matrices in text analysis, as pixel intensity matrices in digital image processing, etc. Such applications have attracted a lot of attention, and several numeric extensions of FCA have been proposed. We propose the framework of proximity sets (proxets), which subsume partially ordered sets (posets) as well as metric spaces. One feature of this approach is that it extracts from quantified contexts quantified concepts, and thus allows full use of the available information. Another feature is that the categorical approach allows analyzing any universal properties that the classical FCA and the new versions may have, and thus provides structural guidance for aligning and combining the approaches.",2012-04-26T01:35:10Z,2012-04-26T01:35:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5802v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.5802v1,"cs.LG, math.CT, 18D20, 06B23, I.2.6"

This problem is primarily motivated by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, of which the goal is to discover genetic variations in the genome (inputs) that influence the expression levels of multiple co-expressed genes (outputs), either epistatically, or pleiotropically, or both. A structured input-output lasso (SIOL) model based on an intricate l1/l2-norm penalty over the regression coefficient matrix is employed to enable discovery of complex sparse input/output relationships; and a highly efficient new optimization algorithm called hierarchical group thresholding (HiGT) is developed to solve the resultant non-differentiable, non-separable, and ultra high-dimensional optimization problem. We show on both simulation and on a yeast eQTL dataset that our model leads to significantly better recovery of the structured sparse relationships between the inputs and the outputs, and our algorithm significantly outperforms other optimization techniques under the same model.

On the origin of the unusual behavior in the stretching of   single-stranded DNA,"Ngo Minh Toan, D. Thirumalai","Force extension curves (FECs), which quantify the response of a variety of biomolecules subject to mechanical force ($f$), are often quantitatively fit using worm-like chain (WLC) or freely-jointed chain (FJC) models. These models predict that the chain extension, $x$, normalized by the contour length increases linearly at small $f$ and at high forces scale as $x \sim (1 - f^{-\alpha})$ where $\alpha$= 0.5 for WLC and unity for FJC. In contrast, experiments on ssDNA show that over a range of $f$ and ionic concentration, $x$ scales as $x\sim\ln f$, which cannot be explained using WLC or FJC models. Using theory and simulations we show that this unusual behavior in FEC in ssDNA is due to sequence-independent polyelectrolyte effects. We show that the $x\sim \ln f$ arises because in the absence of force the tangent correlation function, quantifying chain persistence, decays algebraically on length scales on the order of the Debye length. Our theory, which is most appropriate for monovalent salts, quantitatively fits the experimental data and further predicts that such a regime is not discernible in double stranded DNA.",2012-05-30T12:50:42Z,2012-05-31T16:07:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6650v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6650v2,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.BM"

The relevant astrobiological parameters are to be modeled as the elements of the input probability matrix for the PCA kernel. With the underlying simplicity of the cellular automata constructs, this approach enables a quick analysis of large and ambiguous input parameters' space. We perform a simple clustering analysis of typical astrobiological histories and discuss the relevant boundary conditions of practical importance for planning and guiding actual empirical astrobiological and SETI projects.

We present formulae for the expected cardinality of the set of neighbors for these graphs, and present tail bounds on the probability that this cardinality will be less than the expected value.

Asymptotic Generalization Bound of Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis,"Wei Bian, Dacheng Tao","Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) is an important dimension reduction method in statistical pattern recognition. It has been shown that FLDA is asymptotically Bayes optimal under the homoscedastic Gaussian assumption. However, this classical result has the following two major limitations: 1) it holds only for a fixed dimensionality $D$, and thus does not apply when $D$ and the training sample size $N$ are proportionally large; 2) it does not provide a quantitative description on how the generalization ability of FLDA is affected by $D$ and $N$. In this paper, we present an asymptotic generalization analysis of FLDA based on random matrix theory, in a setting where both $D$ and $N$ increase and $D/N\longrightarrow\gamma\in[0,1)$. The obtained lower bound of the generalization discrimination power overcomes both limitations of the classical result, i.e., it is applicable when $D$ and $N$ are proportionally large and provides a quantitative description of the generalization ability of FLDA in terms of the ratio $\gamma=D/N$ and the population discrimination power. Besides, the discrimination power bound also leads to an upper bound on the generalization error of binary-classification with FLDA.",2012-08-15T05:35:36Z,2013-04-22T04:12:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3030v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.3030v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG"

Here, as an extension of our recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 148101 (2011)], we study how input fluctuations affect the stochastic dynamics of a simple biological switch. In our model, the on transition rate of the switch is directly regulated by a noisy input signal, which is described as a nonnegative mean-reverting diffusion process. This continuous process can be a good approximation of the discrete birth-death process and is much more analytically tractable. Within this new setup, we apply the Feynman-Kac theorem to investigate the statistical features of the output switching dynamics. Consistent with our previous findings, the input noise is found to effectively suppress the input-dependent transitions.

In this perspective, we first show that single molecule pulling experiments when combined with with theory and simulations can be used to quantitatively explore the folding landscape of nucleic acid hairpins, and riboswitches with tertiary interactions. Applications to riboswitches, which are non-coding RNA elements that control gene expression by undergoing dynamical conformational changes in response to binding of metabolites, lead to an organization principle that assembly of RNA is determined by the stability of isolated helices. We also point out the limitations of single molecule pulling experiments, with molecular extension as the only accessible parameter, in extracting key parameters of the folding landscapes of RNA molecules.",2012-11-28T01:20:04Z,2012-11-28T01:20:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6493v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.6493v1,"q-bio.BM, cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph"
Towards the full information chain theory: question difficulty,"Eugene Perevalov, David Grace","A general problem of optimal information acquisition for its use in decision making problems is considered. This motivates the need for developing quantitative measures of information sources' capabilities for supplying accurate information depending on the particular content of the latter. In this article, the notion of a real valued difficulty functional for questions identified with partitions of problem parameter space is introduced and the overall form of this functional is derived that satisfies a particular system of reasonable postulates. It is found that, in an isotropic case, the resulting difficulty functional depends on a single scalar function on the parameter space that can be interpreted -- using parallels with classical thermodynamics -- as a temperature-like quantity, with the question difficulty itself playing the role of thermal energy. Quantitative relationships between difficulty functionals of different questions are also explored.",2012-12-12T03:19:32Z,2013-02-14T19:08:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2693v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.2693v2,"physics.data-an, cs.IT, math.IT"
Quantitative description of ion transport via plasma membrane of yeast   and small cells,Vadim Volkov,"Modeling of ion transport via plasma membrane needs identification and quantitative understanding of the involved processes. Brief characterization of main ion transport systems of a yeast cell (Pma1, Ena1, TOK1, Nha1, Trk1, Trk2, non-selective cation conductance) and determining the exact number of molecules of each transporter per a typical cell allow us to predict the corresponding ion flows. In this review a comparison of ion transport in small yeast cell and several animal cell types is provided. The importance of cell volume to surface ratio is emphasized. The role of cell wall and lipid rafts is discussed in respect to required increase in spatial and temporal resolution of measurements.

Figueira de Morisson Faria","We perform a Bohmian-trajectory analysis of high-order harmonic generation (HHG), focusing on the fact that typical HHG spectra are best reproduced by the Bohmian trajectory starting at the innermost part of the core [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{88}, 023415 (2013)]. Using ensemble averages around this central trajectory, we show that, for the high-plateau and cutoff harmonics, small ensembles of Bohmian trajectories are sufficient for a quantitative agreement with the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE), while larger ensembles are necessary in the low-plateau region. Furthermore, we relate the Bohmian trajectories to the ""short"" and ""long"" trajectories encountered in the Strong-Field Approximation (SFA), and show that the time-frequency maps from the central Bohmian trajectory overestimate the contributions of the long SFA trajectory, in comparison to the outcome of the TDSE computations.

Molecular motors robustly drive active gels to a critically connected   state,"Jose Alvarado, Michael Sheinman, Abhinav Sharma, Fred C. MacKintosh, Gijsje H. Koenderink","Living systems often exhibit internal driving: active, molecular processes drive nonequilibrium phenomena such as metabolism or migration. Active gels constitute a fascinating class of internally driven matter, where molecular motors exert localized stresses inside polymer networks. There is evidence that network crosslinking is required to allow motors to induce macroscopic contraction. Yet a quantitative understanding of how network connectivity enables contraction is lacking. Here we show experimentally that myosin motors contract crosslinked actin polymer networks to clusters with a scale-free size distribution. This critical behavior occurs over an unexpectedly broad range of crosslink concentrations. To understand this robustness, we develop a quantitative model of contractile networks that takes into account network restructuring: motors reduce connectivity by forcing crosslinks to unbind. Paradoxically, to coordinate global contractions, motor activity should be low. Otherwise, motors drive initially well-connected networks to a critical state where ruptures form across the entire network.",2013-02-12T14:14:49Z,2013-02-12T14:14:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2798v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.2798v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft, q-bio.SC"

Quantitative analysis of the evolution of novelty in cinema through   crowdsourced keywords,Sameet Sreenivasan,"The generation of novelty is central to any creative endeavor. Novelty generation and the relationship between novelty and individual hedonic value have long been subjects of study in social psychology. However, few studies have utilized large-scale datasets to quantitatively investigate these issues. Here we consider the domain of American cinema and explore these questions using a database of films spanning a 70 year period. We use crowdsourced keywords from the Internet Movie Database as a window into the contents of films, and prescribe novelty scores for each film based on occurrence probabilities of individual keywords and keyword-pairs. These scores provide revealing insights into the dynamics of novelty in cinema. We investigate how novelty influences the revenue generated by a film, and find a relationship that resembles the Wundt-Berlyne curve. We also study the statistics of keyword occurrence and the aggregate distribution of keywords over a 100 year period.",2013-04-02T20:14:54Z,2013-10-04T17:03:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0786v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0786v3,"physics.soc-ph, cs.CY"
An analysis of a large dataset on immigrant integration in Spain. The   Statistical Mechanics perspective on Social Action,"Adriano Barra, Pierluigi Contucci, Rickard Sandell, Cecilia Vernia","How does immigrant integration in a country change with immigration density? Guided by a statistical mechanics perspective we propose a novel approach to this problem. The analysis focuses on classical integration quantifiers such as the percentage of jobs (temporary and permanent) given to immigrants, mixed marriages, and newborns with parents of mixed origin. We find that the average values of different quantifi?ers may exhibit either linear or non-linear growth on immigrant density and we suggest that social action, a concept identified by Max Weber, causes the observed non- linearity. Using the statistical mechanics notion of interaction to quantitatively emulate social action, a unified mathematical model for integration is proposed and it is shown to explain both growth behaviors observed. The linear theory instead, ignoring the possibility of interaction effects would underestimate the quantifiers up to 30% when immigrant densities are low, and overestimate them as much when densities are high. The capacity to quantitatively isolate different types of integration mechanisms makes our framework a suitable tool in the quest for more efficient integration policies.",2013-04-16T10:45:27Z,2014-02-28T13:35:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4392v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.4392v2,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn"
The derivative discontinuity in the strong-interaction limit of density   functional theory,"André Mirtschink, Michael Seidl, Paola Gori-Giorgi","We generalize the exact strong-interaction limit of the exchange-correlation energy of Kohn-Sham density functional theory to open systems with fluctuating particle numbers. When used in the self-consistent Kohn-Sham procedure on strongly-interacting systems, this functional yields exact features crucial for important applications such as electronic transport. In particular, the step-like structure of the highest-occupied Kohn-Sham eigenvalue is very well captured, with accurate quantitative agreement with exact many-body chemical potentials. Whilst it can be shown that a sharp derivative discontinuity is only present in the infinitely strong-correlated limit, at finite correlation regimes we observe a slightly-smoothened discontinuity, with qualitative and quantitative features that improve with increasing correlation. From the fundamental point of view, our results obtain the derivative discontinuity without making the assumptions used in its standard derivation, offering independent support for its existence.",2013-05-17T05:18:42Z,2013-08-10T09:38:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3982v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.3982v2,"cond-mat.str-el, physics.chem-ph"
The Lambda CDM-model in quantum field theory on curved spacetime and   Dark Radiation,Thomas-Paul Hack,"In the standard model of cosmology, the universe is described by a Robertson-Walker spacetime, while its matter/energy content is modeled by a perfect fluid with three components corresponding to matter/dust, radiation and a cosmological constant. On the other hand, in particle physics matter and radiation are described in terms of quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime. We unify these seemingly different theoretical frameworks by analysing the standard model of cosmology from first principles within quantum field theory on curved spacetime: assuming that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, we specify a class of quantum states whose expectation value of the energy density is qualitatively and quantitatively of the standard perfect fluid form up to potential corrections. Qualitatively, these corrections depend on new parameters not present in the standard Lambda CDM-model and can account for e.g. the phenomenon of Dark Radiation (N_eff>3.046), having a characteristic signature which clearly deviates from other potential Dark Radiation sources such as e.g. sterile neutrinos. Quantitatively, we find that our more fundamental model can be perfectly matched to observational data, such that we arrive at a natural and fundamental extension of the Lambda CDM-model.",2013-06-13T10:58:27Z,2013-06-13T10:58:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3074v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.3074v1,"gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th"
RDCI: A novel method of cluster analysis and applications thereof in   sample molecular simulations,"Theophanes Raptis, Vasilios Raptis","A novel method, termed Reduced Dimensionality Cluster Identification, RDCI, is presented, for the identification and quantitative description of clusters formed by N objects in three dimensional space. The method consists of finding a path, as short as possible, connecting the objects, and then tracking down the size s, of a subgroup i-n, i-n+1, ..., i+n, of 2n+1 < N particles for i varying from n+1 to N-n. Clusters are located where local minima of s(i) occur whereas local maxima serve as delimiters partitioning the path in subsets containing the clusters. Minimal post-processing allows for the removal of outliers on the basis of user-defined criteria and the identification of clearly defined clusters. The advantage of the method is that it requires no predetermined input or criteria of ""clusterness"" such as number of objects or size of aggregates. Among the numerous possible applications of the method, results are herein reported, from Molecular Dynamics simulations of a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones fluids and of a model polymeric system with a gas-like substance dispersed in it. The method is shown to allow the extraction of meaningful quantitative information regarding the tendency of molecules to cluster or de-cluster and the dynamics of the clustering processes.",2013-06-14T17:25:15Z,2013-06-14T17:25:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3460v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.3460v1,"cond-mat.other, physics.comp-ph"

Hence, we provide the regions of the parameter space for which these specifications are satisfied. Given a STL specification of the target circuit to be designed and the networks of its constituent components, we propose a methodology to constrain the behaviour of each module, then identifying the subset of the parameter space in which those constraints are satisfied, providing also a measure of the robustness for the target circuit design.

Statistical mechanics of the US Supreme Court,"Edward D. Lee, Chase P.

The least structured, or maximum entropy, model that is consistent with the observed pairwise correlations among justices' votes is equivalent to an Ising spin glass. While all correlations (perhaps surprisingly) are positive, the effective pairwise interactions in the spin glass model have both signs, recovering some of our intuition that justices on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum should have a negative influence on one another. Despite the competing interactions, a strong tendency toward unanimity emerges from the model, and this agrees quantitatively with the data. The model shows that voting patterns are organized in a relatively simple ""energy landscape,"" correctly predicts the extent to which each justice is correlated with the majority, and gives us a measure of the influence that justices exert on one another.

This is often referred to as the optical inverse problem, that is nonlinear and ill-posed. The proved properties of the forward operator provide sufficient conditions to show regularized properties of approximated solutions obtained by Tikhonov-type approaches.

We refine this method using new technical machinery for random $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices that hold not just asymptotically, but for any values of $d$ and $n$. This lets us estimate how quickly the probability of containing a Hamiltonian cycle converges to 1, and it produces quantitative contiguity results between different models of random regular graphs. These results hold with $d$ held fixed or growing to infinity with $n$. As additional applications, we establish the distributional convergence of the number of Hamiltonian cycles when $d$ grows slowly to infinity, and we prove that the number of Hamiltonian cycles can be approximately computed from the graph's eigenvalues for almost all regular graphs.",2013-07-18T08:14:22Z,2015-05-22T19:40:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4858v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4858v3,"math.PR, math.CO, 60C05, 05C80, 05C45"

These matrices have a one-to-one correspondence with the adjacency matrices of lossless expander graphs. We present tail bounds on the probability that the cardinality of the set of neighbors for these graphs will be less than the expected value. The bounds are derived through the analysis of collisions in unions of sets using a {\em dyadic splitting} technique. This analysis led to the derivation of better constants that allow for quantitative theorems on existence of lossless expander graphs and hence the sparse random matrices we consider and also quantitative compressed sensing sampling theorems when using sparse non mean-zero measurement matrices.,2013-07-24T16:12:29Z,2013-07-24T16:12:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6477v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.6477v1,"cs.IT, math.IT"
Fluctuations in lipid bilayers: Are they understood?,Friederike Schmid,"We review recent computer simulation studies of undulating lipid bilayers. Theoretical interpretations of such fluctuating membranes are most commonly based on generalized Helfrich-type elastic models, with additional contributions of local ""protrusions"" and/or density fluctuations. Such models provide an excellent basis for describing the fluctuations of tensionless bilayers in the fluid phase at a quantitative level.   However, this description is found to fail for membranes in the gel phase and for membranes subject to high tensions. The fluctuations of tilted gel membranes show a signature of the modulated ripple structure, which is a nearby phase observed in the pretransition regime between the fluid and tilted gel state. This complicates a quantitative analysis on mesoscopic length scales. In the case of fluid membranes under tension, the large-wavelength fluctuation modes are found to be significantly softer than predicted by theory.   In the latter context, we also address the general problem of the relation between frame tension and the fluctuation tension, which has been discussed somewhat controversially in recent years. Simulations of very simple model membranes with fixed area show that the fluctuations should be controlled by the frame tension, and not by the internal tension.",2013-08-31T11:26:43Z,2013-08-31T11:26:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0097v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0097v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft"
Quantitative modeling of degree-degree correlation in complex networks,"Alfonso Niño, Camelia Muñoz-Caro","This paper presents an approach to the modeling of degree-degree correlation in complex networks. Thus, a simple function, \Delta(k', k), describing specific degree-to- degree correlations is considered. The function is well suited to graphically depict assortative and disassortative variations within networks. To quantify degree correlation variations, the joint probability distribution between nodes with arbitrary degrees, P(k', k), is used. Introduction of the end-degree probability function as a basic variable allows using group theory to derive mathematical models for P(k', k). In this form, an expression, representing a family of seven models, is constructed with the needed normalization conditions. Applied to \Delta(k', k), this expression predicts a nonuniform distribution of degree correlation in networks, organized in two assortative and two disassortative zones. This structure is actually observed in a set of four modeled, technological, social, and biological networks. A regression study performed on 15 actual networks shows that the model describes quantitatively degree-degree correlation variations.",2013-09-06T14:52:36Z,2013-09-09T10:53:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1662v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1662v2,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech"

In the context of arbitrary measurement matrices, we derive a sufficient condition for convergence of IHT to a fixed point and a necessary condition for the existence of fixed points. These conditions allow us to perform a sparse signal recovery analysis in the deterministic noiseless case by implying that the original sparse signal is the unique fixed point and limit point of IHT, and in the case of Gaussian measurement matrices and noise by generating a bound on the approximation error of the IHT limit as a multiple of the noise level. By generalizing the notion of fixed points, we extend our analysis to the variable stepsize Normalised IHT (N-IHT) (Blumensath and Davies, 2010). For both stepsize schemes, we obtain lower bounds on asymptotic phase transitions in a proportional-dimensional framework, quantifying the sparsity/undersampling trade-off for which recovery is guaranteed.

However, the HH model does not capture a number of biophysical behaviors associated with action potentials or propagating nerve impulses. Physical mechanisms underlying these processes, such as reversible heat transfer and axonal swelling have been separately investigated and compartmentally modeled to indicate the nervous system is not purely electrical or biochemical. Rather, mechanical forces and principles of thermodynamics also govern neuronal excitability and signaling. To advance our understanding of neural function and dysfunction, compartmentalized analyses of electrical, chemical, and mechanical processes need to revaluated and integrated into more comprehensive theories. The present quantitative perspective is intended to broaden the awareness of known biophysical phenomena, which are often overlooked in neuroscience.

Prefix and plain Kolmogorov complexity characterizations of   2-randomness: simple proofs,Bruno Bauwens,"Joseph Miller [16] and independently Andre Nies, Frank Stephan and Sebastiaan Terwijn [18] gave a complexity characterization of 2-random sequences in terms of plain Kolmogorov complexity C: they are sequences that have infinitely many initial segments with O(1)-maximal plain complexity (among the strings of the same length). Later Miller [17] showed that prefix complexity K can also be used in a similar way: a sequence is 2-random if and only if it has infinitely many initial segments with O(1)-maximal prefix complexity (which is n + K (n) for strings of length n). The known proofs of these results are quite involved; in this paper we provide simple direct proofs for both of them.   In [16] Miller also gave a quantitative version of the first result: the 0'-randomness deficiency of a sequence {\omega} equals lim inf [n - C ({\omega}1 . . . {\omega}n)] + O(1). (Our simplified proof can also be used to prove this.)

This means that the dynamics of the subnetwork will depend not only on its present state, but also its past. We use projection techniques to get explicit expressions for the memory functions that encode such memory effects, for generic protein interaction networks involving binary and unary reactions such as complex formation and phosphorylation, respectively. Remarkably, in the limit of low intrinsic copy-number noise such expressions can be obtained even for nonlinear dependences on the past. We illustrate the method with examples from a protein interaction network around epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is relevant to cancer signalling. These examples demonstrate that inclusion of memory terms is not only important conceptually but also leads to substantially higher quantitative accuracy in the predicted subnetwork dynamics.",2014-02-04T14:42:51Z,2014-06-16T12:44:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0749v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.0749v2,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.MN"

Quantitative photoacoustic tomography with piecewise constant material   parameters,"Wolf Naetar, Otmar Scherzer","The goal of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is to determine optical and acoustical material properties from initial pressure maps as obtained, for instance, from photoacoustic imaging. The most relevant parameters are absorption, diffusion and Grueneisen coefficients, all of which can be heterogeneous. Recent work by Bal and Ren shows that in general, unique reconstruction of all three parameters is impossible, even if multiple measurements of the initial pressure (corresponding to different laser excitation directions at a single wavelength) are available.   Here, we propose a restriction to piecewise constant material parameters. We show that in the diffusion approximation of light transfer, piecewise constant absorption, diffusion and Gr\""uneisen coefficients can be recovered uniquely from photoacoustic measurements at a single wavelength.

Theory and Application of Shapelets to the Analysis of Surface   Self-assembly Imaging,"Robert Suderman, Daniel Lizotte, Nasser Mohieddin Abukhdeir","A method for quantitative analysis of local pattern strength and defects in surface self-assembly imaging is presented and applied to images of stripe and hexagonal ordered domains. The presented method uses ""shapelet"" functions which were originally developed for quantitative analysis of images of galaxies ($\propto 10^{20}\mathrm{m}$). In this work, they are used instead to quantify the presence of translational order in surface self-assembled films ($\propto 10^{-9}\mathrm{m}$) through reformulation into ""steerable"" filters. The resulting method is both computationally efficient (with respect to the number of filter evaluations), robust to variation in pattern feature shape, and, unlike previous approaches, is applicable to a wide variety of pattern types.

Entropy of leukemia on multidimensional morphological and molecular   landscapes,Jose M. G. Vilar,"Leukemia epitomizes the class of highly complex diseases that new technologies aim to tackle by using large sets of single-cell level information. Achieving such goal depends critically not only on experimental techniques but also on approaches to interpret the data. A most pressing issue is to identify the salient quantitative features of the disease from the resulting massive amounts of information. Here, I show that the entropies of cell-population distributions on specific multidimensional molecular and morphological landscapes provide a set of measures for the precise characterization of normal and pathological states, such as those corresponding to healthy individuals and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. I provide a systematic procedure to identify the specific landscapes and illustrate how, applied to cell samples from peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates, this characterization accurately diagnoses AML from just flow cytometry data. The methodology can generally be applied to other types of cell-populations and establishes a straightforward link between the traditional statistical thermodynamics methodology and biomedical applications.",2014-05-30T13:26:11Z,2014-05-30T13:26:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7856v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7856v1,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.med-ph"

Here, we study the spatio-temporal patterns arising from the cyclic competition between three species in two dimensions. Inspired by recent experiments, we consider a generic metapopulation model comprising ""rock-paper-scissors"" interactions via dominance removal and replacement, reproduction, mutations, pair-exchange and hopping of individuals. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we obtain the model's phase diagram near its Hopf bifurcation and quantitatively characterize the properties of the spiraling patterns arising in each phase. The phases characterizing the cyclic competition away far from the Hopf bifurcation (at low mutation rate) are also investigated. Our analytical approach relies on the careful analysis of the properties of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation derived through a controlled (perturbative) multiscale expansion around the model's Hopf bifurcation.

Group Minds and the Case of Wikipedia,Simon DeDeo,"Group-level cognitive states are widely observed in human social systems, but their discussion is often ruled out a priori in quantitative approaches. In this paper, we show how reference to the irreducible mental states and psychological dynamics of a group is necessary to make sense of large scale social phenomena. We introduce the problem of mental boundaries by reference to a classic problem in the evolution of cooperation. We then provide an explicit quantitative example drawn from ongoing work on cooperation and conflict among Wikipedia editors, showing how some, but not all, effects of individual experience persist in the aggregate. We show the limitations of methodological individualism, and the substantial benefits that come from being able to refer to collective intentions, and attributions of cognitive states of the form ""what the group believes"" and ""what the group values"".",2014-07-08T18:46:21Z,2014-10-13T21:34:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2210v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2210v2,"q-bio.NC, cs.GT, cs.SI, physics.soc-ph, q-bio.PE"
Universality in stochastic exponential growth,"Srividya Iyer-Biswas, Gavin E. Crooks, Norbert F. Scherer, Aaron R. Dinner","Recent imaging data for single bacterial cells reveal that their mean sizes grow exponentially in time and that their size distributions collapse to a single curve when rescaled by their means. An analogous result holds for the division-time distributions. A model is needed to delineate the minimal requirements for these scaling behaviors. We formulate a microscopic theory of stochastic exponential growth as a Master Equation that accounts for these observations, in contrast to existing quantitative models of stochastic exponential growth (e.g., the Black-Scholes equation or geometric Brownian motion). Our model, the stochastic Hinshelwood cycle (SHC), is an autocatalytic reaction cycle in which each molecular species catalyzes the production of the next. By finding exact analytical solutions to the SHC and the corresponding first passage time problem, we uncover universal signatures of fluctuations in exponential growth and division. The model makes minimal assumptions, and we describe how more complex reaction networks can reduce to such a cycle. We thus expect similar scalings to be discovered in stochastic processes resulting in exponential growth that appear in diverse contexts such as cosmology, finance, technology, and population growth.",2014-07-10T20:00:34Z,2014-07-10T20:00:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2945v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2945v1,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.soft, q-bio.CB, q-bio.QM"
Interference Visibility as a Witness of Entanglement and Quantum   Correlation,"Lin Zhang, Arun Kumar Pati, Junde Wu","In quantum information and communication one looks for the non-classical features like interference and quantum correlations to harness the true power of composite systems. We show how the concept akin to interference is, in fact, intertwined in a quantitative manner to entanglement and quantum correlation. In particular, we prove that the difference in the squared visibility for a density operator before and after a complete measurement, averaged over all unitary evolutions, is directly related to the quantum correlation measure based on the measurement disturbance. For pure and mixed bipartite states the unitary average of the squared visibility is related to entanglement measure. This may constitute direct detection of entanglement and quantum correlations with quantum interference setups. Furthermore, we prove that for a fixed purity of the subsystem state, there is a complementarity relation between the linear entanglement of formation and the measurement disturbance. This brings out a quantitative difference between two kinds of quantum correlations.",2014-07-24T05:51:12Z,2014-10-30T10:21:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6460v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.6460v2,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP"

Exact distributions for stochastic gene expression models with bursting   and feedback,"Niraj Kumar, Thierry Platini, Rahul V.

Recent experiments indicate that bursting and feedback mechanisms play important roles in controlling noise in gene expression and phenotypic variation. A quantitative understanding of the impact of these factors requires analysis of the corresponding stochastic models. However, for stochastic models of gene expression with feedback and bursting, exact analytical results for protein distributions have not been obtained so far. Here, we analyze a model of gene expression with bursting and feedback regulation and obtain exact results for the corresponding protein steady-state distribution. The results obtained provide new insights into the role of bursting and feedback in noise regulation and optimization. Furthermore, for a specific choice of parameters, the system studied maps on to a two-state biochemical switch driven by a bursty input noise source. The analytical results derived thus provide quantitative insights into diverse cellular processes involving noise in gene expression and biochemical switching.",2014-09-11T16:45:34Z,2014-11-26T15:31:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3499v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3499v2,"q-bio.MN, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph"

Odor Landscapes in Turbulent Environments,"Antonio Celani, Emmanuel Villermaux, Massimo Vergassola","The olfactory system of male moths is exquisitely sensitive to pheromones emitted by females and transported in the environment by atmospheric turbulence. Moths respond to minute amounts of pheromones and their behavior is sensitive to the fine-scale structure of turbulent plumes where pheromone concentration is detectible. The signal of pheromone whiffs is qualitatively known to be intermittent, yet quantitative characterization of its statistical properties is lacking. This challenging fluid dynamics problem is also relevant for entomology, neurobiology and the technological design of olfactory stimulators aimed at reproducing physiological odor signals in well-controlled laboratory conditions. Here, we develop a Lagrangian approach to the transport of pheromones by turbulent flows and exploit it to predict the statistics of odor detection during olfactory searches. The theory yields explicit probability distributions for the intensity and the duration of pheromone detections, as well as their spacing in time. Predictions are favorably tested by using numerical simulations, laboratory experiments and field data for the atmospheric surface layer. The resulting signal of odor detections lends to implementation with state-of-the-art technologies and quantifies the amount and the type of information that male moths can exploit during olfactory searches.",2014-11-13T11:33:41Z,2014-11-13T11:33:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3507v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.3507v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.flu-dyn"

Approximated wavelet-based versions of EGG signals were calculated using Pollen parameterization of 6-tap wavelet filters and wavelet compression techniques.

Inherent directionality explains the lack of feedback loops in empirical   networks,"Virginia Domínguez-García, Simone Pigolotti, Miguel A.

Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a simple probabilistic model in which a free parameter $\gamma$ controls the degree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also feedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and feedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio- technological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical networks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network randomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively reproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter $\gamma$. Moreover, the fitted value of $\gamma$ correlates quite well with another direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a novel algorithm. We conclude that the existence of an inherent network directionality provides a parsimonious quantitative explanation for the observed lack of feedback loops in empirical networks.",2015-02-12T11:27:15Z,2015-02-12T11:27:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03816v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03816v1,"q-bio.MN, physics.soc-ph"

The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and text-mining tools we analyse the musical properties of ~17,000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic ""revolutions"" around 1964, 1983 and 1991.

To identify the mechanical forces at play, we constructed a detailed finite-element model of the hair bundle. Based on data from the hair bundle of the bullfrog's sacculus, this model treats the interaction of stereocilia both with the surrounding liquid and with the liquid in the narrow gaps between the individual stereocilia. The investigation revealed that grouping stereocilia in a bundle dramatically reduces the total drag. During hair-bundle deflections, the tip links potentially induce drag by causing small but very dissipative relative motions between stereocilia; this effect is offset by the horizontal top connectors that restrain such relative movements at low frequencies. For higher frequencies the coupling liquid is sufficient to assure that the hair bundle moves as a unit with a low total drag. This work reveals the mechanical characteristics originating from hair-bundle morphology and shows quantitatively how a hair bundle is adapted for sensitive mechanotransduction.",2015-05-14T12:40:04Z,2015-05-14T12:40:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03705v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03705v1,"q-bio.SC, physics.bio-ph, physics.comp-ph, physics.flu-dyn, q-bio.QM"
A read-filtering algorithm for high-throughput marker-gene studies that   greatly improves OTU accuracy,"Fernando Puente-Sánchez, Jacobo Aguirre, Víctor Parro","Adequate read filtering is critical when processing high-throughput data in marker-gene-based studies. Sequencing errors can cause the mis-clustering of otherwise similar reads, artificially increasing the number of retrieved Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and therefore leading to the overestimation of microbial diversity. Sequencing errors will also result in OTUs that are not accurate reconstructions of the original biological sequences. Herein we present a novel and sensitive sequence filtering algorithm that minimizes both problems by calculating the exact error-probability distribution of a sequence from its quality scores. In order to validate our method, we quality-filtered thirty-seven publicly available datasets obtained by sequencing mock and environmental microbial communities with the Roche 454, Illumina MiSeq and IonTorrent PGM platforms, and compared our results to those obtained with previous approaches such as the ones included in mothur, QIIME and UPARSE. Our algorithm retained substantially more reads than its predecessors, while resulting in fewer and more accurate OTUs. This improved sensitiveness produced more faithful representations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the true microbial diversity present in the studied samples. Furthermore, the method introduced in this work is computationally inexpensive and can be readily applied in conjunction with any existent analysis pipeline.",2015-06-01T11:44:19Z,2015-06-01T11:44:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00453v1,"q-bio.QM, q-bio.GN, 92D20"
A Jump Distance-based Bayesian analysis method to unveil fine single   molecule transport features,Sylvain Tollis,"Single-molecule tracking (SMT) methods are under considerable expansion in many fields of cell biology, as the dynamics of cellular components in biological mechanisms becomes increasingly relevant. Despite the development of SMT technologies, it is still difficult to reconcile a sparse signal at all times (required to distinguish single molecules) with long individual trajectories, within confined regions of the cell and given experimental limitations. This strongly reduces the performance of current data analysis methods in extracting meaningful transport features from single molecules trajectories. In this work, we develop and implement a new mathematical analysis method of SMT data, which takes advantage of the large number of (short) trajectories that are typically obtained with cellular systems in vivo. The method is based on the fitting of the jump distance distribution, e.g. the distribution that represents how far molecules travel in a set time interval; it uses a Bayesian approach to compare plausible molecule motion models and extract both qualitative and quantitative information. Finally, the method is tested on in silico trajectories simulated using Monte Carlo algorithms, and ranges of parameters for which the method yields accurate results are determined.",2015-06-03T03:40:44Z,2015-06-05T04:09:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01112v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01112v2,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph"

"A Quantitative Test of the No-Hair Theorem with Sgr A* using stars,   pulsars, and the Event Horizon Telescope","Dimitrios Psaltis, Norbert Wex, Michael Kramer","The black hole in the center of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, has the largest mass-to-distance ratio among all known black holes in the Universe. This property makes Sgr A* the optimal target for testing the gravitational no-hair theorem. In the near future, major developments in instrumentation will provide the tools for high-precision studies of its spacetime via observations of relativistic effects in stellar orbits, in the timing of pulsars, and in horizon-scale images of its accretion flow. We explore here the prospect of measuring the properties of the black-hole spacetime using all these three types of observations. We show that the correlated uncertainties in the measurements of the black-hole spin and quadrupole moment using the orbits of stars and pulsars are nearly orthogonal to those obtained from measuring the shape and size of the shadow the black hole casts on the surrounding emission. Combining these three types of observations will, therefore, allow us to assess and quantify systematic biases and uncertainties in each measurement and lead to a highly accurate, quantitative test of the gravitational no-hair theorem.",2015-10-01T20:04:49Z,2015-10-01T20:04:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00394v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.00394v1,"astro-ph.HE, gr-qc"

Here we develop a novel inference scheme for mutational landscapes, which is based on the statistical analysis of large alignments of homologs of the protein of interest. Our method is able to capture epistatic couplings between residues, and therefore to assess the dependence of mutational effects on the sequence context where they appear. Compared to recent large-scale mutagenesis data of the beta-lactamase TEM-1, a protein providing resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics, our method leads to an increase of about 40% in explicative power as compared to approaches neglecting epistasis.

Our experiments show that swimming algae form an aggregate around the axis of rotation, whose intensity increases with the rotation speed. We explain this phenomenon by the centripetal orientation of the swimming direction towards the axis of rotation. This centripetal focusing is contrasted by diffusive fluxes due to stochastic reorientation of the cells. The competition of the two effects lead to a stationary distribution, which we analytically derive from a refined mathematical model of gyrotactic swimmers.

Species dispersal is acknowledged as a key factor for the design and impacts of closed areas. A series of agent based models using random diffusion to model fish dispersal were run before and after habitat protection. All results were normalised without the protected habitat in each scenario to detect the relative difference after closing an area, all else being equal. Results show that landings of species with short dispersal ranges will take longer to reach the levels of pre Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) establishment than landings of species with long dispersal ranges. Further the establishment of an MPA generates a higher relative population source within the MPA for species with low dispersal abilities than for species with high dispersal abilities.

It is fair to assume that during their evolution they developed particular features to overcome problems and to exploit possibilities from environment. In this paper we introduce various quantitative measures based on recent advancements in complex network theory that allow to measure the effective similarities of various species. By using this approach on the similarity in fruit-typology ecological traits we obtain a clear plant classification in a way similar to traditional taxonomic classification. This result is not trivial, since a similar analysis done on the basis of diaspore morphological properties do not provide any clear parameter to classify plants species. Complex network theory can then be used in order to determine which feature amongst many can be used to distinguish scope and possibly evolution of plants.

As a consequence, we show how the asymptotic dependence on the threshold level $u$ is fully degenerate, i.e., the Euler-Poincar\'{e} Characteristic converges to a single random variable times a deterministic function of the threshold.

An active efficient coding model of the optokinetic nystagmus,"Chong Zhang, Jochen Triesch, Bertram E. Shi","Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is an involuntary eye movement responsible for stabilizing retinal images in the presence of relative motion between an observer and the environment. Fully understanding the development of optokinetic nystagmus requires a neurally plausible computational model that accounts for the neural development and the behavior. To date, work in this area has been limited. We propose a neurally plausible framework for the joint development of disparity and motion tuning in the visual cortex, the optokinetic and vergence eye movements. This framework models the joint emergence of both perception and behavior, and accounts for the importance of the development of normal vergence control and binocular vision in achieving normal monocular OKN (mOKN) behaviors. Because the model includes behavior, we can simulate the same perturbations as performed in past experiments, such as artificially induced strabismus. The proposed model agrees both qualitatively and quantitatively with a number of findings from the literature on both binocular vision as well as the optokinetic reflex. Finally, our model also makes quantitative predictions about the OKN behavior using the same methods used to characterize the OKN in the experimental literature.",2016-06-21T07:01:18Z,2016-10-11T07:07:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06443v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06443v3,"q-bio.NC, cs.NE"

Although the methods are limited by the accuracy in localizing individual flourophores, this point-wise accuracy has so far only been estimated by theoretical best case approximations, disregarding for example motional blur, out of focus broadening of the point spread function and time varying changes in the fluorescence background. Here, we show that pointwise localization uncertainty can be accurately estimated directly from imaging data using a Laplace approximation constrained by simple mircoscope properties. We further demonstrate that the estimated localization uncertainty can be used to improve downstream quantitative analysis, such as estimation of diffusion constants and detection of changes in molecular motion patterns. Most importantly, the accuracy of actual point localizations in live cell super-resolution microscopy can be improved beyond the information theoretic lower bound for localization errors in individual images, by modeling the fluorophores' movement and accounting for their point-wise localization uncertainty.",2016-07-15T22:36:16Z,2016-07-15T22:36:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04675v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04675v1,"physics.bio-ph, physics.data-an, physics.optics, q-bio.QM"
Flagellar flows around bacterial swarms,"Justas Dauparas, Eric Lauga","Flagellated bacteria on nutrient-rich substrates can differentiate into a swarming state and move in dense swarms across surfaces. A recent experiment measured the flow in the fluid around an Escherichia coli swarm (Wu, Hosu and Berg, 2011 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108 4147). A systematic chiral flow was observed in the clockwise direction (when viewed from above) ahead of the swarm with flow speeds of about $10~\mu$m/s, about 3 times greater than the radial velocity at the edge of the swarm. The working hypothesis is that this flow is due to the action of cells stalled at the edge of a colony that extend their flagellar filaments outwards, moving fluid over the virgin agar. In this work we quantitatively test his hypothesis. We first build an analytical model of the flow induced by a single flagellum in a thin film and then use the model, and its extension to multiple flagella, to compare with experimental measurements. The results we obtain are in agreement with the flagellar hypothesis. The model provides further quantitative insight into the flagella orientations and their spatial distributions as well as the tangential speed profile. In particular, the model suggests that flagella are on average pointing radially out of the swarm and are not wrapped tangentially.",2016-07-27T10:42:25Z,2016-07-27T10:42:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08029v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08029v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft, physics.flu-dyn"
Growing complex network of citations of scientific papers --   measurements and modeling,"M. Golosovsky, S. Solomon","To quantify the mechanism of a complex network growth we focus on the network of citations of scientific papers and use a combination of the theoretical and experimental tools to uncover microscopic details of this network growth. Namely, we develop a stochastic model of citation dynamics based on copying/redirection/triadic closure mechanism. In a complementary and coherent way, the model accounts both for statistics of references of scientific papers and for their citation dynamics. Originating in empirical measurements, the model is cast in such a way that it can be verified quantitatively in every aspect. Such verification is performed by measuring citation dynamics of Physics papers. The measurements revealed nonlinear citation dynamics, the nonlinearity being intricately related to network topology. The nonlinearity has far-reaching consequences including non-stationary citation distributions, diverging citation trajectory of similar papers, runaways or ""immortal papers"" with infinite citation lifetime etc. Thus, our most important finding is nonlinearity in complex network growth. In a more specific context, our results can be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics of individual papers and of the journal impact factor.",2016-07-28T09:20:42Z,2016-07-28T09:20:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08370v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08370v1,"cs.DL, physics.data-an, physics.soc-ph"

Pulsatile lipid vesicles under osmotic stress,"Morgan Chabanon, James C. S. Ho, Bo Liedberg, Atul N.

Previously, in [Oglecka et al. 2014], we reported that cell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exposed to hypotonic media, respond to the osmotic assault by undergoing a cyclical sequence of swelling and bursting events, coupled to the membrane's compositional degrees of freedom. Here, we seek to deepen our quantitative understanding of the essential pulsatile behavior of GUVs under hypotonic conditions, by advancing a comprehensive theoretical model for vesicle dynamics. The model quantitatively captures our experimentally measured swell-burst parameters for single-component GUVs, and reveals that thermal fluctuations enable rate dependent pore nucleation, driving the dynamics of the swell-burst cycles. We further identify new scaling relationships between the pulsatile dynamics and GUV properties. Our findings provide a fundamental framework that has the potential to guide future investigations on the non-equilibrium dynamics of vesicles under osmotic stress.",2016-08-18T18:28:27Z,2017-05-02T07:16:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05364v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05364v2,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.soft, q-bio.SC"

Following the usual approach, we first consider the analogous problem of Fisher information dissipation, and then integrate along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup to obtain an entropic inequality. In a departure from previous work, we appeal to a result by Desvillettes and Villani on entropy production associated to the Landau equation. This obviates strong regularity assumptions, such as presence of a spectral gap and log-concavity of densities, but comes at the expense of radial symmetry. As an application, we give a quantitative estimate of the deficit in the Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequality for radially symmetric functions.",2016-08-18T21:06:30Z,2016-11-03T16:45:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05430v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05430v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, math.PR"
Hidden Structures of Information Transport Underlying Spiral Wave   Dynamics,"Hiroshi Ashikaga, Ryan G. James","A spiral wave is a macroscopic dynamic of excitable media that plays an important role in several distinct systems, including the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, seizures in the brain, and lethal arrhythmia in the heart. Because spiral wave dynamics can exhibit a wide spectrum of behaviors, its precise quantification can be challenging. Here we present a hybrid geometric and information-theoretic approach to quantifying spiral wave dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to numerical simulations of a two-dimensional excitable medium with different numbers and spatial patterns of spiral waves. We show that, by defining information flow over the excitable medium, hidden coherent structures emerge that effectively quantify the information transport underlying spiral wave dynamics. Most importantly, we find that some coherent structures become more clearly defined over a longer observation period. These findings validate our approach to quantitatively characterize spiral wave dynamics by focusing on information transport. Our approach is computationally efficient and is applicable to many excitable media of interest in distinct physical, chemical and biological systems. Our approach could ultimately contribute to an improved therapy of clinical conditions such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmia by identifying potential targets of interventional therapies.",2016-08-11T15:34:56Z,2016-08-11T15:34:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06816v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06816v1,"nlin.PS, math.DS, q-bio.QM"

The main use of $GA_1$ is for designing so-called quantitative structure-activity relations and quantitative structure-property relations.

Varieties of Metric and Quantitative Algebras,Wataru Hino,"Metric algebras are metric variants of $\Sigma$-algebras. They are first introduced in the field of universal algebra to deal with algebras equipped with metric structures such as normed vector spaces. Recently a similar notion of quantitative algebra is used in computer science to formulate computational effects of probabilistic programs. In this paper we show that varieties of metric algebras (classes defined by a set of metric equations) are exactly classes closed under (metric versions of) subalgebras, products and quotients. This result implies the class of normed vector spaces cannot be defined by metric equations, differently from the classical case where the class of vector spaces is equational. This phenomenon suggests that metric equations are not a very natural class of formulas since they cannot express such a typical class of metric algebras. Therefore we need a broader class of formulas to acquire an appropriate metric counterpart of the classical variety theory.",2016-12-19T06:10:43Z,2016-12-19T06:10:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06054v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06054v1,"cs.LO, math.LO"

The results are in quantitative agreement with predictions made on the basis of the dispersive Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian. We study this system with the goal of realizing a hybrid between superconducting circuits and Rydberg atoms. We measure maximal collective coupling strengths of 1 MHz, corresponding to 3*10^3 Rydberg atoms coupled to the cavity.

Identification of Unmodeled Objects from Symbolic Descriptions,"Andrea Baisero, Stefan Otte, Peter Englert, Marc Toussaint","Successful human-robot cooperation hinges on each agent's ability to process and exchange information about the shared environment and the task at hand. Human communication is primarily based on symbolic abstractions of object properties, rather than precise quantitative measures. A comprehensive robotic framework thus requires an integrated communication module which is able to establish a link and convert between perceptual and abstract information.   The ability to interpret composite symbolic descriptions enables an autonomous agent to a) operate in unstructured and cluttered environments, in tasks which involve unmodeled or never seen before objects; and b) exploit the aggregation of multiple symbolic properties as an instance of ensemble learning, to improve identification performance even when the individual predicates encode generic information or are imprecisely grounded.   We propose a discriminative probabilistic model which interprets symbolic descriptions to identify the referent object contextually w.r.t.\ the structure of the environment and other objects.

Quantum Probabilities as Behavioral Probabilities,"V. I. Yukalov, D. Sornette","We demonstrate that behavioral probabilities of human decision makers share many common features with quantum probabilities. This does not imply that humans are some quantum objects, but just shows that the mathematics of quantum theory is applicable to the description of human decision making. The applicability of quantum rules for describing decision making is connected with the nontrivial process of making decisions in the case of composite prospects under uncertainty. Such a process involves deliberations of a decision maker when making a choice. In addition to the evaluation of the utilities of considered prospects, real decision makers also appreciate their respective attractiveness. Therefore, human choice is not based solely on the utility of prospects, but includes the necessity of resolving the utility-attraction duality. In order to justify that human consciousness really functions similarly to the rules of quantum theory, we develop an approach defining human behavioral probabilities as the probabilities determined by quantum rules. We show that quantum behavioral probabilities of humans not merely explain qualitatively how human decisions are made, but they predict quantitative values of the behavioral probabilities.

Coexisting complexes arising from self- or hetero-associations that can be distinguished in SV allow measurement of their stoichiometry, affinity, and cooperativity. However, assemblies that are short-lived on the time-scale of sedimentation (t1/2 < 100 sec) will exhibit an as of yet unexplored pattern of sedimentation boundaries governed by coupled co-migration of the entire system.

In this paper, VOCs spontaneously emitted by 109 plant species (belonging to 56 different families) have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed in order to classify plants species. By using bipartite networks methodology, based on recent advancements in Complex Network Theory, and through the application of complementary classical and advanced community detection algorithms, the possibility to classify species according to chemical classes such as terpenes and sulfur compounds is suggested. This indicates complex network analysis as an advantageous methodology to uncover plants relationships also related to the way they react to the environment where they evolve and adapt.",2017-04-26T11:25:30Z,2017-04-26T11:25:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08062v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08062v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.data-an"
Learning the structure of Bayesian Networks: A quantitative assessment   of the effect of different algorithmic schemes,"Stefano Beretta, Mauro Castelli, Ivo Goncalves, Roberto Henriques, Daniele Ramazzotti","One of the most challenging tasks when adopting Bayesian Networks (BNs) is the one of learning their structure from data. This task is complicated by the huge search space of possible solutions, and by the fact that the problem is NP-hard. Hence, full enumeration of all the possible solutions is not always feasible and approximations are often required. However, to the best of our knowledge, a quantitative analysis of the performance and characteristics of the different heuristics to solve this problem has never been done before.   For this reason, in this work, we provide a detailed comparison of many different state-of-the-arts methods for structural learning on simulated data considering both BNs with discrete and continuous variables, and with different rates of noise in the data. In particular, we investigate the performance of different widespread scores and algorithmic approaches proposed for the inference and the statistical pitfalls within them.",2017-04-27T17:40:22Z,2018-08-03T20:16:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08676v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08676v2,"cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML"
Exploring the onset of collective motion in self-organised trails of   social organisms,"E. Brigatti, A. Hernández","We investigate the emergence of self-organised trails between two specific target areas in collective motion of social organisms by means of an agent-based model. We present numerical evidences that an increase in the efficiency of navigation in dependence of the colony size, exists. Moreover, the shift, from the diffusive to the directed motion can be quantitatively characterised, identifying and measuring a well defined crossover point. This point corresponds to the minimal number of individuals necessary for the onset of collective cooperation. Finally, by means of a finite-size scaling analysis, we describe its scaling behavior as a function of the environment size. This last result can be of particular interest for interpreting empirical observations or for the design of artificial swarms.",2017-05-11T13:45:12Z,2018-02-24T11:23:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04182v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04182v2,"nlin.AO, q-bio.QM"
On the trade-off between labels and weights in quantitative bisimulation,Marco Peressotti,"Reductions for transition systems have been recently introduced as a uniform and principled method for comparing the expressiveness of system models with respect to a range of properties, especially bisimulations. In this paper we study the expressiveness (w.r.t. bisimulations) of models for quantitative computations such as weighted labelled transition systems (WLTSs), uniform labelled transition systems (ULTraSs), and state-to-function transition systems (FuTSs). We prove that there is a trade-off between labels and weights: at one extreme lays the class of (unlabelled) weighted transition systems where information is presented using weights only; at the other lays the class of labelled transition systems (LTSs) where information is shifted on labels. These categories of systems cannot be further reduced in any significant way and subsume all the aforementioned models.",2017-05-18T07:01:42Z,2017-05-18T07:01:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06439v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06439v1,"cs.LO, F.1.2; F.3.2"
Quantitative stochastic homogenization and regularity theory of   parabolic equations,"Scott Armstrong, Alexandre Bordas, Jean-Christophe Mourrat","We develop a quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for linear, uniformly parabolic equations with coefficients depending on space and time. Inspired by recent works in the elliptic setting, our analysis is focused on certain subadditive quantities derived from a variational interpretation of parabolic equations. These subadditive quantities are intimately connected to spatial averages of the fluxes and gradients of solutions. We implement a renormalization-type scheme to obtain an algebraic rate for their convergence, which is essentially a quantification of the weak convergence of the gradients and fluxes of solutions to their homogenized limits. As a consequence, we obtain estimates of the homogenization error for the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem which are optimal in stochastic integrability. We also develop a higher regularity theory for solutions of the heterogeneous equation, including a uniform $C^{0,1}$-type estimate and a Liouville theorem of every finite order.",2017-05-22T11:26:28Z,2018-04-12T15:08:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07672v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07672v3,"math.AP, math.PR, 35B27, 60K37"
Why we live in hierarchies: a quantitative treatise,"Anna Zafeiris, Tamás Vicsek","This book is concerned with the various aspects of hierarchical collective behaviour which is manifested by most complex systems in nature. From the many of the possible topics, we plan to present a selection of those that we think are useful from the point of shedding light from very different directions onto our quite general subject. Our intention is to both present the essential contributions by the existing approaches as well as go significantly beyond the results obtained by traditional methods by applying a more quantitative approach then the common ones (there are many books on qualitative interpretations). In addition to considering hierarchy in systems made of similar kinds of units, we shall concentrate on problems involving either dominance relations or the process of collective decision-making from various viewpoints.",2017-07-06T12:18:31Z,2017-07-06T12:18:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01744v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01744v1,"physics.soc-ph, nlin.AO, physics.bio-ph"
Transport of Intensity Equation Microscopy for Dynamic Microtubules,Q. Tyrell Davis,"Microtubules (MTs) are filamentous protein polymers roughly 25 nm in diameter. Ubiquitous in eukaryotes, MTs are well known for their structural role but also act as actuators, sensors, and, in association with other proteins, checkpoint regulators. The thin diameter and transparency of microtubules classifies them as sub-resolution phase objects, with concomitant imaging challenges. Label-free methods for imaging microtubules are preferred when long exposure times would lead to phototoxicity in fluorescence, or for retaining more native structure and activity.   This method approaches quantitative phase imaging of MTs as an inverse problem based on the Transport of Intensity Equation. In a co-registered comparison of MT signal-to-background-noise ratio, TIE Microscopy of MTs shows an improvement of more than three times that of video-enhanced bright field imaging.   This method avoids the anisotropy caused by prisms used in differential interference contrast and takes only two defocused images as input. Unlike other label-free techniques for imaging microtubules, in TIE microscopy background removal is a natural consequence of taking the difference of two defocused images, so the need to frequently update a background image is eliminated.",2017-07-13T14:19:40Z,2017-07-31T14:36:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04139v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04139v2,"physics.optics, q-bio.QM"
Quantitative stability of the free boundary in the obstacle problem,"Sylvia Serfaty, Joaquim Serra","We prove some detailed quantitative stability results for the contact set and the solution of the classical obstacle problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \ge 2$) under perturbations of the obstacle function, which is also equivalent to studying the variation of the equilibrium measure in classical potential theory under a perturbation of the external field.   To do so, working in the setting of the whole space, we examine the evolution of the free boundary $\Gamma^t$ corresponding to the boundary of the contact set for a family of obstacle functions $h^t$. Assuming that $h=h^t (x) = h(t,x)$ is $C^{k+1,\alpha}$ in $[-1,1]\times \mathbb{R}^n$ and that the initial free boundary $\Gamma^0$ is regular, we prove that $\Gamma^t$ is twice differentiable in $t$ in a small neighborhood of $t=0$. Moreover, we show that the ""normal velocity"" and the ""normal acceleration"" of $\Gamma^t$ are respectively $C^{k-1,\alpha}$ and $C^{k-2,\alpha}$ scalar fields on $\Gamma^t$. This is accomplished by deriving equations for these velocity and acceleration and studying the regularity of their solutions via single and double layers estimates from potential theory.",2017-08-04T13:31:53Z,2017-08-04T13:31:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01490v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01490v1,"math.AP, math-ph, math.CV, math.MP, 35R35, 31B35, 49K99"
Structured illumination microscopy for dual-modality 3D sub-diffraction   resolution fluorescence and refractive-index reconstruction,"Shwetadwip Chowdhury, Will J. Eldridge, Adam Wax, Joseph A.

Here, we demonstrate that SI can efficiently integrate the principles of fluorescent super-resolution and coherent synthetic aperture to achieve 3D dual-modality sub-diffraction resolution, fluorescence and refractive-index (RI) visualizations of biological samples. Such a demonstration can enable future biological studies to synergistically explore molecular and biophysical/biochemical mechanisms at sub-diffraction resolutions. We experimentally demonstrate this framework by introducing a SI microscope capable of 3D sub-diffraction fluorescence and RI imaging, and verify its biological visualization capabilities by experimentally reconstructing 3D RI/fluorescence visualizations of fluorescent calibration microspheres as well as alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma (A549) and human colorectal adenocarcinmoa (HT-29) cells, fluorescently stained for F-actin.",2017-08-15T21:06:59Z,2017-08-15T21:06:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04693v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04693v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph"

We show that a proper numerical modelling of the flow is necessary to access the stress applied by the latter on the droplet along its trajectory through the chip. This crucial step enables the full integration of the differential equation governing the dynamical deformation, and consequently the robust measurement of the interfacial tension by fitting the experiments with the calculated deformation.

Stochastic Proximal Gradient Algorithms for Multi-Source Quantitative   Photoacoustic Tomography,"Simon Rabanser, Lukas Neumann, Markus Haltmeier","The development of accurate and efficient image reconstruction algorithms is a central aspect of quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT). In this paper, we address this issues for multi-source QPAT using the radiative transfer equation (RTE) as accurate model for light transport. The tissue parameters are jointly reconstructed from the acoustical data measured for each of the applied sources. We develop stochastic proximal gradient methods for multi-source QPAT, which are more efficient than standard proximal gradient methods in which a single iterative update has complexity proportional to the number applies sources. Additionally, we introduce a completely new formulation of QPAT as multilinear (MULL) inverse problem which avoids explicitly solving the RTE. The MULL formulation of QPAT is again addressed with stochastic proximal gradient methods. Numerical results for both approaches are presented.

Tsunamis and Ripples: Effects of Scalar Waves on Screening in the Milky   Way,"Hiu Yan Sam Ip, Fabian Schmidt","Modified gravity models which include an additional propagating degree of freedom are typically studied in the quasi-static limit, where the propagation is neglected, and the wave equation of the field is replaced with a Poisson-type equation. Recently, it has been proposed that, in the context of models with symmetron- or chameleon-type screening, scalar waves from astrophysical or cosmological events could have a significant effect on the screening of the Solar System, and hence invalidate these models. Here, we quantitatively investigate the impact of scalar waves by solving the full field equation linearised in the wave amplitude. In the symmetron case, we find that the quantitative effect of waves is generally negligible, even for the largest amplitudes of waves that are physically expected. In order to spoil the screening in the Solar System, a significant amount of wave energy would have to be focused on the Solar System by arranging the sources in a spherical shell centred on Earth. In the chameleon case, we are able to rule out any significant effects of propagating waves on Solar System tests.",2018-01-23T09:38:51Z,2018-01-23T09:38:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07453v1,"gr-qc, astro-ph.CO"

On the quantitative calculation of the cosmological constant of the   quantum vacuum,Hongwei Xiong,"It is widely believed that as one of the candidates for dark energy, the cosmological constant should relate directly with the quantum vacuum. Despite decades of theoretical effects, however, there is still no quantitative interpretation of the observed cosmological constant. In this work, we consider the quantum state of the whole universe including the quantum vacuum. Everett's relative-state formulation, vacuum quantum fluctuations and the validity of Einstein's field equation at macroscopic scales imply that our universe wave function might be a superposition of states with different cosmological constants. In the density matrix formulation of this quantum universe, the quasi-thermal equilibrium state is described by a specific cosmological constant with the maximum probability. Without any fitting parameter, the ratio between the vacuum energy density due to the cosmological constant (dark energy) and the critical density of the universe is 68.85% based on simple equations in our theoretic model, which agrees very well with the best current astronomical observations of 68.5%.",2018-05-26T07:51:27Z,2018-05-26T07:51:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10440v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10440v1,"gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, hep-th, quant-ph"

Energy-Constrained Compression for Deep Neural Networks via Weighted   Sparse Projection and Layer Input Masking,"Haichuan Yang, Yuhao Zhu, Ji Liu","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in highly energy-constrained environments such as autonomous drones and wearable devices while at the same time must operate in real-time. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption has become a major design consideration in DNN training. This paper proposes the first end-to-end DNN training framework that provides quantitative energy consumption guarantees via weighted sparse projection and input masking. The key idea is to formulate the DNN training as an optimization problem in which the energy budget imposes a previously unconsidered optimization constraint. We integrate the quantitative DNN energy estimation into the DNN training process to assist the constrained optimization. We prove that an approximate algorithm can be used to efficiently solve the optimization problem.

The main mechanism behind the proofs is an order of vanishing estimate in combination with an iteration scheme.

Coupled with a dimensionality reduction first layer, the proposed MRF-Net is able to reconstruct quantitative maps by saving more than 60 times in memory and computations required for a DM baseline. Fine-grid manifold enumeration i.e. the MRF dictionary is only used for training the network and not during image reconstruction.

"Characteristic, completion or matching timescales? An analysis of   temporary boundaries in enzyme kinetics","Justin Eilertsen, Wylie Stroberg, Santiago Schnell","Scaling analysis exploiting timescale separation has been one of the most important techniques in the quantitative analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems in mathematical and theoretical biology. In the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions, it is often overlooked that the characteristic timescales used for the scaling the rate equations are not ideal for determining when concentrations and reaction rates reach their maximum values. In this work, we first illustrate this point by considering the classic example of the single-enzyme, single-substrate Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism. We then extend this analysis to a more complicated reaction mechanism, the auxiliary enzyme reaction, in which a substrate is converted to product in two sequential enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In this case, depending on the ordering of the relevant timescales, several dynamic regimes can emerge. In addition to the characteristic timescales for these regimes, we derive matching timescales that determine (approximately) when the transitions from initial fast transient to steady-state kinetics occurs.

As an application example of these inequalities, we derive quantitative wave-particle duality relations for multi-slit interferometry. Our framework leads to the identification of predictability measures complementary to Hilbert-Schmidt's, Wigner-Yanase's, and $l_{1}$-norm quantum coherences.

Equilibria in Quantitative Concurrent Games,"Shaull Almagor, Rajeev Alur, Suguman Bansal","Synthesis of finite-state controllers from high-level specifications in multi-agent systems can be reduced to solving multi-player concurrent games over finite graphs. The complexity of solving such games with qualitative objectives for agents, such as reaching a target set, is well understood resulting in tools with applications in robotics. In this paper, we introduce quantitative concurrent graph games, where transitions have separate costs for different agents, and each agent attempts to reach its target set while minimizing its own cost along the path. In this model, a solution to the game corresponds to a set of strategies, one per agent, that forms a Nash equilibrium. We study the problem of computing the set of all Pareto-optimal Nash equilibria, and give a comprehensive analysis of its complexity and related problems such as the price of stability and the price of anarchy. In particular, while checking the existence of a Nash equilibrium is NP-complete in general, with multiple parameters contributing to the computational hardness separately, two-player games with bounded costs on individual transitions admit a polynomial-time solution.",2018-09-27T13:14:17Z,2018-09-27T13:14:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10503v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10503v1,"cs.GT, cs.MA, I.2.11"
Joint non-rigid image registration and reconstruction for quantitative   atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy,"Benjamin Berkels, Christian H.

Here, a novel bias-corrected non-rigid registration approach is presented that compensates for fast and slow scan artifacts in STEM image series. The bias-correction is responsible for the correction of the slow scan artifacts and based on a explicit coupling of the deformations of the individual images in a series via a minimization of the average deformation. This allows to reduce fast scan noise in an image series and slow scan distortions simultaneously. The novel approach is tested on synthetic and experimental images and its implication on atomic resolution strain and elemental mapping is discussed.",2019-01-07T08:57:53Z,2019-01-14T19:08:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01709v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01709v2,"physics.app-ph, eess.IV"
Towards quantitative classification of Cayley automatic groups,"Dmitry Berdinsky, Phongpitak Trakuldit","In this paper we address the problem of quantitative classification of Cayley automatic groups in terms of a certain numerical characteristic which we earlier introduced for this class of groups.

As a corollary, we obtain high-dimensional versions of fourth moment theorems, universality results and Peccati-Tudor type theorems for homogeneous sums.

Types by Need (Extended Version),"Beniamino Accattoli, Giulio Guerrieri, Maico Leberle","A cornerstone of the theory of lambda-calculus is that intersection types characterise termination properties. They are a flexible tool that can be adapted to various notions of termination, and that also induces adequate denotational models.   Since the seminal work of de Carvalho in 2007, it is known that multi types (i.e. non-idempotent intersection types) refine intersection types with quantitative information and a strong connection to linear logic. Typically, type derivations provide bounds for evaluation lengths, and minimal type derivations provide exact bounds.   De Carvalho studied call-by-name evaluation, and Kesner used his system to show the termination equivalence of call-by-need and call-by-name. De Carvalho's system, however, cannot provide exact bounds on call-by-need evaluation lengths.   In this paper we develop a new multi type system for call-by-need.

A steady state approach is suited to analyze phenomena on the timescale of cell growth and circumvents the problem of incomplete experimental knowledge on kinetic laws and parameters, but it shall be supported by a correct implementation of thermodynamic constraints. In this article we review the latter aspect highlighting its computational challenges and physical insights.

Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures,"Giacomo Frangipane, Gaszton Vizsnyiczai, Claudio Maggi, Romolo Savo, Alfredo Sciortino, Sylvain Gigan, Roberto Di Leonardo","Motile cells often explore natural environments characterized by a high degree of structural complexity. Moreover cell motility is also intrinsically noisy due to spontaneous random reorientation and speed fluctuations. This interplay of internal and external noise sources gives rise to a complex dynamical behavior that can be strongly sensitive to details and hard to model quantitatively. In striking contrast to this general picture we show that the mean residence time of swimming bacteria inside artificial complex microstructures, can be quantitatively predicted by a generalization of a recently discovered invariance property of random walks. We find that variations in geometry and structural disorder have a dramatic effect on the distributions of path length while mean values are strictly constrained by the sole free volume to surface ratio.

This strategy arises as a robust and adaptive approach to solve data analysis problems. We compare the results of the heuristic with the most commonly used protocol by making a first quantitative error analysis to show its reliability.

This model, derived from a position-based interaction and a limited attention field, displays a non-equilibrium phase transition between a crystal-like phase, characterised by a single densely packed cluster of individuals, which occurs for small attention field angles, and a disordered phase, constituted of fragmented clusters, which emerges at large angles. The transition is quantitatively characterised, measuring its critical point and describing its scaling behaviour, which suggests that the nature of the transition is discontinuous.

New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology, used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully-chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms, used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information. In this article, we detail the antagonistic philosophies behind two quantitative approaches: certifying robust effects in understandable variables, and evaluating how accurately a built model can forecast future outcomes. We discourage choosing analysis tools via categories like 'statistics' or 'machine learning'. Rather, to establish reproducible knowledge about the brain, we advocate prioritizing tools in view of the core motivation of each quantitative analysis: aiming towards mechanistic insight, or optimizing predictive accuracy.",2019-02-21T13:08:29Z,2019-02-21T13:08:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10310v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10310v1,"q-bio.NC, stat.AP"

Styles","The forward model in diffuse optical tomography (DOT) describes how light propagates through a turbid medium. It is often approximated by a diffusion equation (DE) that is numerically discretized by the classical finite element method (FEM). We propose a nonlocal diffusion equation (NDE) as a new forward model for DOT, the discretization of which is carried out with an efficient graph-based numerical method (GNM). To quantitatively evaluate the new forward model, we first conduct experiments on a homogeneous slab, where the numerical accuracy of both NDE and DE is compared against the existing analytical solution. We further evaluate NDE by comparing its image reconstruction performance (inverse problem) to that of DE. Our experiments show that NDE is quantitatively comparable to DE and is up to 64% faster due to the efficient graph-based representation that can be implemented identically for geometries in different dimensions.",2019-06-03T15:40:51Z,2019-06-03T15:40:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00882v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00882v1,"physics.comp-ph, cs.CV"
Quantitative Propagation of Chaos in the bimolecular chemical   reaction-diffusion model,"Tau Shean Lim, Yulong Lu, James Nolen","We study a stochastic system of $N$ interacting particles which models bimolecular chemical reaction-diffusion. In this model, each particle $i$ carries two attributes: the spatial location $X_t^i\in \mathbb{T}^d$, and the type $\Xi_t^i\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$. While $X_t^i$ is a standard (independent) diffusion process, the evolution of the type $\Xi_t^i$ is described by pairwise interactions between different particles under a series of chemical reactions described by a chemical reaction network. We prove that in the large particle limit the stochastic dynamics converges to a mean field limit which is described by a nonlocal reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. In particular, we obtain a quantitative propagation of chaos result for the interacting particle system. Our proof is based on the relative entropy method used recently by Jabin and Wang \cite{JW18}. The key ingredient of the relative entropy method is a large deviation estimate for a special partition function, which was proved previously by technical combinatorial estimates.

We evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively the learned latent representation for a supervised task of splice site classification. The quantitative evaluation is done under two different settings. Our experiments show that these representations can be used as features or priors in closely related tasks such as splice site classification.

Multiscale Nakagami parametric imaging for improved liver tumor   localization,Omar S. Al-Kadi,"Effective ultrasound tissue characterization is usually hindered by complex tissue structures. The interlacing of speckle patterns complicates the correct estimation of backscatter distribution parameters. Nakagami parametric imaging based on localized shape parameter mapping can model different backscattering conditions. However, performance of the constructed Nakagami image depends on the sensitivity of the estimation method to the backscattered statistics and scale of analysis. Using a fixed focal region of interest in estimating the Nakagami parametric image would increase estimation variance. In this work, localized Nakagami parameters are estimated adaptively by means of maximum likelihood estimation on a multiscale basis. The varying size kernel integrates the goodness-of-fit of the backscattering distribution parameters at multiple scales for more stable parameter estimation. Results show improved quantitative visualization of changes in tissue specular reflections, suggesting a potential approach for improving tumor localization in low contrast ultrasound images.",2019-06-11T00:48:45Z,2019-06-11T00:48:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04333v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04333v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.QM, q-bio.TO"

It is demonstrated that the approach allows for tractable, analytic comparison between the given test and the benchmark, and for reliable quantitative evaluation of weighted statistics.

Quantitative convergence rates for reversible Markov chains via strong   random times,Daniel C. Jerison,"Let $(X_t)$ be a discrete time Markov chain on a general state space. It is well-known that if $(X_t)$ is aperiodic and satisfies a drift and minorization condition, then it converges to its stationary distribution $\pi$ at an exponential rate. We consider the problem of computing upper bounds for the distance from stationarity in terms of the drift and minorization data.   Baxendale showed that these bounds improve significantly if one assumes that $(X_t)$ is reversible with nonnegative eigenvalues (i.e. its transition kernel is a self-adjoint operator on $L^2(\pi)$ with spectrum contained in $[0,1]$). We identify this phenomenon as a special case of a general principle: for a reversible chain with nonnegative eigenvalues, any strong random time gives direct control over the convergence rate. We formulate this principle precisely and deduce from it a stronger version of Baxendale's result.   Our approach is fully quantitative and allows us to convert drift and minorization data into explicit convergence bounds.

However, both the large-scale trophic organization of this ecosystem, and its effects on the underlying metabolic flow, remain unexplored. Here, using a simplified model, we provide quantitative support for a multi-level trophic organization of the human gut microbiome, where microbes consume and secrete metabolites in multiple iterative steps. Using a manually-curated set of metabolic interactions between microbes, our model suggests about four trophic levels, each characterized by a high level-to-level metabolic transfer of byproducts. It also quantitatively predicts the typical metabolic environment of the gut (fecal metabolome) in approximate agreement with the real data. To understand the consequences of this trophic organization, we quantify the metabolic flow and biomass distribution, and explore patterns of microbial and metabolic diversity in different levels.

High-resolution 3D refractive index microscopy of multiple-scattering   samples from intensity images,"Shwetadwip Chowdhury, Michael Chen, Regina Eckert, David Ren, Fan Wu, Nicole Repina, Laura Waller","Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) reconstructs a samples volumetric refractive index (RI) to create high-contrast, quantitative 3D visualizations of biological samples. However, standard implementations of ODT use interferometric systems, and so are sensitive to phase instabilities, complex mechanical design, and coherent noise. Furthermore, their reconstruction framework is typically limited to weakly-scattering samples, and thus excludes a whole class of multiple-scattering samples. Here, we implement a new 3D RI microscopy technique that utilizes a computational multi-slice beam propagation method to invert the optical scattering process and reconstruct high-resolution (NA>1.0) 3D RI distributions of multiple-scattering samples. The method acquires intensity-only measurements from different illumination angles, and then solves a non-linear optimization problem to recover the sample 3D RI distribution. We experimentally demonstrate reconstruction of samples with varying amounts of multiple scattering: a 3T3 fibroblast cell, a cluster of C. elegans embryos, and a whole C. elegans worm, with lateral and axial resolutions of 250 nm and 900 nm, respectively.",2019-08-30T18:20:48Z,2019-09-09T21:51:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00023v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00023v2,"eess.IV, physics.comp-ph, q-bio.QM"
Four dimensional phase unwrapping of dynamic objects in digital   holography,"Gili Dardikman, Gyanendra Singh, Natan T. Shaked","We present a new four-dimensional phase unwrapping approach for time-lapse quantitative phase microscopy, which allows reconstruction of optically thick objects that are optically thin in a certain temporal point and angular view. We thus use all four dimensions of the dynamic quantitative phase profile acquired, including the angular dimension and the temporal dimension, in addition to the x-y dimensions. We first demonstrate the capabilities of this algorithm on simulative data, enabling the quantification of the reconstruction quality relative to both the ground truth and existing unwrapping approaches. Then, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed four-dimensional phase unwrapping algorithm by experimentally capturing a dual-angular dynamic off-axis hologram with simultaneous recording of two angular views, using multiplexing of two off-axis holograms into a single multiplexed hologram.",2019-09-03T13:40:07Z,2019-09-03T13:40:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01173v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01173v1,"physics.optics, eess.IV"
Network-Based Approach for Modeling and Analyzing Coronary Angiography,"Babak Ravandi, Arash Ravandi","Significant intra-observer and inter-observer variability in the interpretation of coronary angiograms are reported. This variability is in part due to the common practices that rely on performing visual inspections by specialists (e.g., the thickness of coronaries). Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) approaches are emerging to minimize observer's error and furthermore perform predictions and analysis on angiography images. However, QCA approaches suffer from the same problem as they mainly rely on performing visual inspections by utilizing image processing techniques.   In this work, we propose an approach to model and analyze the entire cardiovascular tree as a complex network derived from coronary angiography images. This approach enables to analyze the graph structure of coronary arteries. We conduct the assessments of network integration, degree distribution, and controllability on a healthy and a diseased coronary angiogram. Through our discussion and assessments, we propose modeling the cardiovascular system as a complex network is an essential phase to fully automate the interpretation of coronary angiographic images. We show how network science can provide a new perspective to look at coronary angiograms.",2019-09-05T22:50:35Z,2019-09-05T22:50:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02664v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02664v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.data-an, q-bio.TO, stat.AP"
Identifying and Explaining Discriminative Attributes,"Armins Stepanjans, André Freitas","Identifying what is at the center of the meaning of a word and what discriminates it from other words is a fundamental natural language inference task. This paper describes an explicit word vector representation model (WVM) to support the identification of discriminative attributes. A core contribution of the paper is a quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis of different types of data sources and Knowledge Bases in the construction of explainable and explicit WVMs: (i) knowledge graphs built from dictionary definitions, (ii) entity-attribute-relationships graphs derived from images and (iii) commonsense knowledge graphs. Using a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that these data sources have complementary semantic aspects, supporting the creation of explicit semantic vector spaces. The explicit vector spaces are evaluated using the task of discriminative attribute identification, showing comparable performance to the state-of-the-art systems in the task (F1-score = 0.69), while delivering full model transparency and explainability.",2019-09-05T01:13:41Z,2019-09-05T01:13:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05363v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05363v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI, I.2.7"
PubMedQA: A Dataset for Biomedical Research Question Answering,"Qiao Jin, Bhuwan Dhingra, Zhengping Liu, William W.

The task of PubMedQA is to answer research questions with yes/no/maybe (e.g.: Do preoperative statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?) using the corresponding abstracts. PubMedQA has 1k expert-annotated, 61.2k unlabeled and 211.3k artificially generated QA instances. Each PubMedQA instance is composed of (1) a question which is either an existing research article title or derived from one, (2) a context which is the corresponding abstract without its conclusion, (3) a long answer, which is the conclusion of the abstract and, presumably, answers the research question, and (4) a yes/no/maybe answer which summarizes the conclusion. PubMedQA is the first QA dataset where reasoning over biomedical research texts, especially their quantitative contents, is required to answer the questions. Our best performing model, multi-phase fine-tuning of BioBERT with long answer bag-of-word statistics as additional supervision, achieves 68.1% accuracy, compared to single human performance of 78.0% accuracy and majority-baseline of 55.2% accuracy, leaving much room for improvement.

Multi-FAN: Multi-Spectral Mosaic Super-Resolution Via Multi-Scale   Feature Aggregation Network,"Mehrdad Shoeiby, Sadegh Aliakbarian, Saeed Anwar, Lars Petersson","This paper introduces a novel method to super-resolve multi-spectral images captured by modern real-time single-shot mosaic image sensors, also known as multi-spectral cameras. Our contribution is two-fold. Firstly, we super-resolve multi-spectral images from mosaic images rather than image cubes, which helps to take into account the spatial offset of each wavelength. Secondly, we introduce an external multi-scale feature aggregation network (Multi-FAN) which concatenates the feature maps with different levels of semantic information throughout a super-resolution (SR) network. A cascade of convolutional layers then implicitly selects the most valuable feature maps to generate a mosaic image. This mosaic image is then merged with the mosaic image generated by the SR network to produce a quantitatively superior image. We apply our Multi-FAN to RCAN (Residual Channel Attention Network), which is the state-of-the-art SR algorithm. We show that Multi-FAN improves both quantitative results and well as inference time.",2019-09-17T03:53:20Z,2019-11-06T05:52:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07577v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07577v3,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Monitoring transition: expected night sky brightness trends in different   photometric bands,"Salvador Bará, Iago Rigueiro, Raul C. Lima","Several light pollution indicators are commonly used to monitor the effects of the transition from outdoor lighting systems based on traditional gas-discharge lamps to solid-state light sources. In this work we analyze a subset of these indicators, including the artificial zenithal night sky brightness in the visual photopic and scotopic bands, the brightness in the specific photometric band of the widely used Sky Quality Meter (SQM), and the top-of-atmosphere radiance detected by the VIIRS-DNB radiometer onboard the satellite Suomi-NPP. Using a single-scattering approximation in a layered atmosphere we quantitatively show that, depending on the transition scenarios, these indicators may show different, even opposite behaviors. This is mainly due to the combined effects of the changes in the sources' spectra and angular radiation patterns, the wavelength-dependent atmospheric propagation processes and the differences in the detector spectral sensitivity bands. It is suggested that the possible presence of this differential behavior should be taken into account when evaluating light pollution indicator datasets for assessing the outcomes of public policy decisions regarding the upgrading of outdoor lighting systems.",2019-09-24T13:35:44Z,2019-09-24T13:35:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10909v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10909v1,"astro-ph.IM, physics.ao-ph"

Assuming sufficient smoothness for $G$, we give a ""tame"" bound on the $H^n$ norm of this composite function in terms of a linear function of the $H^n$ norm of $f$, with a coefficient depending on $G$ and on the $H^a$ norm of $f$, for all integers $n, a, d$ with $a > d/2$. In comparison with previous results on this subject, our bound is fully explicit, allowing to estimate quantitatively the $H^n$ norm of the function $x \mapsto G(f(x),x)$. When applied to the case $G(f(x), x) = f^2(x)$, this bound agrees with a previous result of ours on the pointwise product of functions in Sobolev spaces.",2003-05-23T13:53:22Z,2004-10-25T16:32:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305331v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0305331v3,"math.FA, math-ph, math.MP, 46E35, 26D10, 47A60"

Feng","We use entropy to characterize intrinsic ageing properties of the human brain. Analysis of fMRI data from a large dataset of individuals, using resting state BOLD signals, demonstrated that a functional entropy associated with brain activity increases with age. During an average lifespan, the entropy, which was calculated from a population of individuals, increased by approximately 0.1 bits, due to correlations in BOLD activity becoming more widely distributed. We attribute this to the number of excitatory neurons and the excitatory conductance decreasing with age. Incorporating these properties into a computational model leads to quantitatively similar results to the fMRI data. Our dataset involved males and females and we found significant differences between them. The entropy of males at birth was lower than that of females. However, the entropies of the two sexes increase at different rates, and intersect at approximately 50 years; after this age, males have a larger entropy.",2014-06-08T12:03:11Z,2014-06-08T12:03:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1976v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1976v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.med-ph, q-bio.NC"
The Natural Science Underlying Big History,Eric J. Chaisson,"Nature's many varied complex systems (including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society) are islands of order within the increasingly disordered universe. All organized systems are subject to physical, biological or cultural evolution, which together comprise the grander interdisciplinary subject of cosmic evolution. This is global history greatly extended, big history with a scientific basis, and natural history broadly portrayed across 14 billion years of time. Such evolution writ large has significant potential to unify the natural sciences into a holistic understanding of who we are and whence we came. No new science (beyond frontier, non-equilibrium thermodynamics) is needed to describe cosmic evolution's major milestones at a deep and empirical level. Quantitative models and experimental tests imply that a remarkable simplicity underlies the emergence and growth of complexity for a wide spectrum of known and diverse systems. In particular, energy rate density is an objective metric suitable to gauge relative degrees of complexity along a hierarchy of widely assorted systems observed throughout the material universe.",2014-06-10T21:58:41Z,2014-06-10T21:58:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2730v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2730v1,"physics.pop-ph, astro-ph.CO, q-bio.OT"
Practical Applications of Cosmology to Human Society,Eric J. Chaisson,"Complex systems throughout Nature display structures and functions that are built and maintained, at least in part, by optimal energies flowing through them--not specific, ideal values, rather ranges in energy rate density below which systems are starved and above which systems are destroyed. Cosmic evolution, as a physical cosmology that notably includes life, is rich in empirical findings about many varied systems that can potentially help assess global problems facing us here on Earth. Despite its grand and ambitious objective to unify theoretical understanding of all known complex systems from big bang to humankind, cosmic evolution does have useful, practical applications from which humanity could benefit. Cosmic evolution's emphasis on quantitative data analyses might well inform our attitudes toward several serious issues now challenging 21st-century society, including global warming, smart machines, world economics, and cancer research.

We show that when the coefficients are known to be piecewise constant functions, a unique solution can be obtained.

We provide sufficient conditions for this principle to be true in a general context, valid for certain discrete probability distributions which are $\textit{perturbed log-concave}$, via a quantitative local central limit theorem.

Single-cell unroofing: probing topology and nanomechanics of native   membranes,Nicola Galvanetto,"Cell membranes separate the cell interior from the external environment. They are constituted by a variety of lipids; their composition determines the dynamics of membrane proteins and affects the ability of the cells to adapt. Even though the study of model membranes allows to understand the interactions among lipids and the overall mechanics, little is known about these properties in native membranes. To combine topology and nanomechanics analysis of native membranes, I designed a method to investigate the plasma membranes isolated from a variety of single cells. Five cell types were chosen and tested, revealing 20\% variation in membrane thickness. I probed the resistance of the isolated membranes to indent, finding their line tension and spreading pressure. These results show that membranes isolated from neurons are stiffer and less diffusive than brain cancer cell membranes.

We also introduce a new adaptive Kernel Density Estimation particularly coupled with the t-SNE framework in order to get accurate density estimates out of the embedded data, and a variant of the rainfalling watershed algorithm to identify clusters within the density landscape. The whole mapping protocol is wrapped in the bigMap R package, together with visualization and analysis tools to ease the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the clustering.",2018-12-24T09:21:09Z,2019-11-04T16:02:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09869v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09869v2,"cs.LG, q-bio.QM"
Topological and geometrical quantities in active cellular structures,"Dennis Wenzel, Simon Praetorius, Axel Voigt","Topological and geometrical properties and the associated topological defects find a rapidly growing interest in studying the interplay between mechanics and the collective behavior of cells on the tissue level. We here test if well studied equilibrium laws for polydisperse passive systems such as the Lewis's and the Aboav-Weaire's law are applicable also for active cellular structures. Large scale simulations, which are based on a multi phase field active polar gel model, indicate that these active cellular structures follow these laws. If the system is in a state of collective motion also quantitative agreement with typical values for passive systems is observed. If this state has not developed quantitative differences can be found. We further compare the model with discrete modeling approaches for cellular structures and show that essential properties, such as T1 transitions and rosettes are naturally fulfilled.",2018-12-17T09:40:24Z,2019-04-05T10:27:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10416v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10416v2,"cond-mat.soft, q-bio.CB, 35K25"
Opinion Dynamics Theory for Analysis of Consensus Formation and Division   of Opinion on the Internet,"Akira Ishii, Yasuko Kawahata","The massive amount of text data on the web has facilitated research on the quantitative analysis of public opinion, which could not be visualized earlier. In this paper, we propose a new opinion dynamics theory. This theory that is intended to explain agreement formation and opinion breakup division in opinion exchanges on social media such as Twitter. With the popularization of the public network, we have become able to communicate with instantaneity and interactivity beyond the temporal and spatial constraints.Research on quantitatively analyzing the distribution of opinion on public opinion that has not been visualized so far utilizing massive web text data is progressing.Our model is based on the Bounded Confidence Model, that expresses opinions in as continuous quantity values.

Our results can be used to demonstrate at a desired significance level that a given Markov Chain state (e.g., a districting) is extremely unusual (rather than just atypical) with respect to the fragility of its characteristics in the chain.

A generalized kinetic framework applied to whole-cell catalysis in   biofilm flow reactors clarifies performance enhancements,"Mir Pouyan Zarabadi, Manon Couture, Steve J. Charette, Jesse Greener","A common kinetic framework for studies of whole-cell catalysis is vital for understanding and optimizing bioflow reactors. In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of a flow-adapted version of Michaelis-Menten kinetics to a catalytic bacterial biofilm. A three-electrode microfluidic electrochemical flow cell measured increased turnover rates by as much as 50% from a Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilm as flow rate was varied. Based on parameters from the applied kinetic framework, flow-induced increases to turnover rate, catalytic efficiency and device reaction capacity could be linked to an increase in catalytic biomass. This study demonstrates that a standardized kinetic framework is critical for quantitative measurements of new living catalytic systems in flow cells and for benchmarking against well-studied catalytic systems such as enzymes.",2019-04-10T19:56:15Z,2019-04-10T19:56:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05412v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05412v1,"q-bio.QM, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.CB"
Towards Photographic Image Manipulation with Balanced Growing of   Generative Autoencoders,"Ari Heljakka, Arno Solin, Juho Kannala","We present a generative autoencoder that provides fast encoding, faithful reconstructions (eg. retaining the identity of a face), sharp generated/reconstructed samples in high resolutions, and a well-structured latent space that supports semantic manipulation of the inputs. There are no current autoencoder or GAN models that satisfactorily achieve all of these. We build on the progressively growing autoencoder model PIONEER, for which we completely alter the training dynamics based on a careful analysis of recently introduced normalization schemes. We show significantly improved visual and quantitative results for face identity conservation in CelebAHQ. Our model achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement of latent space, both quantitatively and via realistic image attribute manipulations. On the LSUN Bedrooms dataset, we improve the disentanglement performance of the vanilla PIONEER, despite having a simpler model.

Avalanche statistics during coarsening dynamics,"Francesca Pelusi, Mauro Sbragaglia, Roberto Benzi","We study the coarsening dynamics of a two dimensional system via lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations. The system under consideration is a biphasic system consisting of domains of a dispersed phase closely packed together in a continuous phase and separated by thin interfaces. Such system is elastic and typically out of equilibrium. The equilibrium state is attained via the coarsening dynamics, wherein the dispersed phase slowly diffuses through the interfaces, causing domains to change in size and eventually rearrange abruptly. The effect of rearrangements is propagated throughout the system via the intrinsic elastic interactions and may cause rearrangements elsewhere, resulting in intermittent bursts of activity and avalanche behaviour. Here we aim at quantitatively characterizing the corresponding avalanche statistics (i.e. size, duration, inter-avalanche time). Despite the coarsening dynamics is triggered by an internal driving mechanism, we find quantitative indications that such avalanche statistics displays scaling-laws very similar to those observed in the response of disordered materials to external loads.",2019-04-05T13:01:45Z,2019-04-05T13:01:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06415v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06415v1,"cond-mat.soft, physics.flu-dyn"
Convergence of diffusions and their discretizations: from continuous to   discrete processes and back,"Valentin De Bortoli, Alain Durmus","In this paper, we establish new quantitative convergence bounds for a class of functional autoregressive models in weighted total variation metrics. To derive our results, we show that under mild assumptions, explicit minorization and Foster-Lyapunov drift conditions hold. The main applications and consequences of the bounds we obtain concern the geometric convergence of Euler-Maruyama discretizations of diffusions with identity covariance matrix. Second, as a corollary, we provide a new approach to establish quantitative convergence of these diffusion processes by applying our conclusions in the discrete-time setting to a well-suited sequence of discretizations whose associated stepsizes decrease towards zero.",2019-04-22T12:05:46Z,2020-05-01T19:26:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09808v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09808v4,"math.PR, stat.CO"

It was shown recently that if $g$ is well-localized both in time and frequency, then $\mathcal G$ cannot contain any time-frequency shift $\pi(z) g$ of $g$ with $z\notin\Lambda$. In this paper, we improve the result to the quantitative statement that the $L^2$-distance of $\pi(z)g$ to the space $\mathcal G$ is equivalent to the Euclidean distance of $z$ to the lattice $\Lambda$, in the sense that the ratio between those two distances is uniformly bounded above and below by positive constants.

Radiation from Global Topological Strings using Adaptive Mesh   Refinement: Methodology and Massless Modes,"Amelia Drew, E. P. S.

We perform a quantitative investigation of the dynamics of single sinusoidally displaced string configurations, studying a wide range of string energy densities $\mu \propto \ln{\lambda}$, defined by the string width parameter $\lambda$ over two orders of magnitude. We investigate the resulting massless (Goldstone boson or axion) radiation signals, using quantitative diagnostic tools to determine the eigenmode decomposition. Given analytic radiation predictions, we compare the oscillating string trajectory with a backreaction model accounting for radiation energy losses, finding excellent agreement. We establish that backreaction decay is accurately characterised by the inverse square of the amplitude being proportional to the inverse tension $\mu$ for $3\lesssim \lambda \lesssim 100$. We conclude that analytic radiation modelling in the thin-string (Nambu-Goto) limit provides the appropriate cosmological limit for global strings.

Computational Approach to Dark-Field Optical Diffraction Tomography,"Taean Chang, Seungwoo Shin, Moosung Lee, YongKeun Park","The measurement of three-dimensional (3D) images and the analysis of subcellular organelles are crucial for the study of the pathophysiology of cells and tissues. Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) facilitates label-free and quantitative imaging of live cells by reconstructing 3D refractive index (RI) distributions. In many cases, however, the contrast in RI distributions is not strong enough to effectively distinguish subcellular organelles in live cells. To realize label-free and quantitative imaging of subcellular organelles in unlabeled live cells with enhanced contrasts, we present a computational approach using ODT. We demonstrate that the contrast of ODT can be enhanced via spatial high-pass filtering in a 3D spatial frequency domain, and that it yields theoretically equivalent results to physical dark-field illumination. Without changing the optical instruments used in ODT, subcellular organelles in live cells are clearly distinguished by applying a simple but effective computational approach that is validated by comparison with 3D epifluorescence images. We expect that the proposed method will satisfy the demand for label-free organelle observations, and will be extended to fully utilize complex information in 3D RI distributions.",2019-10-04T11:30:26Z,2019-10-04T11:30:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02773v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02773v1,"eess.IV, physics.bio-ph, physics.optics"
LinesToFacePhoto: Face Photo Generation from Lines with Conditional   Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network,"Yuhang Li, Xuejin Chen, Feng Wu, Zheng-Jun Zha","In this paper, we explore the task of generating photo-realistic face images from lines. Previous methods based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) have shown their power to generate visually plausible images when a conditional image and an output image share well-aligned structures. However, these models fail to synthesize face images with a whole set of well-defined structures, e.g. eyes, noses, mouths, etc., especially when the conditional line map lacks one or several parts. To address this problem, we propose a conditional self-attention generative adversarial network (CSAGAN). We introduce a conditional self-attention mechanism to cGANs to capture long-range dependencies between different regions in faces. We also build a multi-scale discriminator. The large-scale discriminator enforces the completeness of global structures and the small-scale discriminator encourages fine details, thereby enhancing the realism of generated face images. We evaluate the proposed model on the CelebA-HD dataset by two perceptual user studies and three quantitative metrics. The experiment results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality facial images while preserving facial structures.

Such phenomenon can be quantitatively evaluated with the irreversible entropy generation (IEG), which was recently found to follow a $1/\tau$ scaling for the system under a long contact time $\tau$ with the thermal bath. This scaling, predicted in many finite-time thermodynamic models, is of great potential in the optimization of heat engines, yet remains lack of direct experimental validation. In this letter, we design an experimental apparatus to test such scaling by compressing dry air in a temperature-controlled water bath. More importantly, we quantitatively verify the optimized control protocol to reduce the IEG. Such optimization shall bring new insight to the practical design of heat engine cycles.",2019-10-29T17:50:05Z,2019-10-31T17:10:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13434v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13434v3,"cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.class-ph, quant-ph"
One-Shot Pruning of Recurrent Neural Networks by Jacobian Spectrum   Evaluation,"Matthew Shunshi Zhang, Bradly Stadie","Recent advances in the sparse neural network literature have made it possible to prune many large feed forward and convolutional networks with only a small quantity of data. Yet, these same techniques often falter when applied to the problem of recovering sparse recurrent networks. These failures are quantitative: when pruned with recent techniques, RNNs typically obtain worse performance than they do under a simple random pruning scheme. The failures are also qualitative: the distribution of active weights in a pruned LSTM or GRU network tend to be concentrated in specific neurons and gates, and not well dispersed across the entire architecture. We seek to rectify both the quantitative and qualitative issues with recurrent network pruning by introducing a new recurrent pruning objective derived from the spectrum of the recurrent Jacobian. Our objective is data efficient (requiring only 64 data points to prune the network), easy to implement, and produces 95% sparse GRUs that significantly improve on existing baselines.

Under this design, the measured field combines linear forward-scattering and height-dependent nonlinear back-scattering from the object that complicates object phase recovery. Using only the forward-scattering, we derive a linear inverse scattering model and evaluate this model's validity range in simulation and experiment using a standard reflection microscope modified with a programmable light source.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of asynchronous neural activity,"Ekkehard Ullner, Antonio Politi, Alessandro Torcini","The activity of a sparse network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons is carefully revisited with reference to a regime of a bona-fide asynchronous dynamics. The study is preceded by a finite-size scaling analysis, carried out to identify a setup where collective synchronization is negligible. The comparison between quenched and annealed networks reveals the emergence of substantial differences when the coupling strength is increased, via a scenario somehow reminiscent of a phase transition. For sufficiently strong synaptic coupling, quenched networks exhibit a highly bursting neural activity, well reproduced by a self-consistent approach, based on the assumption that the input synaptic current is the superposition of independent renewal processes. The distribution of interspike intervals turns out to be relatively long-tailed; a crucial feature required for the self-sustainment of the bursting activity in a regime where neurons operate on average (much) below threshold. A semi-quantitative analogy with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes helps validating this interpretation. Finally, an alternative explanation in terms of Poisson processes is offered under the additional assumption of mutual correlations among excitatory and inhibitory spikes.",2019-12-19T14:15:11Z,2019-12-19T14:15:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09207v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09207v1,"q-bio.NC, nlin.AO"

We first demonstrate existence of minimizers for an explicit range of the model parameters when the energy is dominated by the exchange energy. We then investigate the conformal limit, in which only the exchange energy survives and identify the asymptotic profiles of the skyrmions as degree 1 harmonic maps from the plane to the sphere, together with their radii, angles and energies.

Uncertainty-Aware Lookahead Factor Models for Quantitative Investing,"Lakshay Chauhan, John Alberg, Zachary C.

Quantitative finance research has identified several factors, functions of the reported data that historically correlate with stock market performance. In this paper, we first show through simulation that if we could select stocks via factors calculated on future fundamentals (via oracle), that our portfolios would far outperform standard factor models. Motivated by this insight, we train deep nets to forecast future fundamentals from a trailing 5-year history. We propose lookahead factor models which plug these predicted future fundamentals into traditional factors. Finally, we incorporate uncertainty estimates from both neural heteroscedastic regression and a dropout-based heuristic, improving performance by adjusting our portfolios to avert risk. In retrospective analysis, we leverage an industry-grade portfolio simulator (backtester) to show simultaneous improvement in annualized return and Sharpe ratio. Specifically, the simulated annualized return for the uncertainty-aware model is 17.7% (vs 14.0% for a standard factor model) and the Sharpe ratio is 0.84 (vs 0.52).",2020-07-07T00:18:40Z,2020-07-15T16:52:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04082v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04082v2,"q-fin.ST, cs.LG, cs.NE"

We show that in this case the zero-noise limit has a quadratic speed of convergence, as conjectured by Lin, in 2005, after numerical experiments (see arXiv:math/0406201 ). This is obtained by providing an explicit formula for the first and second term in the Taylor's expansion of the response of the stationary measure to the small noise perturbation.

Calibration-free quantitative phase imaging using data-driven aberration   modeling,"Taean Chang, Youngju Jo, Gunho Choi, Donghun Ryu, Hyun-Seok Min, Yongkeun Park","We present a data-driven approach to compensate for optical aberration in calibration-free quantitative phase imaging (QPI). Unlike existing methods that require additional measurements or a background region to correct aberrations, we exploit deep learning techniques to model the physics of aberration in an imaging system. We demonstrate the generation of a single-shot aberration-corrected field image by using a U-net-based deep neural network that learns a translation between an optical field with aberrations and an aberration-corrected field. The high fidelity of our method is demonstrated on 2D and 3D QPI measurements of various confluent eukaryotic cells, benchmarking against the conventional method using background subtractions.",2020-07-26T01:20:24Z,2020-07-26T01:20:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13038v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13038v1,"eess.IV, physics.optics"
Statistical dynamics of social distancing in SARS-CoV-2 as a   differential game,Chris von Csefalvay,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly emerged as a significant threat to global public health, in particular because -- as is not uncommon with novel pathogens -- there is no effective pharmaceutical treatment or prophylaxis to the viral syndrome it causes. In the absence of such specific treatment modalities, the mainstay of public health response rests on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing. This paper contributes to the understanding of social distancing against SARS-CoV-2 by quantitatively analysing the statistical dynamics of disease propagation as a differential game, and estimating the relative costs of distancing versus not distancing, identifying marginal utility of distancing based on known population epidemiological data about SARS-CoV-2 and concluding that unless the costs of distancing vastly exceed the cost of illness per unit time, social distancing remains a dominant strategy. These findings can assist in solidly anchoring public health responses based on social distancing within a quantitative framework attesting to their effectiveness.",2020-07-24T20:58:39Z,2020-07-24T20:58:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13734v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13734v1,"stat.AP, physics.soc-ph, q-bio.PE"
Functions on a convex set which are both $ω$-semiconvex and   $ω$-semiconcave,"Václav Kryštof, Luděk Zajíček","Let $G \subset {\mathbb R}^{n}$ be an open convex set which is either bounded or contains a translation of a convex cone with nonempty interior. It is known that then, for every modulus $\omega$, every function on $G$ which is both semiconvex and semiconcave with modulus $\omega$ is (globally) $C^{1,\omega}$-smooth. We show that this result is optimal in the sense that the assumption on $G$ cannot be relaxed. We also present direct short proofs of the above mentioned result and of some its quantitative versions. Our results have immediate consequences concerning (i) a first-order quantitative converse Taylor theorem and (ii) the problem whether $f\in C^{1,\omega}(G)$ whenever $f$ is continuous and smooth in a corresponding sense on all lines.

GestureMap: Supporting Visual Analytics and Quantitative Analysis of   Motion Elicitation Data by Learning 2D Embeddings,"Hai Dang, Daniel Buschek","This paper presents GestureMap, a visual analytics tool for gesture elicitation which directly visualises the space of gestures. Concretely, a Variational Autoencoder embeds gestures recorded as 3D skeletons on an interactive 2D map. GestureMap further integrates three computational capabilities to connect exploration to quantitative measures: Leveraging DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA), we compute average gestures to 1) represent gesture groups at a glance; 2) compute a new consensus measure (variance around average gesture); and 3) cluster gestures with k-means. We evaluate GestureMap and its concepts with eight experts and an in-depth analysis of published data. Our findings show how GestureMap facilitates exploring large datasets and helps researchers to gain a visual understanding of elicited gesture spaces. It further opens new directions, such as comparing elicitations across studies. We discuss implications for elicitation studies and research, and opportunities to extend our approach to additional tasks in gesture elicitation.",2021-03-01T11:00:23Z,2021-03-01T11:00:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00912v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00912v1,"cs.HC, H.5.2"
Have We Learned to Explain?: How Interpretability Methods Can Learn to   Encode Predictions in their Interpretations,"Neil Jethani, Mukund Sudarshan, Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs, Rajesh Ranganath","While the need for interpretable machine learning has been established, many common approaches are slow, lack fidelity, or hard to evaluate. Amortized explanation methods reduce the cost of providing interpretations by learning a global selector model that returns feature importances for a single instance of data. The selector model is trained to optimize the fidelity of the interpretations, as evaluated by a predictor model for the target. Popular methods learn the selector and predictor model in concert, which we show allows predictions to be encoded within interpretations. We introduce EVAL-X as a method to quantitatively evaluate interpretations and REAL-X as an amortized explanation method, which learn a predictor model that approximates the true data generating distribution given any subset of the input. We show EVAL-X can detect when predictions are encoded in interpretations and show the advantages of REAL-X through quantitative and radiologist evaluation.",2021-03-02T17:42:33Z,2021-03-02T17:42:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01890v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01890v1,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG"
Synplex: A synthetic simulator of highly multiplexed histological images,"Daniel Jiménez-Sánchez, Mikel Ariz, Carlos Ortiz-de-Solórzano","Multiplex tissue immunostaining is a technology of growing relevance as it can capture in situ the complex interactions existing between the elements of the tumor microenvironment. The existence and availability of large, annotated image datasets is key for the objective development and benchmarking of bioimage analysis algorithms. Manual annotation of multiplex images, is however, laborious, often impracticable. In this paper, we present Synplex, a simulation system able to generate multiplex immunostained in situ tissue images based on user-defined parameters. This includes the specification of structural attributes, such as the number of cell phenotypes, the number and level of expression of cellular markers, or the cell morphology. Synplex consists of three sequential modules, each being responsible for a separate task: modeling of cellular neighborhoods, modeling of cell phenotypes, and synthesis of realistic cell/tissue textures. Synplex flexibility and accuracy are demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively by generating synthetic tissues that simulate disease paradigms found in the real scenarios.

Quantitative Performance Assessment of CNN Units via Topological Entropy   Calculation,"Yang Zhao, Hao Zhang","Identifying the status of individual network units is critical for understanding the mechanism of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it is still challenging to reliably give a general indication of unit status, especially for units in different network models. To this end, we propose a novel method for quantitatively clarifying the status of single unit in CNN using algebraic topological tools. Unit status is indicated via the calculation of a defined topological-based entropy, called feature entropy, which measures the degree of chaos of the global spatial pattern hidden in the unit for a category. In this way, feature entropy could provide an accurate indication of status for units in different networks with diverse situations like weight-rescaling operation. Further, we show that feature entropy decreases as the layer goes deeper and shares almost simultaneous trend with loss during training. We show that by investigating the feature entropy of units on only training data, it could give discrimination between networks with different generalization ability from the view of the effectiveness of feature representations.",2021-03-17T15:18:18Z,2022-03-17T08:58:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09716v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09716v5,"cs.CV, cs.LG, I.2.10"
DNA Supercoiling Drives a Transition between Collective Modes of Gene   Synthesis,"Purba Chatterjee, Nigel Goldenfeld, Sangjin Kim","Recent experiments showed that multiple copies of the molecular machine RNA polymerase (RNAP) can efficiently synthesize mRNA collectively in the active state of the promoter. However, environmentally-induced promoter repression results in long-distance antagonistic interactions that drastically reduce the speed of RNAPs and cause a quick arrest of mRNA synthesis. The mechanism underlying this transition between cooperative and antagonistic dynamics remains poorly understood. In this Letter, we introduce a continuum deterministic model for the translocation of RNAPs, where the speed of an RNAP is coupled to the local DNA supercoiling as well as the density of RNAPs on the gene. We assume that torsional stress experienced by individual RNAPs is exacerbated by high RNAP density on the gene and that transcription factors act as physical barriers to the diffusion of DNA supercoils. We show that this minimal model exhibits two transcription modes mediated by the torsional stress: a fluid mode when the promoter is active and a torsionally stressed mode when the promoter is repressed, in quantitative agreement with experimentally observed dynamics of co-transcribing RNAPs. Our work provides an important step towards understanding the collective dynamics of molecular machines involved in gene expression.",2021-03-19T17:56:15Z,2021-03-19T17:56:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10947v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10947v1,"q-bio.SC, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"
Controlling anisotropy in 2D microscopic models of growth,"Luca Gagliardi, Olivier Pierre-Louis","The quantitative knowledge of interface anisotropy in lattice models is a major issue, both for the parametrization of continuum interface models, and for the analysis of experimental observations. In this paper, we focus on the anisotropy of line tension and stiffness, which plays a major role both in equilibrium shapes and fluctuations, and in the selection of nonequilibrium growth patterns. We consider a 2D Ising Hamiltonian on a square lattice with first and second-nearest-neighbor interactions. The surface stiffness and line tension are calculated by means of a broken-bond model for arbitrary orientations. The analysis of the interface energy allows us to determine the conditions under which stiffness anisotropy is minimal. These results are supported by a quantitative comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, based on the coupling of a field of mobile atoms to a condensed phase. Furthermore, we introduce a generic smoothing parameter which allows one to mimic the finite resolution of experimental microscopy techniques. Our results provide a method to fine-tune the interface energy in models of nanoscale non-equilibrium processes, where anisotropy and fluctuations combine and give rise to non-trivial morphologies.",2021-03-29T12:08:41Z,2021-11-13T18:03:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15535v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15535v2,"cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.atm-clus, physics.comp-ph"

This procedure is completely general and can be applied to any weighted network to detect the underlying structure of transport flows.

Non-coding DNA programs express adaptation and its universal law,Mark Ya. Azbel,"Significant fraction (98.5% in humans) of most animal genomes is non- coding dark matter. Its largely unknown function (1-5) is related to programming (rather than to spontaneous mutations) of accurate adaptation to rapidly changing environment. Programmed adaptation to the same universal law for non-competing animals from anaerobic yeast to human is revealed in the study of their extensively quantified mortality (6-21). Adaptation of animals with removed non-coding DNA fractions may specify their contribution to genomic programming. Emergence of new adaptation programs and their (non-Mendelian) heredity may be studied in antibiotic mini-extinctions (22-24). On a large evolutionary scale rapid universal adaptation was vital for survival, and evolved, in otherwise lethal for diverse species major mass extinctions (25-28). Evolutionary and experimental data corroborate these conclusions (6-21, 29-32). Universal law implies certain biological universality of diverse species, thus quantifies applicability of animal models to humans).

Explicit estimates for solutions of mixed elliptic problems,Luisa Consiglieri,"We deal with the existence of quantitative estimates for solutions of mixed problems to an elliptic second order equation in divergence form with discontinuous coefficient. Our concern is to estimate the solutions with explicit constants, for domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) of class $C^{0,1}$. The existence of $L^\infty$ and $W^{1,q}$-estimates is assured for $q=2$ and any $q<n/(n-1)$ (depending on the data), whenever the coefficient is only measurable and bounded. The proof method of the quantitative $L^\infty$-estimates is based on the DeGiorgi technique developed by Stampacchia. By using the potential theory, we derive $W^{1,p}$-estimates for different ranges of the exponent $p$ depending on that the coefficient is either Dini-continuous or only measurable and bounded. In this process, we establish new existences of Green functions on such domains. The last but not least concern is to unify (whenever possible) the proofs of the estimates to the extreme Dirichlet and Neumann cases of the mixed problem.",2013-12-02T20:35:53Z,2013-12-02T20:35:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0584v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0584v1,"math.AP, 35J25, 35D30, 35B50, 35C15, 35J08, 35B65"

The original definition of the game is inherently finite and therefore does not allow one to model infinite processes. We propose an extension of the sabotage games in which the first player (Runner) traverses an arena with dynamic weights determined by the second player (Saboteur). In our model of quantitative sabotage games, Saboteur is now given a budget that he can distribute amongst the edges of the graph, whilst Runner attempts to minimise the quantity of budget witnessed while completing his task. We show that, on the one hand, for most of the classical cost functions considered in the literature, the problem of determining if Runner has a strategy to ensure a cost below some threshold is EXPTIME-complete. On the other hand, if the budget of Saboteur is fixed a priori, then the problem is in PTIME for most cost functions.

Relative entropy - that is, the Kullback--Leibler divergence, or various generalizations of this - provides a quantitative measure of how far from equilibrium the system is. We explain various theorems that give conditions under which relative entropy is nonincreasing. In biochemical applications these results can be seen as versions of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, stating that free energy can never increase with the passage of time.

In the particular cases when $d=1$ and the Choquet integral is taken with respect to some concrete possibility measures, the pointwise estimate in terms of the modulus of continuity is detailed.

Hydraulic flow rates are measured by applying hydrostatic pressures via inert gases (argon and helium, pressurized up to 70 bar) on the upstream side in a capacitor-based membrane permeability setup. For the native, hydrophilic silica walls, the measured hydraulic permeabilities can be quantitatively accounted for by bulk fluidity provided we assume a sticking boundary layer, i.e. a negative velocity slip length of molecular dimensions. The thickness of this boundary layer is discussed with regard to previous capillarity-driven flow experiments (spontaneous imbibition) and with regard to velocity slippage at the pore walls resulting from dissolved gas. Water flow across the silanized, hydrophobic nanopores is blocked up to a hydrostatic pressure of at least 70 bar.

Previous works have considered NWA that processed input words only in the forward direction. It is natural to allow the automata to process input words backwards as well, for example, to measure the maximal or average time between a response and the preceding request. We therefore introduce and study bidirectional NWA that can process input words in both directions. First, we show that bidirectional NWA can express interesting quantitative properties that are not expressible by forward-only NWA. Second, for the fundamental decision problems of emptiness and universality, we establish decidability and complexity results for the new framework which match the best-known results for the special case of forward-only NWA. Thus, for NWA, the increased expressiveness of bidirectionality is achieved at no additional computational complexity.

Academic research has identified some factors, i.e. computed features of the reported data, that are known through retrospective analysis to outperform the market average. Two popular factors are the book value normalized by market capitalization (book-to-market) and the operating income normalized by the enterprise value (EBIT/EV). In this paper: we first show through simulation that if we could (clairvoyantly) select stocks using factors calculated on future fundamentals (via oracle), then our portfolios would far outperform a standard factor approach. Motivated by this analysis, we train deep neural networks to forecast future fundamentals based on a trailing 5-years window. Quantitative analysis demonstrates a significant improvement in MSE over a naive strategy. Moreover, in retrospective analysis using an industry-grade stock portfolio simulator (backtester), we show an improvement in compounded annual return to 17.1% (MLP) vs 14.4% for a standard factor model.",2017-11-13T20:30:02Z,2018-04-26T03:19:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04837v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04837v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG, cs.NE"
Observation-based symmetry breaking measures,Ivan Fernandez-Corbaton,"Symmetry is one of the most general and useful concepts in physics. A theory or a system that has a symmetry is fundamentally constrained by it. The same constraints do not apply when the symmetry is broken. The quantitative determination of ""how much a system breaks a symmetry"" allows to reach beyond this binary situation and is a necessary step towards the quantitative connection between symmetry breaking and its effects. We introduce measures of symmetry breaking for a system interacting with external fields (particles). They can be computed from measurements of the system-mediated coupling strengths between subspaces of incoming and outgoing fields (particles) that transform in a definite way under the symmetry. The generality of these symmetry breaking measures and their tight connection to experimental measurements make them applicable to a very wide range of physics, like quantification of phase transitions, constraints in dynamical evolution, and the search for hidden symmetries.",2017-11-16T08:33:27Z,2019-01-22T11:56:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07347v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07347v2,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP, physics.optics"
Multilevel Bayesian Parameter Estimation in the Presence of Model   Inadequacy and Data Uncertainty,Amir Shahmoradi,"Model inadequacy and measurement uncertainty are two of the most confounding aspects of inference and prediction in quantitative sciences. The process of scientific inference (the inverse problem) and prediction (the forward problem) involve multiple steps of data analysis, hypothesis formation, model construction, parameter estimation, model validation, and finally, the prediction of the quantity of interest. This article seeks to clarify the concepts of model inadequacy and bias, measurement uncertainty, and the two traditional classes of uncertainty: aleatoric versus epistemic, as well as their relationships with each other in the process of scientific inference. Starting from basic principles of probability, we build and explain a hierarchical Bayesian framework to quantitatively deal with model inadequacy and noise in data. The methodology can be readily applied to many common inference and prediction problems in science, engineering, and statistics.",2017-11-28T22:55:35Z,2017-11-28T22:55:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10599v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10599v1,"physics.data-an, astro-ph.IM, math.PR, physics.bio-ph, physics.med-ph"
QSMGAN: Improved Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping using 3D Generative   Adversarial Networks with Increased Receptive Field,"Yicheng Chen, Angela Jakary, Sivakami Avadiappan, Christopher P. Hess, Janine M. Lupo","Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a powerful MRI technique that has shown great potential in quantifying tissue susceptibility in numerous neurological disorders. However, the intrinsic ill-posed dipole inversion problem greatly affects the accuracy of the susceptibility map. We propose QSMGAN: a 3D deep convolutional neural network approach based on a 3D U-Net architecture with increased receptive field of the input phase compared to the output and further refined the network using the WGAN with gradient penalty training strategy. Our method generates accurate QSM maps from single orientation phase maps efficiently and performs significantly better than traditional non-learning-based dipole inversion algorithms.

Interpreting Adversarially Trained Convolutional Neural Networks,"Tianyuan Zhang, Zhanxing Zhu","We attempt to interpret how adversarially trained convolutional neural networks (AT-CNNs) recognize objects. We design systematic approaches to interpret AT-CNNs in both qualitative and quantitative ways and compare them with normally trained models. Surprisingly, we find that adversarial training alleviates the texture bias of standard CNNs when trained on object recognition tasks, and helps CNNs learn a more shape-biased representation. We validate our hypothesis from two aspects. First, we compare the salience maps of AT-CNNs and standard CNNs on clean images and images under different transformations. The comparison could visually show that the prediction of the two types of CNNs is sensitive to dramatically different types of features. Second, to achieve quantitative verification, we construct additional test datasets that destroy either textures or shapes, such as style-transferred version of clean data, saturated images and patch-shuffled ones, and then evaluate the classification accuracy of AT-CNNs and normal CNNs on these datasets. Our findings shed some light on why AT-CNNs are more robust than those normally trained ones and contribute to a better understanding of adversarial training over CNNs from an interpretation perspective.",2019-05-23T17:40:41Z,2019-05-23T17:40:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09797v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09797v1,"cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML"
Semi-Quantitative Abstraction and Analysis of Chemical Reaction Networks,"Milan Češka, Jan Křetínský","Analysis of large continuous-time stochastic systems is a computationally intensive task. In this work we focus on population models arising from chemical reaction networks (CRNs), which play a fundamental role in analysis and design of biochemical systems. Many relevant CRNs are particularly challenging for existing techniques due to complex dynamics including stochasticity, stiffness or multimodal population distributions. We propose a novel approach allowing not only to predict, but also to explain both the transient and steady-state behaviour. It focuses on qualitative description of the behaviour and aims at quantitative precision only in orders of magnitude. Firstly, we abstract the CRN into a compact model preserving rough timing information, distinguishing only signifcinatly different populations, but capturing relevant sequences of behaviour. Secondly, we approximately analyse the most probable temporal behaviours of the model through most probable transitions. As demonstrated on complex CRNs from literature, our approach reproduces the known results, but in contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, it runs with virtually no computational cost and thus offers unprecedented~scalability.",2019-05-23T20:44:39Z,2019-05-23T20:44:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09914v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09914v1,"cs.SY, cs.PF, q-bio.MN"
Optimal localization patterns in bacterial protein synthesis,"Jacky Nguyen, Michele Castellana","In $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ bacterium, the molecular compounds involved in protein synthesis, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and ribosomes, show marked intracellular localization patterns. Yet a quantitative understanding of the physical principles which would allow one to control protein synthesis by designing, bioengineering, and optimizing these localization patterns is still lacking. In this study, we consider a scenario where a synthetic modification of mRNA reaction-diffusion properties allows for controlling the localization and stoichiometry of mRNAs and polysomes$\mathrm{-}$complexes of multiple ribosomes bound to mRNAs. Our analysis demonstrates that protein synthesis can be controlled, e.g., optimally enhanced or inhibited, by leveraging mRNA spatial localization and stoichiometry only, without resorting to alterations of mRNA expression levels. We identify the physical mechanisms that control the protein-synthesis rate, highlighting the importance of colocalization between mRNAs and freely diffusing ribosomes, and the interplay between polysome stoichiometry and excluded-volume effects due to the DNA nucleoid. The genome-wide, quantitative predictions of our work may allow for a direct verification and implementation in cell-biology experiments, where localization patterns and protein-synthesis rates may be monitored by fluorescence microscopy in single cells and populations.",2019-05-25T19:22:35Z,2019-05-25T19:22:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10662v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10662v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.SC"
Fair Regression: Quantitative Definitions and Reduction-based Algorithms,"Alekh Agarwal, Miroslav Dudík, Zhiwei Steven Wu","In this paper, we study the prediction of a real-valued target, such as a risk score or recidivism rate, while guaranteeing a quantitative notion of fairness with respect to a protected attribute such as gender or race. We call this class of problems \emph{fair regression}. We propose general schemes for fair regression under two notions of fairness: (1) statistical parity, which asks that the prediction be statistically independent of the protected attribute, and (2) bounded group loss, which asks that the prediction error restricted to any protected group remain below some pre-determined level. While we only study these two notions of fairness, our schemes are applicable to arbitrary Lipschitz-continuous losses, and so they encompass least-squares regression, logistic regression, quantile regression, and many other tasks. Our schemes only require access to standard risk minimization algorithms (such as standard classification or least-squares regression) while providing theoretical guarantees on the optimality and fairness of the obtained solutions. In addition to analyzing theoretical properties of our schemes, we empirically demonstrate their ability to uncover fairness--accuracy frontiers on several standard datasets.",2019-05-30T03:39:02Z,2019-05-30T03:39:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12843v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12843v1,"cs.LG, stat.ML"
Energy Landscape and Metastability of Stochastic Ising and Potts Models   on Three-dimensional Lattices Without External Fields,"Seonwoo Kim, Insuk Seo","In this study, we investigate the energy landscape of the Ising and Potts models on fixed and finite but large three-dimensional (3D) lattices where no external field exists and quantitatively characterize the metastable behavior of the associated Glauber dynamics in the very low temperature regime. Such analyses for the models with non-zero external magnetic fields have been extensively performed over the past two decades; however, models without external fields remained uninvestigated. Recently, the corresponding investigation has been conducted for the two-dimensional (2D) model without an external field, and in this study, we further extend these successes to the 3D model, which has a far more complicated energy landscape than the 2D one. In particular, we provide a detailed description of the highly complex plateau structure of saddle configurations between ground states and then analyze the typical behavior of the Glauber dynamics thereon. Thus, we acheive a quantitatively precise analysis of metastability, including the Eyring-Kramers law, the Markov chain model reduction, and a full characterization of metastable transition paths.",2021-02-10T16:53:15Z,2023-01-04T08:19:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05565v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05565v3,"math.PR, math-ph, math.MP, 60J28 (Primary) 60K35, 82C22 (Secondary)"
HNPE: Leveraging Global Parameters for Neural Posterior Estimation,"Pedro L. C. Rodrigues, Thomas Moreau, Gilles Louppe, Alexandre Gramfort","Inferring the parameters of a stochastic model based on experimental observations is central to the scientific method. A particularly challenging setting is when the model is strongly indeterminate, i.e. when distinct sets of parameters yield identical observations. This arises in many practical situations, such as when inferring the distance and power of a radio source (is the source close and weak or far and strong?) or when estimating the amplifier gain and underlying brain activity of an electrophysiological experiment. In this work, we present hierarchical neural posterior estimation (HNPE), a novel method for cracking such indeterminacy by exploiting additional information conveyed by an auxiliary set of observations sharing global parameters. Our method extends recent developments in simulation-based inference (SBI) based on normalizing flows to Bayesian hierarchical models. We validate quantitatively our proposal on a motivating example amenable to analytical solutions and then apply it to invert a well known non-linear model from computational neuroscience, using both simulated and real EEG data.",2021-02-12T12:23:13Z,2021-11-09T18:25:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06477v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06477v3,"stat.ML, cs.LG, q-bio.QM"

Quantitative approximation results for complex-valued neural networks,"A. Caragea, D. G. Lee, J. Maly, G. Pfander, F.

It was recently observed, however, that complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) exhibit superior performance in applications in which the input is naturally complex-valued, such as MRI fingerprinting. While the mathematical theory of real-valued networks has, by now, reached some level of maturity, this is far from true for complex-valued networks. In this paper, we analyze the expressivity of complex-valued networks by providing explicit quantitative error bounds for approximating $C^n$ functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}^d$ by complex-valued neural networks that employ the modReLU activation function, given by $\sigma(z) = \mathrm{ReLU}(|z| - 1) \, \mathrm{sgn} (z)$, which is one of the most popular complex activation functions used in practice.

A canonical way to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data are deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have been typically limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of the model likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article provides a consistent estimator for the likelihood that is both computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, a deep belief network which has been suggested for the modeling of natural image patches is quantitatively investigated and compared to other models of natural image patches.

A characterization of the transient quantitative results is a novel aspect of our work. Three distinct regimes, namely, non-bouncing, complete bouncing and partial bouncing are presented. A critical pitch as well as impact velocity exists for the transition from one regime to another. This is explained with a demonstration of Cassie to Wenzel wetting transition in which the liquid penetrates in the grooves between the pillars at larger pitch or impact velocity.

However, a plethora of biological systems exhibit the counter-intuitive phenomenon of catch bonding, where non-covalent bonds become stronger under externally applied forces. The quest to understand the origin of catch-bond behavior has lead to the development of phenomenological and microscopic theories that can quantitatively recapitulate experimental data. Here, we assess the successes and limitations of such theories in explaining experimental data. The most widely applied approach is a phenomenological two-state model, which fits all of the available data on a variety of complexes: actomyosin, kinetochore-microtubule, selectin-ligand, and cadherin-catenin binding to filamentous actin. With a primary focus on the selectin family of cell-adhesion complexes, we discuss the positives and negatives of phenomenological models and the importance of evaluating the physical relevance of fitting parameters. We describe a microscopic theory for selectins, which provides a structural basis for catch bonds and predicts a crucial allosteric role for residues Asn82--Glu88.

If policy and frame position are mathematically related so that frame position increases more slowly as the policy becomes more extreme, majority formation at the extreme is favored, thereby shifting consensus formation toward the extreme. Additionally, use of a heuristic frame can shift the frame reference point away from the policy reference, yielding differential polarization on opposing policy sides.

Under the further assumption that $\Omega$ satisfies an interior Corkscrew condition, and combined with our previous work, and with recent work of Azzam, Mourgoglou and Tolsa, this yields a geometric characterization of domains whose harmonic measure is quantitatively absolutely continuous with respect to surface measure and hence a haracterization of the fact that the associated $L^p$-Dirichlet problem is solvable for some finite $p$.",2017-12-11T09:52:24Z,2018-07-09T17:13:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03696v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03696v3,"math.CA, math.AP, 31B05, 35J25, 42B25, 42B37"

However, it is still challenging to quantitatively calculate this many-electron effect, particularly at the low doping density that is most relevant to realistic experiments and devices. Here we develop a first-principles-based effective-mass model within the GW approximation and show a dramatic band gap renormalization of a few hundred meV for typical 2D semiconductors. Moreover, we reveal the roles of different many-electron interactions: The Coulomb-hole contribution is dominant for low doping densities while the screened-exchange contribution is dominant for high doping densities. Three prototypical 2D materials are studied by this method, h-BN, MoS2, and black phosphorus, covering insulators to semiconductors.

Experimental design trade-offs for gene regulatory network inference: an   in silico study of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle,"Johan Markdahl, Nicolo Colombo, Johan Thunberg, Jorge Goncalves","Time-series of high throughput gene sequencing data intended for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference are often short due to the high costs of sampling cell systems. Moreover, experimentalists lack a set of quantitative guidelines that prescribe the minimal number of samples required to infer a reliable GRN model. We study the temporal resolution of data vs quality of GRN inference in order to ultimately overcome this deficit. The evolution of a Markovian jump process model for the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway of proteins and metabolites in the G1 phase of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle is sampled at a number of different rates. For each time-series we infer a linear regression model of the GRN using the LASSO method. The inferred network topology is evaluated in terms of the area under the precision-recall curve AUPR. By plotting the AUPR against the number of samples, we show that the trade-off has a, roughly speaking, sigmoid shape. An optimal number of samples corresponds to values on the ridge of the sigmoid.",2017-12-14T20:55:51Z,2017-12-14T20:55:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05453v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05453v1,"q-bio.QM, math.OC"
Deep generative models of genetic variation capture mutation effects,"Adam J. Riesselman, John B. Ingraham, Debora S. Marks","The functions of proteins and RNAs are determined by a myriad of interactions between their constituent residues, but most quantitative models of how molecular phenotype depends on genotype must approximate this by simple additive effects. While recent models have relaxed this constraint to also account for pairwise interactions, these approaches do not provide a tractable path towards modeling higher-order dependencies. Here, we show how latent variable models with nonlinear dependencies can be applied to capture beyond-pairwise constraints in biomolecules. We present a new probabilistic model for sequence families, DeepSequence, that can predict the effects of mutations across a variety of deep mutational scanning experiments significantly better than site independent or pairwise models that are based on the same evolutionary data. The model, learned in an unsupervised manner solely from sequence information, is grounded with biologically motivated priors, reveals latent organization of sequence families, and can be used to extrapolate to new parts of sequence space",2017-12-18T17:13:08Z,2017-12-18T17:13:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06527v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06527v1,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.bio-ph, stat.ML"
A proposal for a quantitative indicator of original research output,Roberto Onofrio,"The use of quantitative indicators of scientific productivity seems now quite widespread for assessing researchers and research institutions. There is a general perception, however, that these indicators are not necessarily representative of the originality of the research carried out, being primarily indicative of a more or less prolific scientific activity and of the size of the targeted scientific subcommunity. We first discuss some of the drawbacks of the broadly adopted $h$-index and of the fact that it represents, in an average sense, an indicator derivable from the total number of citations. Then we propose an indicator which, although not immune from biases, seems more in line with the general expectations for quantifying what is typically considered original work. Qualitative arguments on how different indicators may shape the future of science are finally discussed.",2017-12-22T08:31:57Z,2017-12-22T08:31:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08337v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08337v1,"physics.soc-ph, cs.DL"

As a consequence, we prove that there exists a semi-algebraic path starting at $x$ and entering in $S$, such that the degree of the Zariski closure of the image of this path is bounded by $O(d)^{4k+3}$, improving a result of Jelonek and Kurdyka.

Here we provide a quantative convergence analysis for the solutions of the corresponding discretized Monge-Amp\`ere equations. This yields L^{2}-converge rates, in terms of the corresponding spatial resolution h, of the discrete approximations of the optimal transport map, when the source measure is discretized and the target measure has bounded convex support.

Here we demonstrate how to directly measure the inelastic momentum transfer of surface plasmon modes via the energy-loss filtered deflection of a focused electron beam in a transmission electron microscope. By scanning the beam over the sample we obtain a spatially and spectrally resolved deflection map and we further show how this deflection is related quantitatively to the spectral component of the induced electric and magnetic fields pertaining to the mode.

Using this framework, we provide an upper bound for $\sigma$ in the {\it Escherichia coli} chromosome, consistent with plasmid values, and offer a proof of concept for a high accuracy measurement. To reach these conclusions, we revisit the problem of the formation of ParB clusters.

The Synthesizability of Molecules Proposed by Generative Models,"Wenhao Gao, Connor W. Coley","The discovery of functional molecules is an expensive and time-consuming process, exemplified by the rising costs of small molecule therapeutic discovery. One class of techniques of growing interest for early-stage drug discovery is de novo molecular generation and optimization, catalyzed by the development of new deep learning approaches. These techniques can suggest novel molecular structures intended to maximize a multi-objective function, e.g., suitability as a therapeutic against a particular target, without relying on brute-force exploration of a chemical space. However, the utility of these approaches is stymied by ignorance of synthesizability. To highlight the severity of this issue, we use a data-driven computer-aided synthesis planning program to quantify how often molecules proposed by state-of-the-art generative models cannot be readily synthesized. Our analysis demonstrates that there are several tasks for which these models generate unrealistic molecular structures despite performing well on popular quantitative benchmarks. Synthetic complexity heuristics can successfully bias generation toward synthetically-tractable chemical space, although doing so necessarily detracts from the primary objective. This analysis suggests that to improve the utility of these models in real discovery workflows, new algorithm development is warranted.",2020-02-17T15:41:28Z,2020-02-17T15:41:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07007v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07007v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.LG, stat.ML"

Results: In this paper, we proposed a Network Embedding framework in Multiplex Networks (NEMN) to predict synthetic drug combinations. Based on a multiplex drug similarity network, we offered alternative methods to integrate useful information from different aspects and to decide quantitative importance of each network. To explain the feasibility of NEMN, we applied our framework to the data of drug-drug interactions, on which it showed better performance in terms of AUPR and ROC.

Extending an idea from [Gigli, On H\""older continuity-in-time of the optimal transport map towards measures along a curve], we characterize how transport plans change under perturbation of both $\mu$ and $\nu$. We apply this insight to prove error estimates for semi-discrete and fully-discrete algorithms in terms of errors solely arising from approximating measures. We obtain weighted $L^2$ error estimates for both types of algorithms with a convergence rate $O(h^{1/2})$. This coincides with the rate in [Berman, Convergence rates for discretized Monge--Amp\`ere equations and quantitative stability of Optimal Transport, Theorem 5.4] for semi-discrete methods, but the error notion is different.",2020-04-11T03:55:09Z,2020-04-11T03:55:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05299v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05299v1,"math.NA, cs.NA, 65N15, 65N12 (Primary) 35J96, 49Q22 (Secondary)"

In this work, we propose a novel architectural element, the Neural Status Register (NSR), for quantitative reasoning over numbers. Our NSR relaxes the discrete bit logic of physical status registers to continuous numbers and allows end-to-end learning with gradient descent.

Our theory provides a quantitative definition of downward causation, and introduces a complementary modality of emergent behaviour -- which we refer to as causal decoupling.

As an example we construct discrete random walks on an irrational lattice on the torus $\mathbb{R}^d/\mathbb{Z}^d$, and find their precise rate of convergence to uniformity in the $p$-Wasserstein metric. The proof uses a new Berry--Esseen type inequality for the $p$-Wasserstein metric on the torus, and the simultaneous Diophantine approximation properties of the lattice.

Therefore, the target values of system dependability characteristics are taken as requirements, while the actual value of a specific system design are provided by quantitative and qualitative dependability analysis (FHA, FMEA, FMEDA, of CFT-based FTA).

However, reaching quantitative accuracy using nonorthogonal multireference expansions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first rigorous perturbative correction to nonorthogonal configuration interaction, allowing the remaining dynamic correlation to be reliably computed. Our second-order ""NOCI-PT2"" theory exploits a zeroth-order generalised Fock Hamiltonian and builds the first-order interacting space using single and double excitations from each reference determinant. This approach therefore defines the rigorous nonorthogonal extension to conventional multireference perturbation theory.

Slack Reactants: A State-Space Truncation Framework to Estimate   Quantitative Behavior of the Chemical Master Equation,"Jinsu Kim, Jason Dark, German Enciso, Suzanne Sindi","State space truncation methods are widely used to approximate solutions of the chemical master equation. While most methods of this kind focus on truncating the state space directly, in this work we propose modifying the underlying chemical reaction network by introducing \emph{slack reactants} that indirectly truncate the state space. More specifically, slack reactants introduce an expanded chemical reaction network and impose a truncation scheme based on user defined properties, such as mass-conservation. This network structure allows us to prove inheritance of special properties of the original model, such as irreducibility and complex balancing.   We use the network structure imposed by slack reactants to prove the convergence of the stationary distribution and first arrival times. We then provide examples comparing our method with the stationary finite state projection and finite buffer methods.

The solution has been known to be the characteristic function of a centered ball, but this article aims at proving a sharp growth rate of the following form: if $V^*$ is a minimizer, then $\lambda(V)-\lambda(V^*)\geq C ||V-V^*||_{L^1(\Omega)}^2$ for some $C>0$. The proof relies on two notions of derivatives for shape optimization: parametric derivatives and shape derivatives. We use parametric derivatives to handle radial competitors, and shape derivatives to deal with normal deformation of the ball.

Kevrekidis","Following the highly restrictive measures adopted by many countries for combating the current pandemic, the number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated number of deaths is steadily decreasing. This fact, together with the impossibility of maintaining the lockdown indefinitely, raises the crucial question of whether it is possible to design an exit strategy based on quantitative analysis. Guided by rigorous mathematical results, we show that this is indeed possible: we present a robust numerical algorithm which can compute the cumulative number of deaths that will occur as a result of increasing the number of contacts by a given multiple, using as input only the most reliable of all data available during the lockdown, namely the cumulative number of deaths.",2020-05-27T22:54:50Z,2020-08-03T11:12:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13698v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13698v3,"q-bio.PE, physics.soc-ph"
Quantitative Alexandrov theorem and asymptotic behavior of the volume   preserving mean curvature flow,"Vesa Julin, Joonas Niinikoski","We prove a new quantitative version of the Alexandrov theorem which states that if the mean curvature of a regular set in R^{n+1} is close to a constant in L^{n}-sense, then the set is close to a union of disjoint balls with respect to the Hausdorff distance. This result is more general than the previous quantifications of the Alexandrov theorem and using it we are able to show that in R^2 and R^3 a weak solution of the volume preserving mean curvature flow starting from a set of finite perimeter asymptotically convergences to a disjoint union of equisize balls, up to possible translations.

Here, we automate feature extraction of time-lapse microscopy of human embryos with a machine-learning pipeline of five convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

A no-gold-standard technique to objectively evaluate quantitative   imaging methods using patient data: Theory,"Jinxin Liu, Ziping Liu, Joyce Mhlanga, Barry A. Siegel, Abhinav K. Jha","Objective evaluation of quantitative imaging (QI) methods using measurements directly obtained from patient images is highly desirable but hindered by the non-availability of gold standards. To address this issue, statistical techniques have been proposed to objectively evaluate QI methods without a gold standard. These techniques assume that the measured and true values are linearly related by a slope, bias, and normally distributed noise term, where it is assumed that the noise term between the different methods is independent. However, the noise could be correlated since it arises in the process of measuring the same true value. To address this issue, we propose a new no-gold-standard evaluation (NGSE) technique that models this noise as a multivariate normally distributed term, characterized by a covariance matrix. In this manuscript, we derive a maximum-likelihood-based technique that, without any knowledge of the true QI values, estimates the slope, bias, and covariance matrix terms. These are then used to rank the methods on the basis of precision of the measured QI values. Overall, the derivation demonstrates the mathematical premise behind the proposed NGSE technique.",2020-06-03T14:20:32Z,2020-06-03T14:20:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02290v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02290v1,"stat.ME, physics.med-ph"
How initial distribution affects symmetry breaking induced by panic in   ants: experiment and flee-pheromone model,"Geng Li, Weijia Wang, Jiahui Lin, Zhiyang Huang, Jianqiang Liang, Huabo Wu, Jianping Wen, Zengru Di, Bertrand Roehner, Zhangang Han","Collective escaping is a ubiquitous phenomenon in animal groups. Symmetry breaking caused by panic escape exhibits a shared feature across species that one exit is used more than the other when agents escaping from a closed space with two symmetrically located exists. Intuitively, one exit will be used more by more individuals close to it, namely there is an asymmetric distribution initially. We used ant groups to investigate how initial distribution of colonies would influence symmetry breaking in collective escaping. Surprisingly, there was no positive correlation between symmetry breaking and the asymmetrically initial distribution, which was quite counter-intuitive. In the experiments, a flee stage was observed and accordingly a flee-pheromone model was introduced to depict this special behavior in the early stage of escaping. Simulation results fitted well with the experiment. Furthermore, the flee stage duration was calibrated quantitatively and the model reproduced the observation demonstrated by our previous work.

Optical polarization analogue in free electrons beams,"Hugo Lourenço-Martins, Davy Gérard, Mathieu Kociak","Fast electrons spectromicroscopies enable to measure quantitatively the optical response of excitations with unrivaled spatial resolution. However, due to their inherently scalar nature, electron waves cannot access to polarization-related quantities. In spite of promising attempts based on the conversion of concepts originating from singular optics (such as vortex beams), the definition of an optical polarization analogue for fast electrons has remained a dead letter. Here, we establish such an analogue as the dipole transition vector of the electron between two well-chosen singular wave states. We show that electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) allows a direct measurement of the \textit{polarized} electromagnetic local density of states. In particular, in the case of circular polarization, it measures directly the local optical spin density. This work establishes EELS as a quantitative technique to tackle fundamental issues in nano-optics, such as super-chirality, the local polarization of dark excitations or polarization singularities at the nanoscale.",2020-06-11T09:44:01Z,2020-06-11T09:44:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06284v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06284v1,"physics.optics, cond-mat.other, physics.ins-det"
A Quantitative Assessment of Communicating Extra-Terrestrial Intelligent   Civilizations in the Galaxy and the Case of FRB-like Signals,Bing Zhang,A formula is proposed to quantitatively estimate the signal emission rate of Communicating Extra-Terrestrial Intelligent civilizations (CETIs) in the Galaxy.

A dedicated search for FRB-like artificial signals in the Galaxy for decades may pose a meaningful upper limit on the emission rate of these signals by CETIs. The Fermi-Hart paradox is answered in terms of not having enough observing times for this and other types of signals.

To generate cell features at different resolutions and scale to high-resolution images, we develop a novel multi-scale flow architecture based on a Haar wavelet image pyramid. To maximize the mutual information between the generated images and the molecular interventions, we devise a training strategy based on contrastive learning.

In particular, we derive explicit expressions for the local and global Lipschitz constants of the solution map of non-convex or convex optimization problems, respectively. Our results are geared towards the study of time-varying optimization problems which are commonplace in various applications of online optimization, including power systems, robotics, signal processing and more. In this context, our results can be used to bound the rate of change of the optimizer. To illustrate the use of our sensitivity bounds we generalize existing arguments to quantify the tracking performance of continuous-time, monotone running algorithms. Further, we introduce a new continuous-time running algorithm for time-varying constrained optimization which we model as a so-called perturbed sweeping process. For this discontinuous scheme, we establish an explicit bound on the asymptotic solution tracking for a class of convex problems.",2020-06-18T17:25:10Z,2020-06-18T17:25:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10693v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10693v1,"math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Coded aperture correlation holographic microscope for single-shot   quantitative phase imaging with extended field of view,"Nathaniel Hai, Joseph Rosen","Recently, a method of recording holograms of coherently illuminated three-dimensional scene without two-wave interference was demonstrated. The method is an extension of the coded aperture correlation holography from incoherent to coherent illumination. Although this method is practical for some tasks, it is not capable of imaging phase objects, a capability that is an important benefit of coherent holography. The present work addresses this limitation by using the same type of coded phase masks in a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We show that by several comparative parameters, the coded aperture-based phase imaging is superior to the equivalent open aperture-based method. As an additional merit of the coded aperture approach, a framework for increasing the system's field of view is formulated and demonstrated for both amplitude and phase objects. The combination of high sensitivity quantitative phase microscope with increased field of view in a single camera shot holographic apparatus, has immense potential to serve as the preferred tool for examination of biological tissues and micro-organisms.",2020-06-24T08:15:59Z,2020-06-24T08:15:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13549v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13549v1,"physics.optics, eess.IV"

This gives a quantitative answer to Schoen and Yau's question on the positive mass theorem with arbitrary ends for spin manifolds. Similar results have recently been obtained by Lesourd, Unger and Yau without the spin condition in dimensions $\leq 7$ assuming Schwarzschild asymptotics on the end $\mathcal{E}$. We also derive explicit quantitative distance estimates in case the scalar curvature is uniformly positive in some region of the chosen end $\mathcal{E}$.

Three-dimensional granular flow continuum modeling via material point   method with hyperelastic nonlocal granular fluidity,"Amin Haeri, Krzysztof Skonieczny","The accurate and efficient modeling of granular flows and their interactions with external bodies is an open research problem. Continuum methods can be used to capture complexities neglected by terramechanics models without the computational expense of discrete element methods. Constitutive models and numerical solvers are the two primary aspects of the continuum methods. The viscoplastic size-dependent non-local granular fluidity (NGF) constitutive model has successfully provided a quantitative description of experimental flows in many different configurations in literature. This research develops a numerical approach, within a hyperelasticity framework, for implementing the dynamical form of NGF in three-dimensional material point method (3D MPM, an appropriate numerical solver for granular flow modeling). This approach is thermodynamically consistent to conserve energy, and the dynamical form includes the nonlocal effect of flow cessation. Excavation data, both quantitative measurements and qualitative visualization, are collected experimentally via our robotic equipment to evaluate the model with respect to the flow geometry as well as interaction forces.

Here the phase lag is treated quantitatively from a multichannel coupling formulation, and our calculations based on multichannel quantum defect and $R$-matrix treatment achieves good agreement with the experimental observations.

Uniform Convergence Rates for Lipschitz Learning on Graphs,"Leon Bungert, Jeff Calder, Tim Roith","Lipschitz learning is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method where one extends labels from a labeled to an unlabeled data set by solving the infinity Laplace equation on a weighted graph. In this work we prove uniform convergence rates for solutions of the graph infinity Laplace equation as the number of vertices grows to infinity. Their continuum limits are absolutely minimizing Lipschitz extensions with respect to the geodesic metric of the domain where the graph vertices are sampled from. We work under very general assumptions on the graph weights, the set of labeled vertices, and the continuum domain. Our main contribution is that we obtain quantitative convergence rates even for very sparsely connected graphs, as they typically appear in applications like semi-supervised learning. In particular, our framework allows for graph bandwidths down to the connectivity radius. For proving this we first show a quantitative convergence statement for graph distance functions to geodesic distance functions in the continuum. Using the ""comparison with distance functions"" principle, we can pass these convergence statements to infinity harmonic functions and absolutely minimizing Lipschitz extensions.",2021-11-24T09:44:14Z,2022-06-29T15:42:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12370v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12370v2,"math.NA, cs.LG, cs.NA, math.AP, 35J20, 35R02, 65N12, 68T05"

There is considerable interest in maximising the degree of switching, and in measuring this degree during illumination in complex environments. We study the switching of photoresponsive lipid membranes that allow precise and reversible manipulation of membrane shape, permeability, and fluidity. Though these macroscopic photoresponses are clear, it is unclear how large the changes of trans/cis ratio are, and whether they can be improved. Here, we used small-angle X-ray scattering to measure the thickness of photoswitchable lipid membranes, and correlate thickness to trans/cis ratios. This revealed an unexpected dependency of photoswitching upon aqueous phase composition, highlighting smaller-than-expected photoswitching with deionized water, and showed thickness variations twice as large as previously observed.

Modifications of CMB spectrum by nonextensive statistical mechanics,Yang Liu,"Cosmic microwave background radiation can supply us some most significant parts of the information on the universe. Some researchers believe that The gravitational system cannot be decribed by the standard statistical mechanics. In this article we apply Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics to investigate CMB spectrum and related cosmological processes. Based on recent observational data we find that the nonextensive statistical mechanics can modify the values of related physical quantites. Since the value of physical quantites have changed, some processes, such as recombination, can be affected. We have investigated the anisotropy of the CMB for two effects: the dipole anisotropy of CMB and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find that the dipole anisotropy of CMB cannot be modified by the nonextensive statistical mechanics.

Stability Based Generalization Bounds for Exponential Family Langevin   Dynamics,"Arindam Banerjee, Tiancong Chen, Xinyan Li, Yingxue Zhou","Recent years have seen advances in generalization bounds for noisy stochastic algorithms, especially stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) based on stability (Mou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020) and information theoretic approaches (Xu and Raginsky, 2017; Negrea et al., 2019; Steinke and Zakynthinou, 2020). In this paper, we unify and substantially generalize stability based generalization bounds and make three technical contributions. First, we bound the generalization error in terms of expected (not uniform) stability which arguably leads to quantitatively sharper bounds. Second, as our main contribution, we introduce Exponential Family Langevin Dynamics (EFLD), a substantial generalization of SGLD, which includes noisy versions of Sign-SGD and quantized SGD as special cases. We establish data-dependent expected stability based generalization bounds for any EFLD algorithm with a O(1/n) sample dependence and dependence on gradient discrepancy rather than the norm of gradients, yielding significantly sharper bounds. Third, we establish optimization guarantees for special cases of EFLD.

In this work, we investigate the emerging dynamics of particles anchored through ligand-receptor bridges to functionalized surfaces. We consider systems with reversible bridges in which ligand-receptor pairs bind/unbind with finite reaction rates. For a given set of bridges, the particle can explore a tiny fraction of the surface as the extensivity of the bridges is finite. We show how at time scales longer than the bridges' lifetime, the averaged position of the particle diffuses away from its initial value. We distill our findings into two analytic equations for the sliding diffusion constant of particles carrying mobile and fixed ligands.

Quantitative coarse-graining of Markov chains,"Bastian Hilder, Upanshu Sharma","Coarse-graining techniques play a central role in reducing the complexity of stochastic models, and are typically characterised by a mapping which projects the full state of the system onto a smaller set of variables which captures the essential features of the system. Starting with a continuous-time Markov chain, in this work we propose and analyse an effective dynamics, which approximates the dynamical information in the coarse-grained chain. Without assuming explicit scale-separation, we provide sufficient conditions under which this effective dynamics stays close to the original system and provide quantitative bounds on the approximation error. We also compare the effective dynamics and corresponding error bounds to the averaging literature on Markov chains which involve explicit scale-separation. We demonstrate our findings on an illustrative test example.",2022-01-25T11:54:54Z,2023-09-27T00:46:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10256v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10256v2,"math.PR, math.CA, math.DS, 34C29, 34E13, 39B62, 60B10, 60J27, 60J28"
Reflective obstructions of unitary modular varieties,Yota Maeda,"To prove that a modular variety is of general type, there are three types of obstructions: reflective, cusp and elliptic obstructions. In this paper, we give a quantitative estimate of the reflective obstructions for the unitary case. This shows in particular that the reflective obstructions are small enough in higher dimension, say greater than $138$. Our result reduces the study of the Kodaira dimension of unitary modular varieties to the construction of a cusp form of small weight in a quantitative manner. As a byproduct, we formulate and partially prove the finiteness of Hermitian lattices admitting reflective modular forms, which is a unitary analog of the conjecture by Gritsenko-Nikulin in the orthogonal case.

Transfinite Modal Logic: a Semi-quantitative Explanation for Bayesian   Reasoning,Xinyu Wang,"Bayesian reasoning plays a significant role both in human rationality and in machine learning. In this paper, we introduce transfinite modal logic, which combines modal logic with ordinal arithmetic, in order to formalize Bayesian reasoning semi-quantitatively. Technically, we first investigate some nontrivial properties of ordinal arithmetic, which then enable us to expand normal modal logic's semantics naturally and elegantly onto the novel transfinite modal logic, while still keeping the ordinary definition of Kripke models totally intact. Despite all the transfinite mathematical definition, we argue that in practice, this logic can actually fit into a completely finite interpretation as well. We suggest that transfinite modal logic captures the essence of Bayesian reasoning in a rather clear and simple form, in particular, it provides a perfect explanation for Sherlock Holmes' famous saying, ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" We also prove a counterpart of finite model property theorem for our logic.",2022-04-02T17:58:14Z,2022-04-02T17:58:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03563v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03563v1,"cs.AI, cs.LO, math.LO"

The proof uses a construction of a doubling Frostman measure on a lower content regular set, which may be of independent interest. Our second main result is the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem for sets with plenty of big projections.

A Maximum Entropy Approach to Defining Cell State,Ashika-Sita Jayanthy,"The past few decades have seen great leaps in technologies to analyze cells and tissues. Omics methods in particular now allow us unprecedented access to their the molecular composition where the base-level resolution of transcripts and their numbers can be determined at a single cell level. Existing methods to analyze the resulting data make use of the count data while discarding the information present in the sequences themselves. In this paper we used a maximum entropy approach to develop a method to analyze RNA-seq data using both the sequence and count information. By mapping sequences to vectors of spins and defining an energy function on them, we were able to identify specific states in a biological process using mean energies and their associated Boltzmann-probabilities.

Although extensive studies have been performed to prolong the cycle life of Li metal batteries, the calendar life, which associates with chemical corrosion of Li metal in liquid electrolytes, has not been quantitatively understood. Here, by combing the Titration Gas Chromatography (TGC) method and Cryogenic Focused Ion Beam (Cryo-FIB), we established a quantitative relationship between the chemical corrosion rate and electrochemically deposited Li morphology in various liquid electrolyte systems. We identified that the corrosion rate is dominated by the porosity of the deposited Li. The larger the porosity of deposited Li has, the faster the corrosion rate will be. We further proposed strategies to mitigate the chemical corrosion on Li thus to extend the calendar life of Li metal batteries. By strictly controlling the stacking pressure during Li plating, Li deposits with ultra-low porosity can be achieved, suppressing the corrosion rate to 0.08% per day compared with 1.71% per day of the high-porosity Li.",2022-04-19T16:50:13Z,2022-04-19T16:50:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11631v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11631v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.chem-ph"

Bead based microfluidic sensors have been a popular modality due to the plug and play nature of analyte choice and the favorable geometry of spherical sensor scaffolds. While constriction of beads against fluid flow remains a popular method to immobilize the sensor, it results in poor fluidic regimes and shear conditions around sensor beads that can affect sensor performance. We present an alternative means of sensor bead immobilization using poly-carbonate membrane. This system results in several orders of magnitude lower variance of flow radially around the sensor bead. Shear stress experienced by our non-constrictive immobilized bead was three orders of magnitude lower.

Silberzan","Tissue fusion eliminates physical voids in a tissue to form a continuous structure and is central to many processes in development and repair. Fusion events in vivo, particularly in embryonic development, often involve the purse-string contraction of a pluricellular actomyosin cable at the free edge. However in vitro, adhesion of the cells to their substrate favors a closure mechanism mediated by lamellipodial protrusions, which has prevented a systematic study of the purse-string mechanism. Here, we show that monolayers can cover well-controlled mesoscopic non-adherent areas much larger than a cell size by purse-string closure and that active epithelial fluctuations are required for this process. We have formulated a simple stochastic model that includes purse-string contractility, tissue fluctuations and effective friction to qualitatively and quantitatively account for the dynamics of closure. Our data suggest that, in vivo, tissue fusion adapts to the local environment by coordinating lamellipodial protrusions and purse-string contractions.",2015-08-11T13:15:59Z,2015-08-11T13:15:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02582v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02582v1,"q-bio.TO, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM"

What can (partition) logic contribute to information theory?,David Ellerman,"Logical probability theory was developed as a quantitative measure based on Boole's logic of subsets. But information theory was developed into a mature theory by Claude Shannon with no such connection to logic. A recent development in logic changes this situation. In category theory, the notion of a subset is dual to the notion of a quotient set or partition, and recently the logic of partitions has been developed in a parallel relationship to the Boolean logic of subsets (subset logic is usually mis-specified as the special case of propositional logic). What then is the quantitative measure based on partition logic in the same sense that logical probability theory is based on subset logic? It is a measure of information that is named ""logical entropy"" in view of that logical basis. This paper develops the notion of logical entropy and the basic notions of the resulting logical information theory. Then an extensive comparison is made with the corresponding notions based on Shannon entropy.",2016-09-08T13:36:15Z,2017-03-25T04:35:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02422v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02422v2,"cs.IT, math.IT, 94A15, E.4"

We study the relation between recent events and past events and particularly focus on understanding memory triggering patterns. We devise a quantitative model that explains the flow of viewership from a current event to past events based on similarity in time, geography, topic, and the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia articles.

Improving landscape inference by integrating heterogeneous data in the   inverse Ising problem,"Pierre Barrat-Charlaix, Matteo Figliuzzi, Martin Weigt","The inverse Ising problem and its generalizations to Potts and continuous spin models have recently attracted much attention thanks to their successful applications in the statistical modeling of biological data. In the standard setting, the parameters of an Ising model (couplings and fields) are inferred using a sample of equilibrium configurations drawn from the Boltzmann distribution. However, in the context of biological applications, quantitative information for a limited number of microscopic spins configurations has recently become available. In this paper, we extend the usual setting of the inverse Ising model by developing an integrative approach combining the equilibrium sample with (possibly noisy) measurements of the energy performed for a number of arbitrary configurations. Using simulated data, we show that our integrative approach outperforms standard inference based only on the equilibrium sample or the energy measurements, including error correction of noisy energy measurements. As a biological proof-of-concept application, we show that mutational fitness landscapes in proteins can be better described when combining evolutionary sequence data with complementary structural information about mutant sequences.",2016-09-19T12:36:22Z,2016-11-05T12:27:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05692v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05692v2,"q-bio.QM, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech"
A Framework for Challenge Design: Insight and Deployment Challenges to   Address Medical Image Analysis Problems,"Adriënne M. Mendrik, Stephen R. Aylward","In this paper we aim to refine the concept of grand challenges in medical image analysis, based on statistical principles from quantitative and qualitative experimental research. We identify two types of challenges based on their generalization objective: 1) a deployment challenge and 2) an insight challenge. A deployment challenge's generalization objective is to find algorithms that solve a medical image analysis problem, which thereby requires the use of a quantitative experimental design. An insight challenge's generalization objective is to gain a broad understanding of what class of algorithms might be effective for a class of medical image analysis problems, in which case a qualitative experimental design is sufficient. Both challenge types are valuable, but problems arise when a challenge's design and objective are inconsistent, as is often the case when a challenge does not carefully consider these concepts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a theoretical framework, based on statistical principles, to guide researchers in challenge design, documentation, and assessment.

Improved motion correction for functional MRI using an omnibus   regression model,"Vyom Raval, Kevin P.

Previous approaches to suppress head motion artifacts have involved sequential regression of nuisance covariates, but this has been shown to reintroduce artifacts. We propose a new motion correction pipeline using an omnibus regression model that avoids this problem by simultaneously regressing out multiple artifacts using the best performing algorithms to estimate each artifact. We quantitatively evaluate its motion artifact suppression performance against sequential regression pipelines using a large heterogeneous dataset (n=151) which includes high-motion subjects and multiple disease phenotypes.

Directional motion of vibrated sessile drops : a quantitative study,"Maxime Costalonga, Philippe Brunet","The directional motion of sessile drops can be induced by slanted mechanical vibrations of the substrate. As previously evidenced \cite{Brunet07,Brunet09,Noblin09}, the mechanical vibrations induce drop deformations which combine axisymmetric and antisymmetric modes. In this paper, we establish quantitative trends from experiments conducted within a large range of parameters, namely the amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$ of the forcing, the liquid viscosity $\eta$ and the angle between the substrate and the forcing axis $\alpha$. These experiments are carried out on weak-pinning substrates. For most parameters sets, the averaged velocity $<v>$ grows linearly with $A$. We extract the mobility, defined as $s=\frac{\Delta <v>}{\Delta A}$. It is found that $s$ can show a sharp maximal value close to the resonance frequency of the first axisymmetric mode $f_p$. The value of $s$ tends to be almost independent on $\eta$ below 50 cSt, while $s$ decreases significantly for higher $\eta$. Also, it is found that for peculiar sets of parameters, particularly with $f$ far enough from $f_p$, the drop moves in the reverse direction. Finally, we draw a relationship between $<v>$ and the averaged values of the dynamical contact angles at both sides of the drop over one period of oscillation.",2020-01-03T20:12:14Z,2020-01-03T20:12:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00966v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00966v1,"physics.flu-dyn, cond-mat.soft"

Thus, D-optimal optimal designs for such multinomial logit models may comprise choice sets, e.g., consisting of alternatives which are identical in all discrete attributes but different in the quantitative variable. Obviously such designs are not appropriate for many empirical choice experiments. It will be shown that locally D-optimal designs for multinomial probit models supposing independent utilities consist of counterintuitive choice sets as well.

The segmentation networks were developed separately using US image and entropy maps, and evaluated on a test set of 81 breast masses. The attention U-Net trained based on entropy maps achieved average Dice score of 0.60 (median 0.71), while for the model trained using US images we obtained average Dice score of 0.53 (median 0.59).

Deep Learning in Mining Biological Data,"Mufti Mahmud, M Shamim Kaiser, Amir Hussain","Recent technological advancements in data acquisition tools allowed life scientists to acquire multimodal data from different biological application domains. Broadly categorized in three types (i.e., sequences, images, and signals), these data are huge in amount and complex in nature. Mining such an enormous amount of data for pattern recognition is a big challenge and requires sophisticated data-intensive machine learning techniques. Artificial neural network-based learning systems are well known for their pattern recognition capabilities and lately their deep architectures - known as deep learning (DL) - have been successfully applied to solve many complex pattern recognition problems. Highlighting the role of DL in recognizing patterns in biological data, this article provides - applications of DL to biological sequences, images, and signals data; overview of open access sources of these data; description of open source DL tools applicable on these data; and comparison of these tools from qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

Most Probable Dynamics of Stochastic Dynamical Systems with   Exponentially Light Jump Fluctuations,"Yang Li, Jinqiao Duan, Xianbin Liu, Yanxia Zhang","The emergence of the exit events from a bounded domain containing a stable fixed point induced by non-Gaussian L\'evy fluctuations plays a pivotal role in practical physical systems. In the limit of weak noise, we develop a Hamiltonian formalism under the L\'evy fluctuations with exponentially light jumps for one- and two-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems. This formalism is based on a recently proved large deviation principle for dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy perturbations. We demonstrate how to compute the most probable exit path and the quasi-potential by several examples. Meanwhile, we explore the impacts of the jump measure on the quasi-potential quantitatively and on the most probable exit path qualitatively. Results show that the quasi-potential can be well estimated by an approximate analytical expression. Moreover, we discover that although the most probable exit paths are analogous to the Gaussian case for the isotropic noise, the anisotropic noise leads to significant changes of the structure of the exit paths. These findings shed light on the underlying qualitative mechanism and quantitative feature of the exit phenomenon induced by non-Gaussian noise.",2020-03-01T01:40:21Z,2020-03-01T01:40:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00377v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00377v1,"math.ST, nlin.CD, stat.TH"
A Theory of Computational Resolution Limit for Line Spectral Estimation,"Ping Liu, Hai Zhang","Line spectral estimation is a classical signal processing problem that aims to estimate the line spectra from their signal which is contaminated by deterministic or random noise. Despite a large body of research on this subject, the theoretical understanding of this problem is still elusive. In this paper, we introduce and quantitatively characterize the two resolution limits for the line spectral estimation problem under deterministic noise: one is the minimum separation distance between the line spectra that is required for exact detection of their number, and the other is the minimum separation distance between the line spectra that is required for a stable recovery of their supports. The quantitative results imply a phase transition phenomenon in each of the two recovery problems, and also the subtle difference between the two. We further propose a sweeping singular-value-thresholding algorithm for the number detection problem and conduct numerical experiments. The numerical results confirm the phase transition phenomenon in the number detection problem.",2020-02-26T03:31:49Z,2020-10-14T06:33:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02917v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02917v2,"cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT"

Despite long-standing, multi-disciplinary interests in understanding careers of elite scientists, there have been limited attempts for a quantitative, career-level analysis. Here, we leverage a comprehensive dataset we assembled, allowing us to trace the entire career histories of nearly all Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine over the past century. We find that, although Nobel laureates were energetic producers from the outset, producing works that garner unusually high impact, their careers before winning the prize follow relatively similar patterns as ordinary scientists, being characterized by hot streaks and increasing reliance on collaborations. We also uncovered notable variations along their careers, often associated with the Nobel prize, including shifting coauthorship structure in the prize-winning work, and a significant but temporary dip in the impact of work they produce after winning the Nobel.

Optimising Lockdown Policies for Epidemic Control using Reinforcement   Learning,"Harshad Khadilkar, Tanuja Ganu, Deva P Seetharam","In the context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, several reports and studies have attempted to model and predict the spread of the disease. There is also intense debate about policies for limiting the damage, both to health and to the economy. On the one hand, the health and safety of the population is the principal consideration for most countries. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the potential for long-term economic damage caused by strict nation-wide lockdowns. In this working paper, we present a quantitative way to compute lockdown decisions for individual cities or regions, while balancing health and economic considerations. Furthermore, these policies are learnt automatically by the proposed algorithm, as a function of disease parameters (infectiousness, gestation period, duration of symptoms, probability of death) and population characteristics (density, movement propensity). We account for realistic considerations such as imperfect lockdowns, and show that the policy obtained using reinforcement learning is a viable quantitative approach towards lockdowns.",2020-03-31T11:04:18Z,2020-05-01T11:28:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14093v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14093v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.PE, stat.ML"
Estimating the infection horizon of COVID-19 in eight countries with a   data-driven approach,"G. D. Barmparis, G. P.

The strict disciplinary measures implemented by China were very effective and thus were subsequently adopted by most world countries to various degrees. The infection duration and number of infected persons are of critical importance for the battle against the pandemic. We use the quantitative landscape of the disease spreading in China as a benchmark and utilize infection data from eight countries to estimate the complete evolution of the infection in each of these countries. The analysis predicts successfully both the expected number of daily infections per country and, perhaps more importantly, the duration of the epidemic in each country. Our quantitative approach is based on a Gaussian spreading hypothesis that is shown to arise as a result of imposed measures in a simple dynamical infection model.

Design principles for the glycoprotein quality control pathway,"Aidan I Brown, Elena F Koslover","Newly-translated glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) often undergo cycles of chaperone binding and release in order to assist in folding. Quality control is required to distinguish between proteins that have completed native folding, those that have yet to fold, and those that have misfolded. Using quantitative modeling, we explore how the design of the quality-control pathway modulates its efficiency. Our results show that an energy-consuming cyclic quality-control process, similar to the observed physiological system, outperforms alternative designs. The kinetic parameters that optimize the performance of this system drastically change with protein production levels, while remaining relatively insensitive to the protein folding rate. Adjusting only the degradation rate, while fixing other parameters, allows the pathway to adapt across a range of protein production levels, aligning with in vivo measurements that implicate the release of degradation-associated enzymes as a rapid-response system for perturbations in protein homeostasis. The quantitative models developed here elucidate design principles for effective glycoprotein quality control in the ER, improving our mechanistic understanding of a system crucial to maintaining cellular health.",2020-08-12T23:27:32Z,2020-08-12T23:27:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05608v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05608v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio.SC"

This directional information is overlaid on standard grayscale blood flow images to depict flow moving towards the camera in red and flow moving away from the camera in blue, as in ultrasound color Doppler imaging. We show that thanks to the strong contribution of backscattering to the Doppler spectrum in out-of-plane vessels, the local axial direction of blood flow can be revealed with a high temporal resolution, which enables us to evidence pathological blood flow reversals.

We examine dune formation at the upwind margin of the White Sands Dune Field in New Mexico (USA), using 4 years of lidar topographic data to follow the spatial and temporal development of incipient dunes. Data quantify dune wavelength, growth rate, and propagation velocity and also the characteristic length scale associated with the growth process.

Autophagosome formation involves dynamic morphological changes; a disk-shaped membrane cisterna grows, bends to become a cup-shaped structure, and finally develops into a spherical autophagosome. We have constructed a theoretical model that integrates the membrane morphological change and entropic partitioning of putative curvature generators, which we have used to investigate the autophagosome formation process quantitatively. We show that the membrane curvature and the distribution of the curvature generators stabilize disk- and cup-shaped intermediate structures during autophagosome formation, which is quantitatively consistent with in vivo observations. These results suggest that various autophagy proteins with membrane curvature-sensing properties control morphological change by stabilizing these intermediate structures.

Globalization? Trade War? A Counterbalance Perspective,Xingwei Hu,"The embrace of globalization and protectionism among economies has ebbed and flowed over the past few decades. These fluctuations call for quantitative analytics to help countries improve their trade policies. Changing attitudes toward globalization also imply that the best trade policies vary over time and are country-specific. We argue that the imports and exports of all economies constitute a counterbalanced network where conflict and cooperation are two sides of the same coin. Quantitative competitiveness is then formulated for each country using a network counterbalance equilibrium. A country could improve its relative strength in the network by embracing globalization, protectionism, trade collaboration, or conflict. This paper presents some necessary conditions for globalization and trade wars, evaluates their side effects, derives national bargaining powers, identifies appropriate targets for conflict or collaboration, and recommends fair resolutions for trade conflicts.

We address here this aspect by developing a solid theoretical foundation for a spectroscopy of interaction times, i.e. the inference of interaction constants from imaging data. The non trivial crossover between a power law to an exponential behavior of the distribution of the interaction times is highlighted here, together with the dependence of the exponential term upon the product of the microscopic reaction rates (affinity).

Robust Phase Unwrapping via Deep Image Prior for Quantitative Phase   Imaging,"Fangshu Yang, Thanh-an Pham, Nathalie Brandenberg, Matthias P. Lutolf, Jianwei Ma, Michael Unser","Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is an emerging label-free technique that produces images containing morphological and dynamical information without contrast agents. Unfortunately, the phase is wrapped in most imaging system. Phase unwrapping is the computational process that recovers a more informative image. It is particularly challenging with thick and complex samples such as organoids. Recent works that rely on supervised training show that deep learning is a powerful method to unwrap the phase; however, supervised approaches require large and representative datasets which are difficult to obtain for complex biological samples. Inspired by the concept of deep image priors, we propose a deep-learning-based method that does not need any training set. Our framework relies on an untrained convolutional neural network to accurately unwrap the phase while ensuring the consistency of the measurements. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method faithfully recovers the phase of complex samples on both real and simulated data.

This rules out the possibility to have a quantitative version of the Luzin-Novikov theorem. The construction is a modification of the method of Harrington who invented it to show that there exists a countable $\Pi^0_1$ set in $\omega^\omega$ containing a non-arithmetic singleton.

Single-frame far-field diffractive imaging with randomized illumination,"Abraham L. Levitan, Kahraman Keskinbora, Umut T.

In RPI, a sample is illuminated by a structured probe field containing speckles smaller than the sample's typical feature size. Quantitative amplitude and phase images are then reconstructed from the resulting far-field diffraction pattern. The experimental geometry of RPI is straightforward to implement, requires no near-field optics, and is applicable to extended samples. When the resulting data are analyzed with a complimentary algorithm, reliable reconstructions which are robust to missing data are achieved. To realize these benefits, a resolution limit associated with the numerical aperture of the probe-forming optics is imposed. RPI therefore offers an attractive modality for quantitative X-ray phase imaging when temporal resolution and reliability are critical but spatial resolution in the tens of nanometers is sufficient. We discuss the method, introduce a reconstruction algorithm, and present two proof-of-concept experiments: one using visible light, and one using soft X-rays.",2020-10-06T18:00:52Z,2020-11-24T15:03:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02948v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02948v2,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, eess.IV"

Renson","This paper introduces a machine learning approach to take a nonlinear differential-equation model that exhibits qualitative agreement with a physical experiment over a range of parameter values and produce a hybrid model that also exhibits quantitative agreement. The underpinning idea is that the bifurcation experiment structure of an experiment can be revealed using techniques such as control-based continuation and then used to generate a simplified normal-form-like model. A machine learning approach is then used to learn a coordinate transform from the normal-form-like model to the physical coordinates of the experiment. This approach is demonstrated on a mathematical model of aero-elastic flutter, where good agreement at the level of the bifurcation diagrams is shown between the hybrid model and the underlying ground truth. Moreover, individual phase portraits and time series are also reproduced accurately, even in regions away from training data. As such, the approach holds significant promise for producing quantitatively accurate models that exhibit the correct nonlinear behaviour over a range of parameter values.",2020-11-03T22:26:26Z,2022-08-23T17:52:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02041v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02041v3,"math.DS, physics.flu-dyn"
Multiclass Yeast Segmentation in Microstructured Environments with Deep   Learning,"Tim Prangemeier, Christian Wildner, André O. Françani, Christoph Reich, Heinz Koeppl","Cell segmentation is a major bottleneck in extracting quantitative single-cell information from microscopy data. The challenge is exasperated in the setting of microstructured environments. While deep learning approaches have proven useful for general cell segmentation tasks, existing segmentation tools for the yeast-microstructure setting rely on traditional machine learning approaches. Here we present convolutional neural networks trained for multiclass segmenting of individual yeast cells and discerning these from cell-similar microstructures. We give an overview of the datasets recorded for training, validating and testing the networks, as well as a typical use-case. We showcase the method's contribution to segmenting yeast in microstructured environments with a typical synthetic biology application in mind. The models achieve robust segmentation results, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art in both accuracy and speed. The combination of fast and accurate segmentation is not only beneficial for a posteriori data processing, it also makes online monitoring of thousands of trapped cells or closed-loop optimal experimental design feasible from an image processing perspective.",2020-11-16T16:16:13Z,2020-11-19T14:28:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08062v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08062v2,"q-bio.QM, cs.CV, eess.IV, physics.ins-det"
An off-the-grid approach to multi-compartment magnetic resonance   fingerprinting,"Mohammad Golbabaee, Clarice Poon","We propose a novel numerical approach to separate multiple tissue compartments in image voxels and to estimate quantitatively their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties and mixture fractions, given magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) measurements. The number of tissues, their types or quantitative properties are not a-priori known, but the image is assumed to be composed of sparse compartments with linearly mixed Bloch magnetisation responses within voxels. Fine-grid discretisation of the multi-dimensional NMR properties creates large and highly coherent MRF dictionaries that can challenge scalability and precision of the numerical methods for (discrete) sparse approximation. To overcome these issues, we propose an off-the-grid approach equipped with an extended notion of the sparse group lasso regularisation for sparse approximation using continuous (non-discretised) Bloch response models. Further, the nonlinear and non-analytical Bloch responses are approximated by a neural network, enabling efficient back-propagation of the gradients through the proposed algorithm. Tested on simulated and in-vivo healthy brain MRF data, we demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the baseline multicompartment MRF methods.",2020-11-23T03:16:55Z,2020-11-23T03:16:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11193v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11193v1,"cs.CV, cs.NA, math.NA"
On the effectiveness of the European Central Bank's conventional and   unconventional policies under uncertainty,"Niko Hauzenberger, Michael Pfarrhofer, Anna Stelzer","In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) conditional on the prevailing level of uncertainty. To obtain exogenous variation in central bank policy, we rely on high-frequency surprises in financial market data for the euro area (EA) around policy announcement dates. We trace the dynamic effects of shocks to the short-term policy rate, forward guidance and quantitative easing on several key macroeconomic and financial quantities alongside survey-based measures of expectations. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian smooth-transition vector autoregression (ST-VAR). Our results suggest that transmission channels are impaired when uncertainty is elevated. While conventional monetary policy is less effective during such periods, and sometimes also forward guidance, quantitative easing measures seem to work comparatively well in uncertain times.",2020-11-29T19:21:55Z,2020-11-29T19:21:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14424v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14424v1,"econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
Generative Capacity of Probabilistic Protein Sequence Models,"Francisco McGee, Quentin Novinger, Ronald M. Levy, Vincenzo Carnevale, Allan Haldane","Potts models and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have recently gained popularity as generative protein sequence models (GPSMs) to explore fitness landscapes and predict the effect of mutations. Despite encouraging results, quantitative characterization and comparison of GPSM-generated probability distributions is still lacking. It is currently unclear whether GPSMs can faithfully reproduce the complex multi-residue mutation patterns observed in natural sequences arising due to epistasis. We develop a set of sequence statistics to assess the ""generative capacity"" of three GPSMs of recent interest: the pairwise Potts Hamiltonian, the VAE, and the site-independent model, using natural and synthetic datasets. We show that the generative capacity of the Potts Hamiltonian model is the largest, in that the higher order mutational statistics generated by the model agree with those observed for natural sequences. In contrast, we show that the VAE's generative capacity lies between the pairwise Potts and site-independent models. Importantly, our work measures GPSM generative capacity in terms of higher-order sequence covariation statistics which we have developed, and provides a new framework for evaluating and interpreting GPSM accuracy that emphasizes the role of epistasis.",2020-12-03T21:59:24Z,2021-03-15T21:15:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02296v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02296v2,"cs.LG, physics.data-an, q-bio.QM"

We show that this problem has a stable solution with quantitative stability estimates in a class of manifolds with bounded geometry. More precisely, we show that finitely many eigenvalues and the boundary values of corresponding eigenfunctions, known up to small errors, determine a metric space that is close to the manifold in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We provide an algorithm to construct this metric space.

A Comparative Analysis of the Ensemble Methods for Drug Design,"Rifkat Davronova, Fatima Adilovab","Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) is a computer modeling technique for identifying relationships between the structural properties of chemical compounds and biological activity. QSAR modeling is necessary for drug discovery, but it has many limitations. Ensemble-based machine learning approaches have been used to overcome limitations and generate reliable predictions. Ensemble learning creates a set of diverse models and combines them. In our comparative analysis, each ensemble algorithm was paired with each of the basic algorithms, but the basic algorithms were also investigated separately. In this configuration, 57 algorithms were developed and compared on 4 different datasets. Thus, a technique for complex ensemble method is proposed that builds diversified models and integrates them. The proposed individual models did not show impressive results as a unified model, but it was considered the most important predictor when combined. We assessed whether ensembles always give better results than individual algorithms.

This makes the FORC technique a powerful tool in the analysis of complex systems which cannot be effectively probed using localized techniques. However, recovering quantitative details about the identified phases which can be compared to traditionally measured metrics remains an enigmatic challenge. We demonstrate a technique to reconstruct phase-resolved magnetic hysteresis loops by selectively integrating the measured FORC distribution. From these minor loops, the traditional metrics - including the coercivity and saturation field, and the remanent and saturation magnetization - can be determined. In order to perform this analysis, special consideration must be paid to the accurate quantitative management of the so-called reversible features. This technique is demonstrated on three representative materials systems, high anisotropy FeCuPt thin-films, Fe nanodots, and SmCo/Fe exchange spring magnet films, and shows excellent agreement with the direct measured major loop, as well as the phase separated loops.",2020-12-20T22:23:56Z,2020-12-20T22:23:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11041v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11041v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.data-an"

An Evidential Reasoning Based Approach to Building Node Selection   Criterion for Network Reduction,"Bin Huang, Jiayong Li, Jianhui Wang","A reasonable node selection criterion (NSC) is crucial for the network reduction in power systems. In contrast to the previous works that only consider structure property, this paper proposes a comprehensive and quantitative NSC considering both structural and electrical properties. The proposed NSC is developed by employing the evidential reasoning approach, in which the quasi-one-hot encoding is used to determine the evaluation grades of different criteria or attributes. Then, different criteria are combined through the multi-evidence reasoning. Eventually, the utility evaluation is used to derive the quantitative NSC. Besides, the ER can be readily extended to multiple criteria while considering the uncertainty in the evaluation process simultaneously. The reduced models with higher accuracy can be built by combining the proposed NSC with the existing model reduction algorithms. The case studies on a 30-node power grid substantiate the practicality of the proposed NSC.",2020-12-26T07:07:11Z,2020-12-26T07:07:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13684v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13684v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

We develop a comprehensive, non-Markovian state transition model, which is validated through accurate prediction of the daily death toll for two epicenters: Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy. The model enables prediction of COVID-19 deaths in various scenarios. For example, if treatment priorities had been given to younger patients, the death toll in Wuhan and Lombardy would have been reduced by 10.4\% and 6.7\%, respectively. The strategy depends on the epidemic scale and is more effective in countries with a younger population structure. Analyses of data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain suggest that countries with less per capita ICU medical resources should implement this strategy in the early stage of the pandemic to reduce mortalities.",2020-12-27T14:33:58Z,2020-12-27T14:33:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13953v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13953v1,"physics.soc-ph, nlin.AO"

In this paper, we discuss scheduling a single-server system when exact information about the jobs' processing times is not available. When the SRPT policy uses estimated processing times, the underestimation of large jobs can significantly degrade performance. We propose a simple heuristic, Size Estimate Hedging (SEH), that only uses estimated processing times for scheduling decisions. A job's priority is increased dynamically according to an SRPT rule until it is determined that it is underestimated, at which time the priority is frozen. Numerical results suggest that SEH has desirable performance for estimation error variance that is consistent with what is seen in practice.",2020-12-30T00:25:44Z,2023-01-21T02:53:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00007v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00007v5,"cs.OH, math.OC"

Novel microfluidic devices enable the synthesis of temporal chemical concentration profiles. The informativeness of a perturbation can be quantified based on mutual information. We propose an approximate method to perform optimal experimental design of such perturbation profiles. To estimate the mutual information we perform a multivariate log-normal approximation of the joint distribution over parameters and observations and scan the design space using Metropolis-Hastings sampling.

A Universal Deep Learning Framework for Real-Time Denoising of   Ultrasound Images,"Simone Cammarasana, Paolo Nicolardi, Giuseppe Patanè","Ultrasound images are widespread in medical diagnosis for muscle-skeletal, cardiac, and obstetrical diseases, due to the efficiency and non-invasiveness of the acquisition methodology. However, ultrasound acquisition introduces noise in the signal, which corrupts the resulting image and affects further processing steps, e.g., segmentation and quantitative analysis. We define a novel deep learning framework for the real-time denoising of ultrasound images. Firstly, we compare state-of-the-art methods for denoising (e.g., spectral, low-rank methods) and select WNNM (Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimisation) as the best denoising in terms of accuracy, preservation of anatomical features, and edge enhancement. Then, we propose a tuned version of WNNM (tuned-WNNM) that improves the quality of the denoised images and extends its applicability to ultrasound images. Through a deep learning framework, the tuned-WNNM qualitatively and quantitatively replicates WNNM results in real-time. Finally, our approach is general in terms of its building blocks and parameters of the deep learning and high-performance computing framework; in fact, we can select different denoising algorithms and deep learning architectures.",2021-01-22T14:18:47Z,2022-05-04T13:59:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09122v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09122v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV, 68U10"

Transversal families of nonlinear projections and generalizations of   Favard length,"Rosemarie Bongers, Krystal Taylor","Projections detect information about the size, geometric arrangement, and dimension of sets. To approach this, one can study the energies of measures supported on a set and the energies for the corresponding pushforward measures on the projection side. For orthogonal projections, quantitative estimates rely on a separation condition: most points are well-differentiated by most projections. It turns out that this idea also applies to a broad class of nonlinear projection-type operators satisfying a \textit{transversality condition}. In this work, we establish that several important classes of nonlinear projections are transversal. This leads to quantitative lower bounds for decay rates for nonlinear variants of Favard length, including Favard curve length (as well as a new generalization to higher dimensions, called Favard surface length) and visibility measurements associated to radial projections.

Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, https://www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening.",2021-05-06T11:56:27Z,2021-05-06T11:56:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02597v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02597v1,"physics.data-an, physics.bio-ph, q-bio.QM, stat.ML"
Structure and electron dynamics of planetary states of Sr below the   Sr$^+$ $7d$ and $8p$ thresholds,"Matthieu Génévriez, Christian Rosen, Ulrich Eichmann","In a combined experimental and theoretical study we investigate the $7dnl$ and $8pnl$ ($n\ge 11$, $l=9-12$) doubly-excited planetary states of Sr. The experimental spectrum was obtained using a five-photon resonant excitation scheme. The method of configuration interaction with exterior complex scaling was used to compute the energy-level structure and dynamics of the two highly excited electrons from first principles. Good quantitative agreement was obtained with the spectra we recorded, and the theoretical calculations shed light on their complex structure and the signatures of electron correlations therein. The two-electron probability densities we calculated reveal the strongly-correlated angular motion of the two electrons in the $7dnl$ and $8pnl$ planetary states, and confirm quantitatively the predictions of the frozen-planet approximation describing electron dynamics as the polarization of the fast inner electron by the electric field of the outer ""frozen"" electron.",2021-05-07T12:09:08Z,2021-05-07T12:09:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03196v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03196v1,"physics.atom-ph, quant-ph"
Optical microscopy-based thickness estimation in thin GaSe flakes,"Wenliang Zhang, Qinghua Zhao, Sergio Puebla, Tao Wang, Riccardo Frisenda, Andres Castellanos-Gomez","We have implemented three different optical methods to quantitatively assess the thickness of thin GaSe flakes transferred on both transparent substrates, like Gel-Film, or SiO2/Si substrates. We show how their apparent color can be an efficient way to make a quick rough estimation of the thickness of the flakes. This method is more effective for SiO2/Si substrates as the thickness dependent color change is more pronounced on these substrates than on transparent substrates. On the other hand, for transparent substrates, the transmittance of the flakes in the blue region of the visible spectrum can be used to estimate the thickness. We find that the transmittance of flakes in the blue part of the spectrum decreases at a rate of 1.2%/nm. On SiO2/Si, the thickness of the flakes can be accurately determined by fitting optical contrast spectra to a Fresnel law-based model. Finally, we also show how the quantitative analysis of transmission mode optical microscopy images can be a powerful method to quickly probe the environmental degradation of GaSe flakes exposed to aging conditions.",2021-05-07T20:30:47Z,2021-05-07T20:30:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03496v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03496v1,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.app-ph"
A parallel-network continuous quantitative trading model with GARCH and   PPO,"Zhishun Wang, Wei Lu, Kaixin Zhang, Tianhao Li, Zixi Zhao","It is a difficult task for both professional investors and individual traders continuously making profit in stock market. With the development of computer science and deep reinforcement learning, Buy\&Hold (B\&H) has been oversteped by many artificial intelligence trading algorithms. However, the information and process are not enough, which limit the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. Thus, we propose a parallel-network continuous quantitative trading model with GARCH and PPO to enrich the basical deep reinforcement learning model, where the deep learning parallel network layers deal with 3 different frequencies data (including GARCH information) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm interacts actions and rewards with stock trading environment.

Reinforcement Learning with Expert Trajectory For Quantitative Trading,"Sihang Chen, Weiqi Luo, Chao Yu","In recent years, quantitative investment methods combined with artificial intelligence have attracted more and more attention from investors and researchers. Existing related methods based on the supervised learning are not very suitable for learning problems with long-term goals and delayed rewards in real futures trading. In this paper, therefore, we model the price prediction problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and optimize it by reinforcement learning with expert trajectory. In the proposed method, we employ more than 100 short-term alpha factors instead of price, volume and several technical factors in used existing methods to describe the states of MDP. Furthermore, unlike DQN (deep Q-learning) and BC (behavior cloning) in related methods, we introduce expert experience in training stage, and consider both the expert-environment interaction and the agent-environment interaction to design the temporal difference error so that the agents are more adaptable for inevitable noise in financial data. Experimental results evaluated on share price index futures in China, including IF (CSI 300) and IC (CSI 500), show that the advantages of the proposed method compared with three typical technical analysis and two deep leaning based methods.",2021-05-09T05:49:21Z,2021-05-09T05:49:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03844v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03844v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, q-fin.TR"
Efficient Algorithms for Quantitative Attack Tree Analysis,"Carlos E. Budde, Mariëlle Stoelinga","Numerous analysis methods for quantitative attack tree analysis have been proposed. These algorithms compute relevant security metrics, i.e. performance indicators that quantify how good the security of a system is, such as the most likely attack, the cheapest, or the most damaging one. This paper classifies attack trees in two dimensions: proper trees vs. directed acyclic graphs (i.e. with shared subtrees); and static vs. dynamic gates. For each class, we propose novel algorithms that work over a generic attribute domain, encompassing a large number of concrete security metrics defined on the attack tree semantics. We also analyse the computational complexity of our methods.",2021-05-16T20:52:20Z,2021-05-22T10:28:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07511v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07511v2,"cs.CR, cs.DS, F.1.0; F.2.2; G.2.3"
Restricted weak type inequalities for the one-sided Hardy-Littlewood   maximal operators in higher dimensions,Fabio Berra,"We give a quantitative characterization of the pairs of weights $(w,v)$ for which the dyadic version of the one-sided Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator satisfies a restricted weak $(p,p)$ type inequality, for $1\leq p<\infty$. More precisely, given any measurable set $E_0$ the estimate \[w(\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n: M^{+,d}(\mathcal{X}_{E_0})(x)>t\})\leq \frac{C[(w,v)]_{A_p^{+,d}(\mathcal{R})}^p}{t^p}v(E_0)\] holds if and only if the pair $(w,v)$ belongs to $A_p^{+,d}(\mathcal{R})$, that is \[\frac{|E|}{|Q|}\leq [(w,v)]_{A_p^{+,d}(\mathcal{R})}\left(\frac{v(E)}{w(Q)}\right)^{1/p}\] for every dyadic cube $Q$ and every measurable set $E\subset Q^+$.

A statistical model of COVID-19 testing in populations: effects of   sampling bias and testing errors,"Lucas Böttcher, Maria R.

The model assumes a binary test result, positive or negative, but allows for biases in sample selection and both type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) testing errors. Our model also incorporates multiple test types and is able to distinguish between retesting and exclusion after testing. Our quantitative framework allows us to directly interpret testing results as a function of errors and biases. By applying our testing model to COVID-19 testing data and actual case data from specific jurisdictions, we are able to estimate and provide uncertainty quantification of indices that are crucial in a pandemic, such as disease prevalence and fatality ratios.",2021-05-24T10:21:26Z,2021-05-24T10:21:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11961v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11961v1,"stat.AP, physics.soc-ph, q-bio.QM"
Čerenkov radiation in vacuum from a superluminal grating,"Daigo Oue, Kun Ding, J. B. Pendry","Nothing can physically travel faster than light in vacuum. This is why it has been considered that there is no \v{C}erenkov radiation (\v{C}R) without an effective refractive index due to some background field. In this Letter, we theoretically predict \v{C}R in vacuum from a spatiotemporally modulated boundary. We consider the modulation of traveling wave type and apply a uniform electrostatic field on the boundary to generate electric dipoles. Since the induced dipoles stick to the interface, they travel at the modulation speed. When the grating travels faster than light, it emits \v{C}R. In order to quantitatively examine this argument, we need to calculate the field scattered at the boundary. We utilise a dynamical differential method, which we developed in the previous paper, to quantitatively evaluate the field distribution in such a situation. We can confirm that all scattered fields are evanescent if the modulation speed is slower than light while some become propagating if the modulation is faster than light.",2021-05-28T08:59:23Z,2021-05-28T08:59:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13681v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13681v1,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mes-hall"
LTL-Constrained Steady-State Policy Synthesis,Jan Křetínský,"Decision-making policies for agents are often synthesized with the constraint that a formal specification of behaviour is satisfied. Here we focus on infinite-horizon properties. On the one hand, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a popular example of a formalism for qualitative specifications. On the other hand, Steady-State Policy Synthesis (SSPS) has recently received considerable attention as it provides a more quantitative and more behavioural perspective on specifications, in terms of the frequency with which states are visited. Finally, rewards provide a classic framework for quantitative properties. In this paper, we study Markov decision processes (MDP) with the specification combining all these three types. The derived policy maximizes the reward among all policies ensuring the LTL specification with the given probability and adhering to the steady-state constraints. To this end, we provide a unified solution reducing the multi-type specification to a multi-dimensional long-run average reward. This is enabled by Limit-Deterministic B\""uchi Automata (LDBA), recently studied in the context of LTL model checking on MDP, and allows for an elegant solution through a simple linear programme. The algorithm also extends to the general $\omega$-regular properties and runs in time polynomial in the sizes of the MDP as well as the LDBA.",2021-05-31T11:35:42Z,2021-05-31T11:35:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14894v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14894v1,"cs.AI, cs.LO, cs.SY, eess.SY"
Deep Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Algorithmic Trading: A   Review,Tidor-Vlad Pricope,"Algorithmic stock trading has become a staple in today's financial market, the majority of trades being now fully automated. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents proved to be to a force to be reckon with in many complex games like Chess and Go. We can look at the stock market historical price series and movements as a complex imperfect information environment in which we try to maximize return - profit and minimize risk. This paper reviews the progress made so far with deep reinforcement learning in the subdomain of AI in finance, more precisely, automated low-frequency quantitative stock trading. Many of the reviewed studies had only proof-of-concept ideals with experiments conducted in unrealistic settings and no real-time trading applications. For the majority of the works, despite all showing statistically significant improvements in performance compared to established baseline strategies, no decent profitability level was obtained. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental testing in real-time, online trading platforms and a lack of meaningful comparisons between agents built on different types of DRL or human traders. We conclude that DRL in stock trading has showed huge applicability potential rivalling professional traders under strong assumptions, but the research is still in the very early stages of development.",2021-05-31T22:26:43Z,2021-05-31T22:26:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00123v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00123v1,"cs.LG, q-fin.TR"
Parameter Inference with Bifurcation Diagrams,"Gregory Szep, Neil Dalchau, Attila Csikasz-Nagy","Estimation of parameters in differential equation models can be achieved by applying learning algorithms to quantitative time-series data. However, sometimes it is only possible to measure qualitative changes of a system in response to a controlled condition. In dynamical systems theory, such change points are known as bifurcations and lie on a function of the controlled condition called the bifurcation diagram. In this work, we propose a gradient-based approach for inferring the parameters of differential equations that produce a user-specified bifurcation diagram. The cost function contains an error term that is minimal when the model bifurcations match the specified targets and a bifurcation measure which has gradients that push optimisers towards bifurcating parameter regimes. The gradients can be computed without the need to differentiate through the operations of the solver that was used to compute the diagram. We demonstrate parameter inference with minimal models which explore the space of saddle-node and pitchfork diagrams and the genetic toggle switch from synthetic biology. Furthermore, the cost landscape allows us to organise models in terms of topological and geometric equivalence.",2021-06-08T10:39:19Z,2021-10-27T13:33:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04243v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04243v3,"cs.LG, math.DS, q-bio.QM"

Similarly to the Riemannian case, where the inequality holds under a topological assumption of ""essentiality"", our proofs rely on a combinatorial analogue of that assumption. Under a stronger assumption, expressed in terms of cohomology cup-length, we improve our results quantitatively.

We establish a quantitative relation between the spatial resolution and the twin photon position correlation in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process (SPDC). Furthermore, we also quantitatively establish the roles that the wavelength of the undetected illumination field and the wavelength of the detected field play in the resolution. Like ghost imaging and unlike conventional imaging, the resolution limit imposed by the spatial correlation between twin photons in QIUP cannot be further improved by conventional optical techniques.",2021-06-21T18:40:46Z,2021-06-23T06:24:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11358v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11358v2,"quant-ph, physics.optics"

To do this, we show how to modify the Reifenberg Parametrization Theorem of David and Toro so that it holds in Hilbert space. As a corollary, we show that a set $E \subseteq H$ is uniformly rectifiable if and only if it satisfies the so-called Bilateral Weak Geometric Lemma, meaning that $E$ is bi-laterally well approximated by planes at most scales and locations.",2021-06-23T21:41:06Z,2021-06-23T21:41:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12661v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12661v1,"math.CA, math.MG, 28A12, 28A75, 28A78"

Exact Simulation of Pigment-Protein Complexes Unveils Vibronic   Renormalization of Electronic Parameters in Ultrafast Spectroscopy,"F. Caycedo-Soler, A. Mattioni, J. Lim, T. Renger, S. F. Huelga, M.

Generically, PPCs possess highly structured vibrational spectra, combining many discrete intra-pigment modes and a quasi-continuous of protein modes, with vibrational and electronic couplings of comparable strength. The intricacy of the resulting vibronic dynamics poses significant challenges in establishing a quantitative connection between spectroscopic data and underlying microscopic models. Here we show how to address this challenge using numerically exact simulation methods by considering two model systems, namely the water-soluble chlorophyll-binding protein of cauliflower and the special pair of bacterial reaction centers. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the full multi-mode vibronic dynamics in numerical calculations of linear spectra leads to systematic and quantitatively significant corrections to electronic parameter estimation.

Improved Padding in CNNs for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping,Juan Liu,"Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) data processing: background field removal, field-to-source inversion, and single-step QSM reconstruction. However, the conventional padding mechanism used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can introduce spatial artifacts, especially in QSM background field removal and single-step QSM which requires inference from total fields with extreme large values at the edge boundaries of volume of interest. To address this issue, we propose an improved padding technique which utilizes the neighboring valid voxels to estimate the invalid voxels of feature maps at volume boundaries in the neural networks. Studies using simulated and in-vivo data show that the proposed padding greatly improves estimation accuracy and reduces artifacts in the results in the tasks of background field removal, field-to-source inversion, and single-step QSM reconstruction.",2021-06-21T01:35:00Z,2021-06-21T01:35:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15331v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15331v1,"cs.CV, eess.IV"

This is as a result of the smooth-out effect they have on the images. Most neural network-based algorithms have achieved better quantitative performance than the classical denoising algorithms. However, they also suffer from qualitative (visual) performance as a result of the smooth-out effect. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to address this shortcoming. We propose a deep collaborative filtering-based (Deep-CoFiB) algorithm for image denoising. This algorithm performs collaborative denoising of image patches in the sparse domain using a set of optimized neural network models. This results in a fast algorithm that is able to excellently obtain a trade-off between noise removal and details preservation.

However, recent reconstruction challenges have shown several drawbacks in current deep learning approaches, including the loss of fine image details even using models that perform well in terms of global quality metrics. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for image reconstruction and pathology detection, which enables a clinically aware evaluation of deep learning reconstruction quality. The solution is demonstrated for a use case in detecting meniscal tears on knee MRI studies, ultimately finding a loss of fine image details with common reconstruction methods expressed as a reduced ability to detect important pathology like meniscal tears. Despite the common practice of quantitative reconstruction methodology evaluation with metrics such as SSIM, impaired pathology detection as an automated pathology-based reconstruction evaluation approach suggests existing quantitative methods do not capture clinically important reconstruction outcomes.",2021-09-23T17:46:08Z,2021-09-23T17:46:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11524v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11524v1,"cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV, physics.med-ph"

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are considered to be promising assets to restore suitable frequency regulation capacity levels. BESSs are typically connected to the grid with power-converters, able to operate in either grid-forming or grid-following modes. This paper quantitatively assesses the impact on the local distribution grid of BESSs providing frequency regulation to bulk power systems. Specific metrics are proposed to compare the performance of grid-forming and grid-following control. Experimental results are obtained taking advantage of a 720 kVA/500 kWh BESS connected to the 20 kV distribution grid of the EPFL campus.

Cellular resource allocation strategies for cell size and shape control   in bacteria,"Diana Serbanescu, Nikola Ojkic, Shiladitya Banerjee","Bacteria are highly adaptive microorganisms that thrive in a wide range of growth conditions via changes in cell morphologies and macromolecular composition. How bacterial morphologies are regulated in diverse environmental conditions is a longstanding question. Regulation of cell size and shape implies control mechanisms that couple the growth and division of bacteria to their cellular environment and macromolecular composition. In the past decade, simple quantitative laws have emerged that connect cell growth to proteomic composition and the nutrient availability. However, the relationships between cell size, shape and growth physiology remain challenging to disentangle and unifying models are lacking. In this review, we focus on regulatory models of cell size control that reveal the connections between bacterial cell morphology and growth physiology. In particular, we discuss how changes in nutrient conditions and translational perturbations regulate the cell size, growth rate and proteome composition. Integrating quantitative models with experimental data, we identify the physiological principles of bacterial size regulation, and discuss the optimization strategies of cellular resource allocation for size control.",2021-10-16T13:55:16Z,2021-10-16T13:55:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08575v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08575v1,"q-bio.CB, physics.bio-ph"

It relies on the interference between a probe beam and the coherent response of the object. In the low saturation regime, it is well described by a Beer Lambert attenuation. In this paper we theoretically derive the absorption of a $\sigma$ polarized laser probe by an ensemble of two-level systems in any saturation regime. We experimentally demonstrate that the absorption cross section in dense $^{87}$Rb cold atom ensembles is reduced, with respect to the single particle response, by a factor proportional to the optical density b of the medium. To explain this reduction, we developed a model that incorporates, in the single particle response, the incoherent electromagnetic background emitted by the surrounding ensemble. We show that it qualitatively reproduces the experimental results.

TA-Net: Topology-Aware Network for Gland Segmentation,"Haotian Wang, Min Xian, Aleksandar Vakanski","Gland segmentation is a critical step to quantitatively assess the morphology of glands in histopathology image analysis. However, it is challenging to separate densely clustered glands accurately. Existing deep learning-based approaches attempted to use contour-based techniques to alleviate this issue but only achieved limited success. To address this challenge, we propose a novel topology-aware network (TA-Net) to accurately separate densely clustered and severely deformed glands. The proposed TA-Net has a multitask learning architecture and enhances the generalization of gland segmentation by learning shared representation from two tasks: instance segmentation and gland topology estimation. The proposed topology loss computes gland topology using gland skeletons and markers. It drives the network to generate segmentation results that comply with the true gland topology. We validate the proposed approach on the GlaS and CRAG datasets using three quantitative metrics, F1-score, object-level Dice coefficient, and object-level Hausdorff distance.

This may not be useful when the acquisition process is unknown during training of the deep learning model and/or changes during testing time. This paper proposes an iterative deep learning plug-and-play reconstruction approach to MRF which is adaptive to the forward acquisition process. Spatiotemporal image priors are learned by an image denoiser i.e. a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained to remove generic white gaussian noise (not a particular subsampling artefact) from data. This CNN denoiser is then used as a data-driven shrinkage operator within the iterative reconstruction algorithm. This algorithm with the same denoiser model is then tested on two simulated acquisition processes with distinct subsampling patterns.

Direct assessment of individual connotation and experience: An   introduction to cognitive-affective mapping,"Lisa Reuter, Jordan Mansell, Carter Rhea, Andrea Kiesel","We introduce cognitive-affective maps (CAMs) as a novel tool to assess individual experiences and belief systems. CAMs were first presented by the cognitive scientist and philosopher Paul Thagard as a graphical representation of a mental network, visualizing attitudes, thoughts, and affective connotations toward the topic of interest. While CAMs were originally used primarily to visualize existing data, the recent release of the new software tool Valence has facilitated the applicability of CAMs for empirical data collection. In this article, we explain the concept and the theoretical background of CAMs. We exemplify how CAMs can be applied in research practice, including different options for analysis. We propose CAMs as a user-friendly and versatile methodological bridge between qualitative and quantitative research approaches and encourage incorporating the method into studies to access and visualize human attitudes and experience.",2022-02-20T22:01:16Z,2022-02-20T22:01:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09916v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09916v1,"q-bio.PE, cs.HC, q-bio.QM"
Building prescribed quantitative orbit equivalence with the group of   integers,Amandine Escalier,"Two groups are orbit equivalent if they both admit an action on a same probability space that share the same orbits. In particular the Ornstein-Weiss theorem implies that all infinite amenable groups are orbit equivalent to the group of integers. To refine this notion between infinite amenable groups Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera introduced a quantitative version of orbit equivalence. They furthermore obtained obstructions to the existence of such equivalence using the isoperimetric profile. In this article we offer to answer the inverse problem (find a group being orbit equivalent to a prescribed group with prescribed quantification) in the case of the group of integers using the so called F{\o}lner tiling shifts introduced by Delabie et al. To do so we use the diagonal products defined by Brieussel and Zheng giving groups with prescribed isoperimetric profile.",2022-02-21T15:35:53Z,2023-01-03T15:36:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10312v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10312v4,"math.GR, math.DS, 37A20"
Quantitative characterisation of the layered structure within   lithium-ion batteries using ultrasonic resonance,"Ming Huang, Niall Kirkaldy, Yan Zhao, Yatish Patel, Frederic Cegla, Bo Lan","Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are becoming an important energy storage solution to achieve carbon neutrality, but it remains challenging to characterise their internal states for the assurance of performance, durability and safety. This work reports a simple but powerful non-destructive characterisation technique, based on the formation of ultrasonic resonance from the repetitive layers within LIBs. A physical model is developed from the ground up, to interpret the results from standard experimental ultrasonic measurement setups. As output, the method delivers a range of critical pieces of information about the inner structure of LIBs, such as the number of layers, the average thicknesses of electrodes, the image of internal layers, and the states of charge variations across individual layers. This enables the quantitative tracking of internal cell properties, potentially providing new means of quality control during production processes, and tracking the states of health and charge during operation.",2022-03-08T15:22:23Z,2022-03-22T15:52:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04149v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04149v2,"physics.class-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci"
Performance-Robustness Tradeoffs in Adversarially Robust   Linear-Quadratic Control,"Bruce D. Lee, Thomas T. C. K. Zhang, Hamed Hassani, Nikolai Matni","While $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ methods can introduce robustness against worst-case perturbations, their nominal performance under conventional stochastic disturbances is often drastically reduced. Though this fundamental tradeoff between nominal performance and robustness is known to exist, it is not well-characterized in quantitative terms. Toward addressing this issue, we borrow from the increasingly ubiquitous notion of adversarial training from machine learning to construct a class of controllers which are optimized for disturbances consisting of mixed stochastic and worst-case components. We find that this problem admits a stationary optimal controller that has a simple analytic form closely related to suboptimal $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ solutions. We then provide a quantitative performance-robustness tradeoff analysis, in which system-theoretic properties such as controllability and stability explicitly manifest in an interpretable manner. This provides practitioners with general guidance for determining how much robustness to incorporate based on a priori system knowledge. We empirically validate our results by comparing the performance of our controller against standard baselines, and plotting tradeoff curves.",2022-03-21T07:13:13Z,2022-03-21T07:13:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10763v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10763v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"
"Inventories, Demand Shocks Propagation and Amplification in Supply   Chains",Alessandro Ferrari,"I study the role of industries' position in supply chains in shaping the transmission of final demand shocks. First, I use a shift-share design based on destination-specific final demand shocks and destination exposure shares to show that shocks amplify upstream. Quantitatively, upstream industries respond to final demand shocks up to three times as much as final goods producers, in line with the bullwhip effect. To organize the reduced form results, I develop a tractable production network model with inventories and study how the properties of the network and the cyclicality of inventories interact to determine whether final demand shocks amplify or dissipate upstream. I test the mechanism by directly estimating the model-implied relationship between output growth and demand shocks, mediated by network position and inventories. I find evidence of the role of inventories in explaining heterogeneous output elasticities. Finally, I use the model to quantitatively study how inventories and network properties shape the volatility of the economy.",2022-05-08T13:28:00Z,2024-10-11T11:19:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03862v6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03862v6,"econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
Stochastic uncertainty analysis of gravity gradient tensor components   and their combinations,"Pejman Shamsipour, Amin Aghaee, Tedd Kourkounakis, Shawn Hood","Full tensor gravity (FTG) devices provide up to five independent components of the gravity gradient tensor. However, we do not yet have a quantitative understanding of which tensor components or combinations of components are more important to recover a subsurface density model by gravity inversion. This is mainly because different components may be more appropriate in different scenarios or purposes. Knowledge of these components in different environments can aid with selection of optimal selection of component combinations. In this work, we propose to apply stochastic inversion to assess the uncertainty of gravity gradient tensor components and their combinations. The method is therefore a quantitative approach. The applied method here is based on the geostatistical inversion (Gaussian process regression) concept using cokriging. The cokriging variances (variance function of the GP) are found to be a useful indicator for distinguishing the gravity gradient tensor components. This approach is applied to the New Found dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world applications.",2022-05-18T18:20:53Z,2022-05-18T18:20:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09159v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09159v1,"physics.geo-ph, cs.LG"
Conductivity of an electron coupled to anharmonic phonons,"Jonathan H. Fetherolf, Petra Shih, Timothy C. Berkelbach","We study the impact of phonon anharmonicity on the electronic dynamics of soft materials using a nonperturbative quantum-classical approach. The method is applied to a one-dimensional model of doped organic semiconductors with low-frequency intermolecular lattice phonons. We find that anharmonicity that leads to phonon hardening increases the mobility and anharmonicity that leads to phonon softening decreases the mobility. We also test various approximations, including the use of adiabatic phonon disorder, an effective harmonic model with temperature-dependent frequencies, and the Boltzmann transport equation with second-order perturbation theory scattering rates. Overall, we find surprisingly good agreement between all methods but that accounting for phonon anharmonicity is important for accurate prediction of electronic transport including both quantitative mobility values and their qualitative temperature dependence. For the model studied, phonon lifetime effects have relatively little impact on carrier transport, but the effective frequency shift due to anharmonicity is essential. In cases with highly asymmetric, non-Gaussian disorder, an effective harmonic model cannot quantitatively reproduce mobilities or finite-frequency conductivity, and this is especially true for acoustic phonons.",2022-05-19T19:15:17Z,2022-05-19T19:15:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09811v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09811v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.chem-ph"

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems can aid first responders by maneuvering autonomously in areas inside buildings dangerous for humans to traverse, exploring the interior, and providing an accurate and reliable indoor map before the emergency response team takes action. Due to the challenging conditions in such scenarios and the inherent battery limitations and time constraints, we investigate 2D autonomous exploration strategies (e.g., based on 2D LiDAR) for mapping 3D indoor environments.

Second, we perform extensive simulation experiments in diverse indoor environments using various state-of-the-art 2D LiDAR-based exploration strategies.

Kinetic chemotaxis tumbling kernel determined from macroscopic   quantities,"Kathrin Hellmuth, Christian Klingenberg, Qin Li, Min Tang","Chemotaxis is the physical phenomenon that bacteria adjust their motions according to chemical stimulus. A classical model for this phenomenon is a kinetic equation that describes the velocity jump process whose tumbling/transition kernel uniquely determines the effect of chemical stimulus on bacteria. The model has been shown to be an accurate model that matches with bacteria motion qualitatively. For a quantitative modeling, biophysicists and practitioners are also highly interested in determining the explicit value of the tumbling kernel. Due to the experimental limitations, measurements are typically macroscopic in nature. Do macroscopic quantities contain enough information to recover microscopic behavior? In this paper, we give a positive answer. We show that when given a special design of initial data, the population density, one specific macroscopic quantity as a function of time, contains sufficient information to recover the tumbling kernel and its associated damping coefficient. Moreover, we can read off the chemotaxis tumbling kernel using the values of population density directly from this specific experimental design.

CPES-QSM: A Quantitative Method Towards the Secure Operation of   Cyber-Physical Energy Systems,"Juan Ospina, Venkatesh Venkataramanan, Charalambos Konstantinou","Power systems are evolving into cyber-physical energy systems (CPES) due to the integration of modern communication and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. CPES security evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber layers are often not considered holistically. Existing literature focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them. This paper proposes a metric, the Cyber-Physical Energy System Quantitative Security Metric (CPES-QSM), that quantifies the interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three domains: electrical, cyber-risk, and network topology. A method for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained AC optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of all the CPES layers. The cyber-constrained ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such as voltage stability, contingencies, graph-theory, and IoT cyber risks, while using a multi-criteria decision-making technique.

Smooth Pycnophylactic Interpolation Produced by Density-Equalising Map   Projections,"Michael T. Gastner, Nihal Z.

Smooth pycnophylactic interpolation aims to find a smooth, nonnegative function such that the area integral over each enumeration unit is equal to the aggregated data. Conventionally, smooth pycnophylactic interpolation is achieved by a cellular automaton algorithm that converts a piecewise constant function into an approximately smooth function defined on a grid of coordinates on an equal-area map. An alternative approach, proposed by Tobler in 1976, is to construct a density-equalising map projection in which areas of enumeration units are proportional to the aggregated data. A pycnophylactic interpolation can be obtained from the Jacobian of this projection. Here, we describe a software implementation of this method. Although solutions are not necessarily optimal in terms of predefined quantitative measures of smoothness, our method is computationally efficient and can potentially be used in tandem with other methods to accelerate convergence towards an optimal solution.",2022-07-01T21:19:56Z,2022-07-01T21:19:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00663v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00663v1,"stat.CO, cs.CG"
Bayesian approaches for Quantifying Clinicians' Variability in Medical   Image Quantification,"Jaeik Jeon, Yeonggul Jang, Youngtaek Hong, Hackjoon Shim, Sekeun Kim","Medical imaging, including MRI, CT, and Ultrasound, plays a vital role in clinical decisions. Accurate segmentation is essential to measure the structure of interest from the image. However, manual segmentation is highly operator-dependent, which leads to high inter and intra-variability of quantitative measurements. In this paper, we explore the feasibility that Bayesian predictive distribution parameterized by deep neural networks can capture the clinicians' inter-intra variability. By exploring and analyzing recently emerged approximate inference schemes, we evaluate whether approximate Bayesian deep learning with the posterior over segmentations can learn inter-intra rater variability both in segmentation and clinical measurements. The experiments are performed with two different imaging modalities: MRI and ultrasound. We empirically demonstrated that Bayesian predictive distribution parameterized by deep neural networks could approximate the clinicians' inter-intra variability.

By matching the holographic vortex dynamics with the phenomenological dissipative Gross-Pitaeviskii models, we find that the holographic dissipation mechanism can be well captured by the Landau form rather than the Keldysh one, although the latter is much more widely used in numerical simulations. Our finding is expected to open up novel avenues for facilitating the quantitative test of the holographic predictions against the upcoming experimental data.

Homo economicus to model human behavior is ethically doubtful and   mathematically inconsistent,"M. Lunkenheimer, A. Kracklauer, G. Klinkova, M.

Unfortunately (or fortunately), humans are in general not homines economici as e.g. the ultimatum game shows. This leads to the fact that all these models are at least doubtful. Moreover, economists started to set a quantitative value for the feeling of social justice, altruism, or envy and the like to execute utilitarian calculation. Besides being ethically doubtful, it delivers an explanation in hindsight with little predicting power. We use examples from game theory to show its arbitrariness. It is even possible that a stable Nash equilibrium can be calculated while it does not exist at all, due to the wide differences in human values. Finally, we show that assigned numbers for envy or altruism and the like do not build a field (in a mathematical sense). As there is no homomorphism to real numbers or a subset of it, any calculation is generally invalid or arbitrary. There is no (easy) way to fix the problem. One has to go back to ethical concepts like the categorical imperative or use at most semi quantitative approaches like considering knaves and knights.

Interpreting equational theories in the category of sets has undesirable limitations, and we would like to have more examples of presentations in other categories.

Quantitatively visualizing bipartite datasets,"Tal Einav, Yuehaw Khoo, Amit Singer","As experiments continue to increase in size and scope, a fundamental challenge of subsequent analyses is to recast the wealth of information into an intuitive and readily-interpretable form. Often, each measurement only conveys the relationship between a pair of entries, and it is difficult to integrate these local interactions across a dataset to form a cohesive global picture. The classic localization problem tackles this question, transforming local measurements into a global map that reveals the underlying structure of a system. Here, we examine the more challenging bipartite localization problem, where pairwise distances are only available for bipartite data comprising two classes of entries (such as antibody-virus interactions, drug-cell potency, or user-rating profiles). We modify previous algorithms to solve bipartite localization and examine how each method behaves in the presence of noise, outliers, and partially-observed data. As a proof of concept, we apply these algorithms to antibody-virus neutralization measurements to create a basis set of antibody behaviors, formalize how potently inhibiting some viruses necessitates weakly inhibiting other viruses, and quantify how often combinations of antibodies exhibit degenerate behavior.",2022-07-26T05:00:09Z,2022-07-26T05:00:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12658v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.12658v1,"physics.bio-ph, physics.soc-ph, q-bio.QM"
On a lower bound of the number of integers in Littlewood's conjecture,Shunsuke Usuki,"We show that, for any $0<\gamma<1/2$, any $(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ except on a set with Hausdorff dimension about $\sqrt{\gamma}$, any small $0<\varepsilon<1$ and any large $N\in\mathbb{N}$, the number of integers $n\in[1,N]$ such that $n\langle n\alpha\rangle\langle n\beta\rangle<\varepsilon$ is greater than $\gamma\varepsilon\log N$ up to a uniform constant.

Lindenstrauss in 2000's. For the proof, we study the behavior of the empirical measures with respect to the diagonal action on $\rm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})/\rm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$ and show that we can obtain a quantitative result on Littlewood's conjecture for $(\alpha,\beta)$ if the corresponding empirical measures are well-behaved.

Gradient estimates for the Schrödinger potentials: convergence to the   Brenier map and quantitative stability,"Alberto Chiarini, Giovanni Conforti, Giacomo Greco, Luca Tamanini","We show convergence of the gradients of the Schr\""odinger potentials to the Brenier map in the small-time limit under general assumptions on the marginals, which allow for unbounded densities and supports. Furthermore, we provide novel quantitative stability estimates for the optimal values and optimal couplings for the Schr\""odinger problem (SP), that we express in terms of a negative order weighted homogeneous Sobolev norm. The latter encodes the linearized behavior of the 2-Wasserstein distance between the marginals. The proofs of both results highlight for the first time the relevance of gradient bounds for Schr\""odinger potentials, that we establish here in full generality, in the analysis of the short-time behavior of Schr\""odinger bridges.

Megaripple mechanics: bimodal transport ingrained in bimodal sands,"Katharina Tholen, Thomas Pähtz, Hezi Yizhaq, Itzhak Katra, Klaus Kroy","Aeolian sand transport is a major process shaping landscapes on Earth and on diverse celestial bodies. Conditions favoring bimodal sand transport, with fine-grain saltation driving coarse-grain reptation, give rise to the evolution of megaripples with a characteristic bimodal sand composition. Here, we derive a unified phase diagram for this special aeolian process and the ensuing nonequilibrium megaripple morphodynamics by means of a conceptually simple quantitative model, grounded in the grain-scale physics. We establish a well-preserved quantitative signature of bimodal aeolian transport in the otherwise highly variable grain size distributions, namely, the log-scale width (Krumbein phi scale) of their coarse-grain peaks.

The proof involves a quantitative and directional PE notion, allowing to characterize robust PE properties via singular value bounds, as opposed to binary rank-based PE conditions.

Computer Vision Methods for the Microstructural Analysis of Materials:   The State-of-the-art and Future Perspectives,"Khaled Alrfou, Amir Kordijazi, Tian Zhao","Finding quantitative descriptors representing the microstructural features of a given material is an ongoing research area in the paradigm of Materials-by-Design. Historically, microstructural analysis mostly relies on qualitative descriptions. However, to build a robust and accurate process-structure-properties relationship, which is required for designing new advanced high-performance materials, the extraction of quantitative and meaningful statistical data from the microstructural analysis is a critical step. In recent years, computer vision (CV) methods, especially those which are centered around convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms have shown promising results for this purpose. This review paper focuses on the state-of-the-art CNN-based techniques that have been applied to various multi-scale microstructural image analysis tasks, including classification, object detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and reconstruction. Additionally, we identified the main challenges with regard to the application of these methods to materials science research.

Quantitative phase imaging via the holomorphic property of complex   optical fields,"Jeonghun Oh, Herve Hugonnet, YongKeun Park","An optical field is described by the amplitude and phase, and thus has a complex representation described in the complex plane. However, because the only thing we can measure is the amplitude of the complex field on the real axis, it is difficult to identify how the complex field behaves throughout the complex plane. In this study, we interpreted quantitative phase imaging methods via the Hilbert transform in terms of analytic continuation, manifesting the behavior in the whole complex plane. Using Rouche's theorem, we proved the imaging conditions imposed by Kramers-Kronig holographic imaging. The deviation from the Kramers-Kronig holography conditions was examined using computational images and experimental data. We believe that this study provides a clue for holographic imaging using the holomorphic characteristics of a complex optical field.",2022-08-28T08:02:25Z,2022-08-28T08:02:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13168v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13168v1,"physics.optics, math-ph, math.MP"

However, measuring temperature gradients generated at the microscale by assemblies of AuNPs remains challenging, especially when they are randomly distributed in three dimensions. Here, we introduce a label-free thermometry approach, combining optical wavefront microscopy and numerical simulations, to infer the heating power dissipated by a three-dimensional model system consisting in emulsion microdroplets loaded with AuNPs. This approach gives access to the temperature reached in the core of droplets upon irradiation without need of extrinsic calibration. These quantitative results are validated qualitatively via the observation of the phase transition of a thermoresponsive polymer added in the droplet as an in situ thermal probe.

Furthermore, based on PD calculations, we obtain exact results for the order parameter distribution and Binder cumulants at the discontinuous melting transition.

We also give a precise quantitative version of this characterization in terms of the so-called Muckenhoupt exponent of $E$.

We assume deterministic loading, which means that the first measure is supported on a linear subspace. We additionally assume that the second measure is only known approximately through a sequence of empirical (discrete) measures.

In this work, we analyse and report an efficient visual method for assessing the viability of pollen using digital holographic microscopy (DHM). We test this method on pollen grains of the invasive Lantana camara, a well known plant invader known to most of the tropical world. We image pollen grains and show that the quantitative phase information provided by the DHM technique can be readily related to the chromatin content of the individual cells and thereby to pollen viability.

The temporal evolution of the surface profile is well described by the characteristic power law of capillary-driven surface flows. In all cases, the surface evolution of the as-deposited films and the rejuvenated films are enhanced compared to bulk and are not easily distinguishable from each other. The temperature dependence of the measured relaxation times determined from the surface evolution is found to be quantitatively comparable to similar studies for high molecular weight spincast polystyrene. Comparisons to numerical solutions of the glassy thin film equation provide quantitative estimates of the surface mobility.

These characterization procedures are yet time-consuming and inhibit efficiency in materials science workflows. The ever-increasing popularity and propulsion of data science techniques has provided an obvious solution on the course towards materials analysis automation. Deep learning has become a prime focus for predicting crystallographic parameters and features from X-ray spectra. However, the infeasibility of curating large, well-labelled experimental datasets means that one must resort to a large number of theoretic simulations for powder data augmentation to effectively train deep models. Herein, we are interested in conventional supervised learning algorithms in lieu of deep learning for multi-label crystalline phase identification and quantitative phase analysis for a biomedical application.

Nonlinear Equivariant Imaging: Learning Multi-Parametric Tissue Mapping   without Ground Truth for Compressive Quantitative MRI,"Ketan Fatania, Kwai Y. Chau, Carolin M. Pirkl, Marion I. Menzel, Peter Hall, Mohammad Golbabaee","Current state-of-the-art reconstruction for quantitative tissue maps from fast, compressive, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF), use supervised deep learning, with the drawback of requiring high-fidelity ground truth tissue map training data which is limited. This paper proposes NonLinear Equivariant Imaging (NLEI), a self-supervised learning approach to eliminate the need for ground truth for deep MRF image reconstruction. NLEI extends the recent Equivariant Imaging framework to nonlinear inverse problems such as MRF. Only fast, compressed-sampled MRF scans are used for training. NLEI learns tissue mapping using spatiotemporal priors: spatial priors are obtained from the invariance of MRF data to a group of geometric image transformations, while temporal priors are obtained from a nonlinear Bloch response model approximated by a pre-trained neural network. Tested retrospectively on two acquisition settings, we observe that NLEI (self-supervised learning) closely approaches the performance of supervised learning, despite not using ground truth during training.",2022-11-23T09:04:14Z,2022-11-23T09:04:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12786v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12786v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Domain generalization in fetal brain MRI segmentation \\with   multi-reconstruction augmentation,"Priscille de Dumast, Meritxell Bach Cuadra","Quantitative analysis of in utero human brain development is crucial for abnormal characterization. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation is therefore an asset for quantitative analysis. However, the development of automated segmentation methods is hampered by the scarce availability of fetal brain MRI annotated datasets and the limited variability within these cohorts. In this context, we propose to leverage the power of fetal brain MRI super-resolution (SR) reconstruction methods to generate multiple reconstructions of a single subject with different parameters, thus as an efficient tuning-free data augmentation strategy. Overall, the latter significantly improves the generalization of segmentation methods over SR pipelines.",2022-11-25T18:29:53Z,2022-11-25T18:29:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14282v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14282v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Quantitative Method for Security Situation of the Power Information   Network Based on the Evolutionary Neural Network,"Quande Yuan, Yuzhen Pi, Lei Kou, Fangfang Zhang, Bo Ye","Cybersecurity is the security cornerstone of digital transformation of the power grid and construction of new power systems. The traditional network security situation quantification method only analyzes from the perspective of network performance, ignoring the impact of various power application services on the security situation, so the quantification results cannot fully reflect the power information network risk state. This study proposes a method for quantifying security situation of the power information network based on the evolutionary neural network. First, the security posture system architecture is designed by analyzing the business characteristics of power information network applications. Second, combining the importance of power application business, the spatial element index system of coupled interconnection is established from three dimensions of network reliability, threat, and vulnerability. Then, the BP neural network optimized by the genetic evolutionary algorithm is incorporated into the element index calculation process, and the quantitative model of security posture of the power information network based on the evolutionary neural network is constructed. Finally, a simulation experiment environment is built according to a power sector network topology, and the effectiveness and robustness of the method proposed in the study are verified.",2022-11-26T01:05:35Z,2022-11-26T01:05:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14422v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14422v1,"cs.AI, 68T99, I.2"
Non-Coding RNAs Improve the Predictive Power of Network Medicine,"Deisy Morselli Gysi, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi","Network Medicine has improved the mechanistic understanding of disease, offering quantitative insights into disease mechanisms, comorbidities, and novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic treatments. Yet, most network-based approaches rely on a comprehensive map of protein-protein interactions, ignoring interactions mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Here, we systematically combine experimentally confirmed binding interactions mediated by ncRNA with protein-protein interactions, constructing the first comprehensive network of all physical interactions in the human cell. We find that the inclusion of ncRNA, expands the number of genes in the interactome by 46% and the number of interactions by 107%, significantly enhancing our ability to identify disease modules. Indeed, we find that 132 diseases, lacked a statistically significant disease module in the protein-based interactome, but have a statistically significant disease module after inclusion of ncRNA-mediated interactions, making these diseases accessible to the tools of network medicine. We show that the inclusion of ncRNAs helps unveil disease-disease relationships that were not detectable before and expands our ability to predict comorbidity patterns between diseases. Taken together, we find that including non-coding interactions improves both the breath and the predictive accuracy of network medicine.",2022-11-27T11:46:24Z,2022-11-27T11:46:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14800v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14800v1,"q-bio.MN, q-bio.QM, stat.AP"

Some of the motivating questions are: Are certain norms accumulating/concentrating on small scales near potential blow-up times? At what speed do certain scale-invariant norms blow-up? Can one prove explicit quantitative regularity estimates? Can one break the criticality barrier, even slightly? We emphasize that these questions are closely linked together.

Quantitative Besicovitch projection theorem for irregular sets of   directions,Damian Dąbrowski,"The classical Besicovitch projection theorem states that if a planar set $E$ with finite length is purely unrectifiable, then almost all orthogonal projections of $E$ have zero length. We prove a quantitative version of this result: if $E\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is AD-regular and there exists a set of direction $G\subset \mathbb{S}^1$ with $\mathcal{H}^1(G)\gtrsim 1$ such that for every $\theta\in G$ we have $\|\pi_\theta\mathcal{H}^1|_E\|_{L^{\infty}}\lesssim 1$, then a big piece of $E$ can be covered by a Lipschitz graph $\Gamma$ with $\mathrm{Lip}(\Gamma)\lesssim 1$. The main novelty of our result is that the set of good directions $G$ is assumed to be merely measurable and large in measure, while previous results of this kind required $G$ to be an arc. As a corollary, we obtain a result on AD-regular sets which avoid a large set of directions, in the sense that the set of directions they span has a large complement. It generalizes the following easy observation: a set $E$ is contained in some Lipschitz graph if and only if the complement of the set of directions spanned by $E$ contains an arc.",2022-11-30T11:19:06Z,2022-11-30T11:19:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16911v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.16911v1,"math.CA, 28A75 (primary) 28A78 (secondary)"

Initial Results for Pairwise Causal Discovery Using Quantitative   Information Flow,"Felipe Giori, Flavio Figueiredo","Pairwise Causal Discovery is the task of determining causal, anticausal, confounded or independence relationships from pairs of variables. Over the last few years, this challenging task has promoted not only the discovery of novel machine learning models aimed at solving the task, but also discussions on how learning the causal direction of variables may benefit machine learning overall. In this paper, we show that Quantitative Information Flow (QIF), a measure usually employed for measuring leakages of information from a system to an attacker, shows promising results as features for the task. In particular, experiments with real-world datasets indicate that QIF is statistically tied to the state of the art.

Here we explore links of the two for an arbitrary light field by performing a quantitative analysis of two optical coherence properties: polarization and entanglement (implied by a wave picture of light due to Huygens and Fresnel). A universal complementary identity relation is obtained. More surprisingly, optical polarization, entanglement, and their identity relation are shown to be quantitatively associated with mechanical concepts of center of mass and moment of inertia through the Huygens-Steiner theorem for rigid body rotation.

Efficient and Generic Algorithms for Quantitative Attack Tree Analysis,"Milan Lopuhaä-Zwakenberg, Carlos E.

These algorithms compute relevant security metrics, i.e. performance indicators that quantify how good the security of a system is; typical metrics being the most likely attack, the cheapest, or the most damaging one. However, existing methods are only geared towards specific metrics or do not work on general attack trees. This paper classifies attack trees in two dimensions: proper trees vs. directed acyclic graphs (i.e. with shared subtrees); and static vs. dynamic gates. For three out of these four classes, we propose novel algorithms that work over a generic attribute domain, encompassing a large number of concrete security metrics defined on the attack tree semantics; dynamic attack trees with directed acyclic graph structure are left as an open problem.

One way to get DNNs to explain their reasoning for prediction is via attribution methods which are assumed to highlight the parts of the input that contribute to the prediction the most. Given the existence of numerous attribution methods and a lack of quantitative results on the fidelity of those methods, selection of an attribution method for sequence-based tasks has been mostly done qualitatively. In this work, we take a step towards identifying the most faithful attribution method by proposing a computational approach that utilizes point mutations.

Addressing the problem, the temporal variation measure analysis is presented to describe distribution patterns of scatter points in the second-order difference plot quantitatively and extract the acceleration information for variation of heart rate variability.

Markov Categories and Entropy,Paolo Perrone,"Markov categories are a novel framework to describe and treat problems in probability and information theory.   In this work we combine the categorical formalism with the traditional quantitative notions of entropy, mutual information, and data processing inequalities. We show that several quantitative aspects of information theory can be captured by an enriched version of Markov categories, where the spaces of morphisms are equipped with a divergence or even a metric.   As it is customary in information theory, mutual information can be defined as a measure of how far a joint source is from displaying independence of its components.   More strikingly, Markov categories give a notion of determinism for sources and channels, and we can define entropy exactly by measuring how far a source or channel is from being deterministic. This recovers Shannon and R\'enyi entropies, as well as the Gini-Simpson index used in ecology to quantify diversity, and it can be used to give a conceptual definition of generalized entropy.",2022-12-22T14:12:35Z,2023-10-25T10:28:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11719v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11719v2,"cs.IT, cs.LO, math.CT, math.IT, math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, 18D20, 18M35, 60A05, 62A09, 68Q55, 94A17"

We next obtain rates of convergence for the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem for non-divergence form operators, which are generically optimal for $d\geq 3$ and nearly optimal when $d=2$. Furthermore, we establish the existence, stationarity and uniqueness properties of the corrector problem for all dimensions $d\ge 2$.

By exploiting spectral multiplexing and optical transfer function engineering, three color-coded intensity images of a sample with three optimized illuminations were simultaneously obtained in a single-shot measurement. The measured intensity images were then deconvoluted to obtain the RI image of the in-focus slice of the sample. As a proof of concept, a setup was built using Fresnel lenses and a liquid-crystal display.

Classical psychophysical methods have helped uncover many rules of human perceptual segmentation, and recent progress in machine learning has produced successful algorithms. Yet, the computational logic of human segmentation remains unclear, partially because we lack well-controlled paradigms to measure perceptual segmentation maps and compare models quantitatively. Here we propose a new, integrated approach: given an image, we measure multiple pixel-based same--different judgments and perform model--based reconstruction of the underlying segmentation map. The reconstruction is robust to several experimental manipulations and captures the variability of individual participants. We demonstrate the validity of the approach on human segmentation of natural images and composite textures. We show that image uncertainty affects measured human variability, and it influences how participants weigh different visual features.

"Quantifying tissue growth, shape and collision via continuum models and   Bayesian inference","Carles Falcó, Daniel J. Cohen, José A. Carrillo, Ruth E. Baker","Although tissues are usually studied in isolation, this situation rarely occurs in biology, as cells, tissues, and organs, coexist and interact across scales to determine both shape and function. Here, we take a quantitative approach combining data from recent experiments, mathematical modelling, and Bayesian parameter inference, to describe the self-assembly of multiple epithelial sheets by growth and collision. We use two simple and well-studied continuum models, where cells move either randomly or following population pressure gradients. After suitable calibration, both models prove to be practically identifiable, and can reproduce the main features of single tissue expansions. However, our findings reveal that whenever tissue-tissue interactions become relevant, the random motion assumption can lead to unrealistic behaviour. Under this setting, a model accounting for population pressure from different cell populations is more appropriate and shows a better agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, we discuss how tissue shape and pressure affect multi-tissue collisions. Our work thus provides a systematic approach to quantify and predict complex tissue configurations with applications in the design of tissue composites and more generally in tissue engineering.",2023-02-06T17:58:18Z,2023-02-06T17:58:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02968v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02968v1,"q-bio.TO, nlin.PS, q-bio.QM"
Quantification of the Writhe Number Evolution of Solar Filament Axes,"Zhenjun Zhou, Chaowei Jiang, Hongqiang Song, Yuming Wang, Yongqiang Hao, Jun Cui","Solar filament eruptions often show complex and dramatic geometric deformation that is highly relevant to the underlying physical mechanism triggering the eruptions. It has been well known that the writhe of filament axes is a key parameter characterizing its global geometric deformation, but a quantitative investigation of the development of writhe during its eruption is still lacking. Here we introduce the Writhe Application Toolkit (WAT) which can be used to characterize accurately the topology of filament axes. This characterization is achieved based on the reconstruction and writhe number computation of three-dimensional paths of the filament axes from dual-perspective observations. We apply this toolkit to four dextral filaments located in the northern hemisphere with a counterclockwise (CCW) rotation during their eruptions. Initially, all these filaments possess a small writhe number (=<0.20) indicating a weak helical deformation of the axes. As the CCW rotation kicks in, their writhe numbers begin to decrease and reach large negative values.

Automatic and quantitative measurement of spectrometer aberrations,"Yueming Guo, Andrew R. Lupini","The performance of electron energy-loss spectrometers can often be limited by their electron-optical aberrations. Due to recent developments in high energy-resolution and momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), there is renewed interest in optimizing the performance of such spectrometers. For example, the ""{\omega}-q"" mode of momentum-resolved EELS, which uses a small convergence angle and requires aligning diffraction spots with a slot aperture, presents a challenge for realigning the spectrometer after adjusting the projection lenses. Automated and robust alignment can greatly benefit such a process. The first step towards this goal is automatic and quantitative measurement of spectrometer aberrations. Here we demonstrate the measurement of geometric aberrations and distortions in EELS within a monochromated scanning transmission electron microscope(STEM). To better understand the results, we present a wave mechanical simulation of the experiment. Using the measured aberration and distortion coefficients as inputs to the simulation, we find a good match between the simulation and experiment, verifying the approach used in the simulation, allowing us to assess the accuracy of the measurements. Understanding the errors and inaccuracies in the procedure can guide further progress in aberration measurement and correction for new spectrometer developments.",2023-02-24T22:42:32Z,2023-02-24T22:42:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12922v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12922v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.optics"
Quantitative causality analysis with coarsely sampled time series,X. San Liang,"The information flow-based quantitative causality analysis has been widely applied in different disciplines because of its origin from first principles, its concise form, and its computational efficiency. So far the algorithm for its estimation is based on differential dynamical systems, which, however, may make an issue for coarsely sampled time series. Here, we show that for linear systems, this is fine at least qualitatively; but for highly nonlinear systems, the bias increases significantly as the sampling frequency is reduced. This paper provides a partial solution to this problem, showing how causality analysis is assured faithful with coarsely sampled series when, of course, the statistics is sufficient. An explicit and concise formula has been obtained, with only sample covariances involved. It has been successfully applied to a system comprising of a pair of coupled R\""ossler oscillators. Particularly remarkable is the success when the two oscillators are nearly synchronized.",2023-02-13T02:00:02Z,2023-03-07T02:53:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03113v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03113v2,"nlin.AO, nlin.CD, physics.data-an"
Resolving quantitative MRI model degeneracy with machine learning via   training data distribution design,"Michele Guerreri, Sean Epstein, Hojjat Azadbakht, Hui Zhang","Quantitative MRI (qMRI) aims to map tissue properties non-invasively via models that relate these unknown quantities to measured MRI signals. Estimating these unknowns, which has traditionally required model fitting - an often iterative procedure, can now be done with one-shot machine learning (ML) approaches. Such parameter estimation may be complicated by intrinsic qMRI signal model degeneracy: different combinations of tissue properties produce the same signal. Despite their many advantages, it remains unclear whether ML approaches can resolve this issue. Growing empirical evidence appears to suggest ML approaches remain susceptible to model degeneracy. Here we demonstrate under the right circumstances ML can address this issue. Inspired by recent works on the impact of training data distributions on ML-based parameter estimation, we propose to resolve model degeneracy by designing training data distributions. We put forward a classification of model degeneracies and identify one particular kind of degeneracies amenable to the proposed attack. The strategy is demonstrated successfully using the Revised NODDI model with standard multi-shell diffusion MRI data as an exemplar. Our results illustrate the importance of training set design which has the potential to allow accurate estimation of tissue properties with ML.",2023-03-09T18:10:45Z,2023-03-09T18:10:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05464v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05464v1,"physics.med-ph, cs.LG"
Some measure rigidity and equidistribution results for $β$-maps,Nevo Fishbein,We prove $\times a$ $\times b$ measure rigidity for multiplicatively independent pairs when $a\in\mathbb{N}$ and $b>1$ is a ``specified'' real number (the $b$-expansion of $1$ has a tail or bounded runs of $0$'s) under a positive entropy condition. This is done by proving a mean decay of the Fourier series of the point masses average along $\times b$ orbits. We also prove a quantitative version of this decay under stronger conditions on the $\times a$ invariant measure. The quantitative version together with the $\times b$ invariance of the limit measure is a step toward a general Host-type pointwise equidistribution theorem in which the equidistribution is for Parry measure instead of Lebesgue. We show that finite memory length measures on the $a$-shift meet the mentioned conditions for mean convergence. Our main proof relies on techniques of Hochman.,2023-03-19T09:10:55Z,2023-03-19T09:10:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10609v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10609v1,"math.DS, 28D05 (Primary) 11A63 (Secondary)"
Probabilistic evolution of the error of numerical method for linear   stochastic differential equation,"Jialin Hong, Ge Liang, Derui Sheng","The quantitative characterization of the evolution of the error distribution (as the step-size tends to zero) is a fundamental problem in the analysis of stochastic numerical method. In this paper, we answer this problem by proving that the error of numerical method for linear stochastic differential equation satisfies the limit theorems and large deviation principle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the quantitative characterization of the evolution of the error distribution of stochastic numerical method. As an application, we provide a new perspective to explain the superiority of symplectic methods for stochastic Hamiltonian systems in the long-time computation. To be specific, by taking the linear stochastic oscillator as the test equation, we show that in the long-time computation, the probability that the error deviates from the typical value is smaller for the symplectic methods than that for the non-symplectic methods, which reveals that the stochastic symplectic methods are more stable than non-symplectic methods.",2023-04-04T07:45:29Z,2023-08-11T13:04:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01602v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01602v2,"math.NA, cs.NA"
Local Conditions for Global Convergence of Gradient Flows and Proximal   Point Sequences in Metric Spaces,"Lorenzo Dello Schiavo, Jan Maas, Francesco Pedrotti","This paper deals with local criteria for the convergence to a global minimiser for gradient flow trajectories and their discretisations. To obtain quantitative estimates on the speed of convergence, we consider variations on the classical Kurdyka--{\L}ojasiewicz inequality for a large class of parameter functions. Our assumptions are given in terms of the initial data, without any reference to an equilibrium point. The main results are convergence statements for gradient flow curves and proximal point sequences to a global minimiser, together with sharp quantitative estimates on the speed of convergence. These convergence results apply in the general setting of lower semicontinuous functionals on complete metric spaces, generalising recent results for smooth functionals on $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Bayesian D-Optimal Design of Experiments with Quantitative and   Qualitative Responses,"Lulu Kang, Xinwei Deng, Ran Jin","Systems with both quantitative and qualitative responses are widely encountered in many applications. Design of experiment methods are needed when experiments are conducted to study such systems. Classic experimental design methods are unsuitable here because they often focus on one type of response. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian D-optimal design method for experiments with one continuous and one binary response. Both noninformative and conjugate informative prior distributions on the unknown parameters are considered. The proposed design criterion has meaningful interpretations regarding the D-optimality for the models for both types of responses. An efficient point-exchange search algorithm is developed to construct the local D-optimal designs for given parameter values. Global D-optimal designs are obtained by accumulating the frequencies of the design points in local D-optimal designs, where the parameters are sampled from the prior distributions.

In contrast to the cases studied in the aforementioned two papers, a usual PET induction argument does not give Gowers norm control over multidimensional progressions that involve polynomials of the same degrees. The main challenge is therefore to obtain Gowers norm control, and we accomplish this for all multidimensional polynomial progressions with pairwise independent polynomials. The key inputs are: (1) a quantitative version of a PET induction scheme developed in ergodic theory by Donoso, Koutsogiannis, Ferr\'e-Moragues and Sun, (2) a quantitative concatenation result for Gowers box norms in arbitrary finite abelian groups, motivated by earlier results of Tao, Ziegler, Peluse and Prendiville; (3) an adaptation to combinatorics of the box norm smoothing technique, recently developed in the ergodic setting by the author and Frantzikinakis; and (4) a new version of the multidimensional degree lowering argument.",2023-04-21T07:59:14Z,2024-04-23T08:09:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10793v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10793v2,"math.CO, math.NT, 11B30"

We analyze the global Twitter discourse on this event over a three week window around the collapse date over the years $2013$ to $2022$ by a mixture of network-theoretic quantitative and discourse-theoretic qualitative methods. In particular, key communicators and the community structure of the discourse participants are identified using a multilayer network modeling approach and the interpretative patterns of the key communicator's tweets of all years are analyzed using the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse. This combination of quantitative and qualitative methods reveals that the discourse is separated into three phases: reporting, reprocessing, and commemoration. These phases can be identified by the temporal evolution, network-structural properties, and the contentual analysis of the discourse. After the negotiation of the interpretative framework in the reprocessing phase, subsequent years are characterized by its commemorative repetition as well as resulting demands by different international actor groups despite highly fluctuating participants.",2023-04-28T09:21:51Z,2023-08-28T09:49:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14706v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14706v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI"

Emergent structural correlations in dense liquids,"Ilian Pihlajamaa, Corentin C. L. Laudicina, Chengjie Luo, Liesbeth M. C.

Most studies to date focus solely on two-body structural correlations, and only a handful of papers have sought to consider additional three-body correlations. Here, we go beyond the state of the art by extracting many-body static structure factors from molecular dynamics simulations and by deriving accurate approximations up to the six-body structure factor via density functional theory. We find that supercooling manifestly increases four-body correlations, akin to the two- and three-body case. However, at small wave numbers, we observe that the four-point structure of a liquid drastically changes upon supercooling, both qualitatively and quantitatively, which is not the case in two-point structural correlations.

This result, which holds in the idealized, noiseless scenario, indicates that costly concentration measurements from blood samples in quantitative PET imaging can be avoided in principle.

While such a rigidity statement turns out to be false for maps of general degree, we will prove that any map $v$ with small energy defect is essentially given by a collection of rational maps that describe the behaviour of $v$ at very different scales and that the corresponding distance is controlled by a quantitative rigidity estimate of the form $dist^2\leq C \delta_v(1+\vert\log\delta_v\vert)$ which is indeed sharp.",2023-05-26T15:53:30Z,2023-05-26T15:53:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17045v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17045v1,"math.AP, math.DG, 53C43, 58E20, 30C70, 26D10,"

Our approach is based on a perturbative and discrete version of the modified entropy method developed to establish hypocoercivity for the continuous-time kinetic Langevin process. As a corollary of our main result, we are able to derive complexity bounds for the class of algorithms at hand. In particular, we show that the total number of iterations to achieve a target accuracy $\varepsilon >0$ is of order $d/\varepsilon^{1/4}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem.

To be more precise, let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{d}$ be the preimage of a sphere $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ under the natural embedding from $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. We showed that if a rational polynomial sequence $(g(n)\Gamma)_{n\in\Omega}$ is not equidistributed on a nilmanifold $G/\Gamma$, then there exists a nontrivial horizontal character $\eta$ of $G/\Gamma$ such that $\eta\circ g \mod \mathbb{Z}$ vanishes on $\Omega$.   We also prove quantitative equidistribution and factorization theorems for more general sets arising from quadratic forms defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. These results will serve as fundamental tools in later parts of the series to proof the spherical Gowers inverse theorem and the geometric Ramsey conjecture.",2023-12-11T18:58:27Z,2024-07-26T01:56:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06651v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06651v3,"math.NT, math.DS, 11T99, 37A99"

TABSurfer: a Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for Subcortical   Segmentation,"Aaron Cao, Vishwanatha M. Rao, Kejia Liu, Xinru Liu, Andrew F. Laine, Jia Guo","Subcortical segmentation remains challenging despite its important applications in quantitative structural analysis of brain MRI scans. The most accurate method, manual segmentation, is highly labor intensive, so automated tools like FreeSurfer have been adopted to handle this task. However, these traditional pipelines are slow and inefficient for processing large datasets. In this study, we propose TABSurfer, a novel 3D patch-based CNN-Transformer hybrid deep learning model designed for superior subcortical segmentation compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. To evaluate, we first demonstrate TABSurfer's consistent performance across various T1w MRI datasets with significantly shorter processing times compared to FreeSurfer. Then, we validate against manual segmentations, where TABSurfer outperforms FreeSurfer based on the manual ground truth. In each test, we also establish TABSurfer's advantage over a leading deep learning benchmark, FastSurferVINN. Together, these studies highlight TABSurfer's utility as a powerful tool for fully automated subcortical segmentation with high fidelity.",2023-12-13T16:29:28Z,2023-12-13T16:29:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08267v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08267v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, q-bio.QM"

Additional $B_1^+$ and $B_0$ calibration scans can mitigate this but add scan time and cannot be applied retrospectively to previously collected data. Here, we proposed a calibration-free sequence-adaptive deep-learning framework, to estimate and correct for $B_1^+$ and $B_0$ effects of any MRF sequence. We demonstrate its capability on arbitrary MRF sequences at 3T, where no training data were previously obtained. Such approach can be applied to any previously-acquired and future MRF-scans.

In this study, we propose a nanowire-supported bridging method based on an optical microscope-based nanomanipulation technique to quantitatively measure the adhesion energy between nanolayers and substrates. Using this innovative approach, we conducted adhesion energy measurements between mica nanolayers and Si substrates, revealing a value of approximately 110 J/m2. Additionally, we discuss the applicable conditions of this new method. The proposed technique allows measurements in atmospheric conditions and is, in principle, applicable to all types of nanolayers and substrates.

Bias-Reduced Neural Networks for Parameter Estimation in Quantitative   MRI,"Andrew Mao, Sebastian Flassbeck, Jakob Assländer","Purpose: To develop neural network (NN)-based quantitative MRI parameter estimators with minimal bias and a variance close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound.   Theory and Methods: We generalize the mean squared error loss to control the bias and variance of the NN's estimates, which involves averaging over multiple noise realizations of the same measurements during training. Bias and variance properties of the resulting NNs are studied for two neuroimaging applications.   Results: In simulations, the proposed strategy reduces the estimates' bias throughout parameter space and achieves a variance close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound. In vivo, we observe good concordance between parameter maps estimated with the proposed NNs and traditional estimators, such as non-linear least-squares fitting, while state-of-the-art NNs show larger deviations.   Conclusion: The proposed NNs have greatly reduced bias compared to those trained using the mean squared error and offer significantly improved computational efficiency over traditional estimators with comparable or better accuracy.",2023-11-13T20:41:48Z,2024-04-10T15:58:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11468v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11468v3,"physics.med-ph, cs.CV"
Quantitative comparison of cell-cell detachment force in different   experimental setups,"Amit Singh Vishen, Jacques Prost, Pierre Sens",We compare three different setups for measuring cell-cell adhesion. We show that the measured strength depends on the type of setup that is used. For identical cells different assays measure different detachment forces. This can be understood from the fact that cell-cell detachment is a global property of the system. We also analyse the role of external force and line tension on contact angle and cell-cell detachment. Comparison with experiment suggests that the current data are essentially dynamical in nature.

Sharp weighted inequalities for iterated commutators of a class of   multilinear operators,"Jiawei Tan, Qingying Xue","In this paper, the sharp quantitative weighted bounds for the iterated commutators of a class of multilinear operators were systematically studied. This class of operators contains multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators, multilinear Fourier integral operators, and multilinear Littlewood-Paley square operators as its typical examples. These were done only under two pretty much general assumptions of pointwise sparse domination estimates. We first established local decay estimates and quantitative weak $A_\infty$ decay estimates for iterated commutators of this class of operators. Then, we considered the corresponding Coifman-Fefferman inequalities and the mixed weak type estimates associated with Sawyer's conjecture. Beyond that, the Fefferman-Stein inequalities with respect to arbitrary weights and weighted modular inequalities were also given. As applications, it was shown that all the conclusions aforementioned can be applied to multilinear $\omega$-Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators, multilinear maximal singular integral operators, multilinear pseudo-differential operators, Stein's square functions, and higher order Calder\'{o}n commutators.",2024-01-03T12:41:14Z,2024-01-03T12:41:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01714v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01714v1,"math.CA, 42B20, 42B25"

The developed method combines the relative entropy method under the moderated interaction scaling introduced by Oeschl\""ager, and the propagation of chaos in probability. The result includes the case that the interaction force does not need to be a potential field. Furthermore, if the interaction force is a potential field, with a convolutional structure, then the developed estimate also provides the modulated energy estimates.

Scaled quadratic variation for controlled rough paths and parameter   estimation of fractional diffusions,"James-Michael Leahy, Torstein Nilssen","We introduce the concept of finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation along a sequence of partitions for paths on a given interval. This concept, with historical roots in the study of Gaussian processes by Gladyshev (1961) and Klein \& Gin\'e (1975), includes the fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with Hurst index $H$, which has finite $1-2H$-scaled quadratic variation. We show that a path that is controlled by a path with finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation in the sense of M. Gubinelli inherits this property, and the corresponding scaled quadratic variation satisfies an It\^o-isometry type formula. Moreover, we prove quantitative error bounds that establish a relationship between the convergence rates of the scaled quadratic variation of the controlled path and that of the controlling path. Additionally, we introduce a consistent estimator for the parameter $\gamma$ based on a single sample path, complete with quantitative error bounds. We apply these results to the parameter estimation for fractional diffusions.

PERMUTOOLS: A MATLAB Package for Multivariate Permutation Testing,"Michael J. Crosse, John J.

Advancements in computer processing power have greatly improved the capability of statistical inference through the availability of resampling methods. However, many of the statistical practices used today are based on traditional, parametric methods that rely on assumptions about the underlying population. These assumptions may not always be valid, leading to inaccurate results and misleading interpretations. Permutation testing, on the other hand, generates the sampling distribution empirically by permuting the observed data, providing distribution-free hypothesis testing. Furthermore, this approach lends itself to a powerful method for multiple comparison correction - known as max correction - which is less prone to type II errors than conventional correction methods. Parametric methods have also traditionally been utilized for estimating the confidence interval of various test statistics and effect size measures. However, these too can be estimated empirically using permutation or bootstrapping techniques. Whilst resampling methods are generally considered preferable, many popular programming languages and statistical software packages lack efficient implementations.

Subsequently, we summarize relevant machine learning methodologies and discuss an emerging paradigm which we call dimensional neuroimaging endophenotype (DNE). DNE dissects the neurobiological heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders into a low dimensional yet informative, quantitative brain phenotypic representation, serving as a robust intermediate phenotype (i.e., endophenotype) largely reflecting underlying genetics and etiology.

GPU Acceleration of a Conjugate Exponential Model for Cancer Tissue   Heterogeneity,"Anik Chaudhuri, Anwoy Mohanty, Manoranjan Satpathy","Heterogeneity in the cell population of cancer tissues poses many challenges in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Studying the heterogeneity in cell populations from gene expression measurement data in the context of cancer research is a problem of paramount importance. In addition, reducing the computation time of the algorithms that deal with high volumes of data has its obvious merits. Parallelizable models using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are typically slow. This paper shows a novel, computationally efficient, and parallelizable model to analyze heterogeneity in cancer tissues using GPUs. Because our model is parallelizable, the input data size does not affect the computation time much, provided the hardware resources are not exhausted. Our model uses qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) gene expression measurements to study heterogeneity in cancer tissue. We compute the cell proportion breakup by accelerating variational methods on a GPU. We test this model on synthetic and real-world gene expression data collected from fibroblasts and compare the performance of our algorithm with those of MCMC and Expectation Maximization.

A high contrast and resolution reconstruction algorithm in quantitative   photoacoustic tomography,"Anwesa Dey, Alfio Borzi, Souvik Roy",A framework for reconstruction of optical diffusion and absorption coefficients in quantitative photoacoustic tomography is presented. This framework is based on a Tikhonov-type functional with a regularization term promoting sparsity of the absorption coefficient and a prior involving a Kubelka-Munk absorption-diffusion relation that allows to obtain superior reconstructions. The reconstruction problem is formulated as the minimization of this functional subject to the differential constraint given by a photon-propagation model. The solution of this problem is obtained by a fast and robust sequential quadratic hamiltonian algorithm based on the Pontryagin maximum principle. Results of several numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed computational strategy is able to obtain reconstructions of the optical coefficients with high contrast and resolution for a wide variety of objects.,2024-01-31T03:20:21Z,2024-01-31T03:20:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17569v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17569v1,"math.OC, cs.NA, math.NA, 35R30, 49J20, 49K20, 65M08, 82C31"

Using tools from stochastic differential geometry we show that, in the small learning rate regime, RSGD can be approximated by the solution to the RSMF driven by an infinite-dimensional Wiener process. The RSMF accounts for the random fluctuations of RSGD and, thereby, increases the order of approximation compared to the deterministic Riemannian gradient flow.

Quantitative Metrics for Benchmarking Medical Image Harmonization,"Abhijeet Parida, Zhifan Jiang, Roger J. Packer, Robert A. Avery, Syed M. Anwar, Marius G.

However, benchmarking the effectiveness of harmonization techniques has been a challenge due to the lack of widely available standardized datasets with ground truths. In this context, we propose three metrics: two intensity harmonization metrics and one anatomy preservation metric for medical images during harmonization, where no ground truths are required. Through extensive studies on a dataset with available harmonization ground truth, we demonstrate that our metrics are correlated with established image quality assessment metrics.

Linear combinations of cluster mean-field states applied to spin systems,"Athanasios Papastathopoulos-Katsaros, Thomas M. Henderson, Gustavo E. Scuseria","We present an innovative cluster-based method employing linear combinations of diverse cluster mean-field (cMF) states, and apply it to describe the ground state of strongly-correlated spin systems. In cluster mean-field theory, the ground state wavefunction is expressed as a factorized tensor product of optimized cluster states. While our prior work concentrated on a single cMF tiling, this study removes that constraint by combining different tilings of cMF states. Selection criteria, including translational symmetry and spatial proximity, guide this process. We present benchmark calculations for the one- and two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ and $XXZ$ Heisenberg models. Our findings highlight two key aspects. First, the method offers a semi-quantitative description of the $0.4 \lessapprox J_2/J_1 \lessapprox 0.6$ regime of the $J_1-J_2$ model - a particularly challenging regime for existing methods. Second, our results demonstrate the capability of our method to provide qualitative descriptions for all the models and regimes considered, establishing it as a valuable reference. However, the inclusion of additional (weak) correlations is necessary for quantitative agreement, and we explore methods to incorporate these extra correlations.",2024-02-09T19:47:28Z,2024-05-02T15:42:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06760v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06760v2,"cond-mat.str-el, physics.chem-ph"
Nonlinear spiked covariance matrices and signal propagation in deep   neural networks,"Zhichao Wang, Denny Wu, Zhou Fan","Many recent works have studied the eigenvalue spectrum of the Conjugate Kernel (CK) defined by the nonlinear feature map of a feedforward neural network. However, existing results only establish weak convergence of the empirical eigenvalue distribution, and fall short of providing precise quantitative characterizations of the ''spike'' eigenvalues and eigenvectors that often capture the low-dimensional signal structure of the learning problem. In this work, we characterize these signal eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a nonlinear version of the spiked covariance model, including the CK as a special case. Using this general result, we give a quantitative description of how spiked eigenstructure in the input data propagates through the hidden layers of a neural network with random weights. As a second application, we study a simple regime of representation learning where the weight matrix develops a rank-one signal component over training and characterize the alignment of the target function with the spike eigenvector of the CK on test data.",2024-02-15T17:31:19Z,2024-02-15T17:31:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10127v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10127v1,"stat.ML, cs.LG, math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH"
"Quantitative causality, causality-guided scientific discovery, and   causal machine learning","X. San Liang, Dake Chen, Renhe Zhang","It has been said, arguably, that causality analysis should pave a promising way to interpretable deep learning and generalization. Incorporation of causality into artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, however, is challenged with its vagueness, non-quantitiveness, computational inefficiency, etc. During the past 18 years, these challenges have been essentially resolved, with the establishment of a rigorous formalism of causality analysis initially motivated from atmospheric predictability. This not only opens a new field in the atmosphere-ocean science, namely, information flow, but also has led to scientific discoveries in other disciplines, such as quantum mechanics, neuroscience, financial economics, etc., through various applications. This note provides a brief review of the decade-long effort, including a list of major theoretical results, a sketch of the causal deep learning framework, and some representative real-world applications in geoscience pertaining to this journal, such as those on the anthropogenic cause of global warming, the decadal prediction of El Ni\~no Modoki, the forecasting of an extreme drought in China, among others.",2024-02-20T23:38:46Z,2024-02-20T23:38:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13427v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13427v1,"cs.AI, physics.data-an"
Perturbative criteria for the ergodicity of interacting dissipative   quantum lattice systems,"Lorenzo Bertini, Alberto De Sole, Gustavo Posta, Carlo Presilla","We introduce a class of quantum Markov semigroups describing the evolution of interacting quantum lattice systems, specified either as generic qudits or as fermions. The corresponding generators, which include both conservative and dissipative evolutions, are given by the superposition of local generators in the Lindblad form. Under general conditions, we show that the associated infinite volume dynamics is well defined and can be obtained as the strong limit of the finite volume dynamics. By regarding the interacting evolution as a perturbation of a non-interacting dissipative dynamics, we further obtain a quantitative criterion that yields the ergodicity of the quantum Markov semigroup together with the exponential convergence of local observables. The analysis is based on suitable a priori bounds on the resolvent equation which yield quantitive estimates on the evolution of local observables.",2024-02-23T18:27:23Z,2024-02-23T18:27:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15488v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15488v1,"math-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math.MP, 81S22, 82C10, 81V74, 47B44"

We show that, depending on the utilized supplier and solution the number and quality of the emitters changes. We perform a comprehensive optical characterization of the deposited nanoflakes to assess the quality of the generated SPEs. We show quantitative data on SPE yields, highlighting significant variations among solvents and different sources of hBN.

Quantitative homogenization for log-normal coefficients via Malliavin   calculus: the one-dimensional case,"Antoine Gloria, Siguang Qi","The quantitative analysis of stochastic homogenization problems has been a very active field in the last fifteen years. Whereas the first results were motivated by applied questions (namely, the numerical approximation of homogenized coefficients), the more recent achievements in the field are much more analytically-driven and focus on the subtle interplay between PDE analysis (and in particular elliptic regularity theory) and probability (concentration, stochastic cancellations, scaling limits). The aim of this article is threefold. First we provide a complete and self-contained analysis for the popular example of log-normal coefficients with possibly fat tails in dimension $d=1$, establishing new results on the accuracy of the two-scale expansion and characterizing fluctuations (in the perspective of uncertainty quantification). Second, we work in a context where explicit formulas allow us to by-pass analytical difficulties and therefore mostly focus on the probabilistic side of the theory. Last, the one-dimensional setting gives intuition on the available results in higher dimension (provided results are correctly reformulated) to which we give precise entries to the recent literature.",2024-02-29T14:03:03Z,2024-02-29T14:03:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19182v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19182v1,"math.AP, math.PR, 35R60, 35B27, 35B65, 60H07"
Ploutos: Towards interpretable stock movement prediction with financial   large language model,"Hanshuang Tong, Jun Li, Ning Wu, Ming Gong, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new pathways for many domains. However, the full potential of LLMs in financial investments remains largely untapped. There are two main challenges for typical deep learning-based methods for quantitative finance. First, they struggle to fuse textual and numerical information flexibly for stock movement prediction. Second, traditional methods lack clarity and interpretability, which impedes their application in scenarios where the justification for predictions is essential. To solve the above challenges, we propose Ploutos, a novel financial LLM framework that consists of PloutosGen and PloutosGPT. The PloutosGen contains multiple primary experts that can analyze different modal data, such as text and numbers, and provide quantitative strategies from different perspectives. Then PloutosGPT combines their insights and predictions and generates interpretable rationales. To generate accurate and faithful rationales, the training strategy of PloutosGPT leverage rearview-mirror prompting mechanism to guide GPT-4 to generate rationales, and a dynamic token weighting mechanism to finetune LLM by increasing key tokens weight.

Our results hold for a wide class of possibly time-dependent interactions, which are only assumed to satisfy a Besov-type regularity, related to the Hurst parameter $H\in (0,+\infty)\setminus \mathbb{N}$ of the driving noises.

QSMDiff: Unsupervised 3D Diffusion Models for Quantitative   Susceptibility Mapping,"Zhuang Xiong, Wei Jiang, Yang Gao, Feng Liu, Hongfu Sun","Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) dipole inversion is an ill-posed inverse problem for quantifying magnetic susceptibility distributions from MRI tissue phases. While supervised deep learning methods have shown success in specific QSM tasks, their generalizability across different acquisition scenarios remains constrained. Recent developments in diffusion models have demonstrated potential for solving 2D medical imaging inverse problems. However, their application to 3D modalities, such as QSM, remains challenging due to high computational demands. In this work, we developed a 3D image patch-based diffusion model, namely QSMDiff, for robust QSM reconstruction across different scan parameters, alongside simultaneous super-resolution and image-denoising tasks. QSMDiff adopts unsupervised 3D image patch training and full-size measurement guidance during inference for controlled image generation. Evaluation on simulated and in-vivo human brains, using gradient-echo and echo-planar imaging sequences across different acquisition parameters, demonstrates superior performance.

Mechanochemical bistability of intestinal organoids enables robust   morphogenesis,"Shi-Lei Xue, Qiutan Yang, Prisca Liberali, Edouard Hannezo","How pattern and form are generated in a reproducible manner during embryogenesis remains poorly understood. Intestinal organoid morphogenesis involves a number of mechanochemical regulators, including cell-type specific cytoskeletal forces and osmotically-driven lumen volume changes. However, whether and how these forces are coordinated in time and space via feedbacks to ensure robust morphogenesis remains unclear. Here, we propose a minimal physical model of organoid morphogenesis with local cellular mechano-sensation, where lumen volume changes can impact epithelial shape via both direct mechanical (passive) and indirect mechanosensitive (active) mechanisms. We show how mechano-sensitive feedbacks on cytoskeletal tension generically give rise to morphological bistability, where both bulged (open) and budded (closed) crypt states are possible and dependent on the history of volume changes. Such bistability can explain several paradoxical experimental observations, such as the importance of the timing of lumen shrinkage and robustness of the final morphogenetic state to mechanical perturbations. More quantitatively, we performed mechanical and pharmacological experiments to validate the key modelling assumptions and make quantitative predictions on organoid morphogenesis. This suggests that bistability arising from feedbacks between cellular tensions and fluid pressure could be a general mechanism to allow for the coordination of multicellular shape changes in developing systems.",2024-03-29T00:53:15Z,2024-03-29T00:53:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19900v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19900v1,"q-bio.TO, physics.app-ph, physics.bio-ph"

Prior knowledge networks (PKNs), the search space of historical patents, were constructed, representative search rules were formulated for R&D agents, and measures for knowledge search cost were designed to serve as search objectives. Simulation results in the field of photolithographic technology show that search costs differ significantly with different search rules. Familiarity and Degree rules significantly outperform BFS, DFS and Recency rules in terms of knowledge search costs, and are less affected by the size and density of PKNs. Interestingly, there is no significant correlation between the mean and variance of search costs and patent value, indicating that high-value patents are not particularly difficult to obtain.

All our results are quantitative and, in particular, we obtain fine estimates on the continuity of the solutions and the oscillation of the free interface (in terms of the modulus of continuity of the normal vector of the fixed boundary), even in the case of domains with low (Dini-type) regularity. Our analysis is based on an Almgren-type monotonicity formula at boundary points and an epiperimetric inequality at points of low frequency, which, together, yield an explicit rate of convergence for blow-up sequences and the boundary strong unique continuation property. Exploiting our quantitative blow-up analysis, we manage to prove clean-up results near one-phase and two-phase points.

A complete closed loop system model of the WEC is derived first, then three quantitative rules are obtained from analyzing the model. These rules are used to tune the $LC$ network, and hence the reactive PTO force that drives the WEC, to resonate with the input wave force and generate maximal electric power over a range of wave frequencies. Mathematical analysis of the WEC and tuning rules reveals the analytical and quantitative descriptions of the WEC's mechanical power absorption, active and reactive electric power generation and power factor, optimal electric resistance load, and the generator and $LC$ capacity requirements.

QSPR Analysis with Curvilinear Regression Modeling and Temperature-based   Topological Indices,H. M.

The main goal of QSPR studies is to find a mathematical relationship between the property of interest and several molecular descriptors derived from the structure of the molecule. Topological indices are the molecular descriptors that characterize the formation of chemical compounds and predict certain physicochemical properties. In this study, the QSPR models are designed using certain temperature-based topological indices such as the sum connectivity temperature index, product connectivity temperature index, F-temperature index, and symmetric division temperature index to predict the thermodynamic properties, such as enthalpies of formation ($\Delta H^{0}_{f}$ \hspace{1mm} liquid), enthalpies of combustion ($\Delta H^{0}_{C}$ \hspace{1mm} liquid), and enthalpies of vaporization ($\Delta H^{0}_{vap}$ \hspace{1mm} gas) of monocarboxylic acids ($C_2H_{4}O_{2}$ - $C_{20}H_{40}O_{2}$).

Training Transformer Models by Wavelet Losses Improves Quantitative and   Visual Performance in Single Image Super-Resolution,"Cansu Korkmaz, A.

However, early Transformer-based approaches that rely on self-attention within non-overlapping windows encounter challenges in acquiring global information. To activate more input pixels globally, hybrid attention models have been proposed. Moreover, training by solely minimizing pixel-wise RGB losses, such as L1, have been found inadequate for capturing essential high-frequency details. This paper presents two contributions: i) We introduce convolutional non-local sparse attention (NLSA) blocks to extend the hybrid transformer architecture in order to further enhance its receptive field. ii) We employ wavelet losses to train Transformer models to improve quantitative and subjective performance. While wavelet losses have been explored previously, showing their power in training Transformer-based SR models is novel.

Predicting effective quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable   media,Christopher D. Marcotte,"We develop a linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching -- the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence -- for localized pulse solutions in models of excitable media. The theory accounts for an additional equivariance compared to the homogeneous ignition problem, and thus requires a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess their accuracy for several models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of continuing a scalar root, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.",2024-04-23T09:16:55Z,2024-11-26T10:05:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14854v3,"nlin.PS, cs.NA, math.NA, q-bio.QM, 35-04"

To bridge this gap, we developed a novel mathematical model that formalizes the link between exercise and short- and long-term glucose-insulin dynamics to predict the benefits of regular exercise on T2D progression. The model quantitatively captured the dose-response relationship (larger benefits with increasing intensity and/or duration of exercise), it consistently reproduced the benefits of clinical guidelines for diabetes prevention, and it accurately predicted persistent benefits following interruption of physical activity, in line with real-world evidence from the literature. These results are encouraging and can be the basis for future development of decision support tools able to assist patients and clinicians in tailoring preventive lifestyle interventions.",2024-04-23T10:58:02Z,2024-04-23T10:58:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14915v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14915v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY, q-bio.QM"
Autonomous LLM-driven research from data to human-verifiable research   papers,"Tal Ifargan, Lukas Hafner, Maor Kern, Ori Alcalay, Roy Kishony","As AI promises to accelerate scientific discovery, it remains unclear whether fully AI-driven research is possible and whether it can adhere to key scientific values, such as transparency, traceability and verifiability. Mimicking human scientific practices, we built data-to-paper, an automation platform that guides interacting LLM agents through a complete stepwise research process, while programmatically back-tracing information flow and allowing human oversight and interactions. In autopilot mode, provided with annotated data alone, data-to-paper raised hypotheses, designed research plans, wrote and debugged analysis codes, generated and interpreted results, and created complete and information-traceable research papers. Even though research novelty was relatively limited, the process demonstrated autonomous generation of de novo quantitative insights from data. For simple research goals, a fully-autonomous cycle can create manuscripts which recapitulate peer-reviewed publications without major errors in about 80-90%, yet as goal complexity increases, human co-piloting becomes critical for assuring accuracy. Beyond the process itself, created manuscripts too are inherently verifiable, as information-tracing allows to programmatically chain results, methods and data. Our work thereby demonstrates a potential for AI-driven acceleration of scientific discovery while enhancing, rather than jeopardizing, traceability, transparency and verifiability.",2024-04-24T23:15:49Z,2024-04-24T23:15:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17605v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17605v1,"q-bio.OT, cs.AI"
Quantitative Tools for Time Series Analysis in Natural Language   Processing: A Practitioners Guide,W. Benedikt Schmal,"Natural language processing tools have become frequently used in social sciences such as economics, political science, and sociology. Many publications apply topic modeling to elicit latent topics in text corpora and their development over time. Here, most publications rely on visual inspections and draw inference on changes, structural breaks, and developments over time. We suggest using univariate time series econometrics to introduce more quantitative rigor that can strengthen the analyses. In particular, we discuss the econometric topics of non-stationarity as well as structural breaks. This paper serves as a comprehensive practitioners guide to provide researchers in the social and life sciences as well as the humanities with concise advice on how to implement econometric time series methods to thoroughly investigate topic prevalences over time. We provide coding advice for the statistical software R throughout the paper. The application of the discussed tools to a sample dataset completes the analysis.",2024-04-29T08:41:17Z,2024-04-29T08:41:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18499v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18499v1,"econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
Continuous max-flow augmentation of self-supervised few-shot learning on   SPECT left ventricles,"Ádám István Szűcs, Béla Kári, Oszkár Pártos","Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) left ventricular assessment protocols are important for detecting ischemia in high-risk patients. To quantitatively measure myocardial function, clinicians depend on commercially available solutions to segment and reorient the left ventricle (LV) for evaluation. Based on large normal datasets, the segmentation performance and the high price of these solutions can hinder the availability of reliable and precise localization of the LV delineation. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings this paper aims to give a recipe for diagnostic centers as well as for clinics to automatically segment the myocardium based on small and low-quality labels on reconstructed SPECT, complete field-of-view (FOV) volumes. A combination of Continuous Max-Flow (CMF) with prior shape information is developed to augment the 3D U-Net self-supervised learning (SSL) approach on various geometries of SPECT apparatus. Experimental results on the acquired dataset have shown a 5-10\% increase in quantitative metrics based on the previous State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions, suggesting a good plausible way to tackle the few-shot SSL problem on high-noise SPECT cardiac datasets.",2024-05-09T03:19:19Z,2024-05-09T03:19:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05520v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05520v1,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG"
A Mathematical Reconstruction of Endothelial Cell Networks,"Okezue Bell, Anthony Bell","Endothelial cells form the linchpin of vascular and lymphatic systems, creating intricate networks that are pivotal for angiogenesis, controlling vessel permeability, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Despite their critical roles, there is no rigorous mathematical framework to represent the connectivity structure of endothelial networks. Here, we develop a pioneering mathematical formalism called $\pi$-graphs to model the multi-type junction connectivity of endothelial networks. We define $\pi$-graphs as abstract objects consisting of endothelial cells and their junction sets, and introduce the key notion of $\pi$-isomorphism that captures when two $\pi$-graphs have the same connectivity structure. We prove several propositions relating the $\pi$-graph representation to traditional graph-theoretic representations, showing that $\pi$-isomorphism implies isomorphism of the corresponding unnested endothelial graphs, but not vice versa. We also introduce a temporal dimension to the $\pi$-graph formalism and explore the evolution of topological invariants in spatial embeddings of $\pi$-graphs. Finally, we outline a topological framework to represent the spatial embedding of $\pi$-graphs into geometric spaces. The $\pi$-graph formalism provides a novel tool for quantitative analysis of endothelial network connectivity and its relation to function, with the potential to yield new insights into vascular physiology and pathophysiology.",2024-05-16T01:14:13Z,2024-05-16T01:14:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09748v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09748v1,"q-bio.CB, math.CO, math.GR, q-bio.QM"
MAGE: Model-Level Graph Neural Networks Explanations via Motif-based   Graph Generation,"Zhaoning Yu, Hongyang Gao","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.",2024-05-21T06:12:24Z,2024-05-21T06:12:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12519v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12519v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, q-bio.QM"
Analog or Digital In-memory Computing? Benchmarking through Quantitative   Modeling,"Jiacong Sun, Pouya Houshmand, Marian Verhelst","In-Memory Computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for energy-efficient, throughput-efficient and area-efficient machine learning at the edge. However, the differences in hardware architectures, array dimensions, and fabrication technologies among published IMC realizations have made it difficult to grasp their relative strengths. Moreover, previous studies have primarily focused on exploring and benchmarking the peak performance of a single IMC macro rather than full system performance on real workloads. This paper aims to address the lack of a quantitative comparison of Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC) and Digital In-Memory Computing (DIMC) processor architectures. We propose an analytical IMC performance model that is validated against published implementations and integrated into a system-level exploration framework for comprehensive performance assessments on different workloads with varying IMC configurations. Our experiments show that while DIMC generally has higher computational density than AIMC, AIMC with large macro sizes may have better energy efficiency than DIMC on convolutional-layers and pointwise-layers, which can exploit high spatial unrolling. On the other hand, DIMC with small macro size outperforms AIMC on depthwise-layers, which feature limited spatial unrolling opportunities inside a macro.",2024-05-23T18:27:19Z,2024-05-23T18:27:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14978v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14978v1,"eess.SP, cs.AR, eess.IV"

Methods: Deep learning is integrated with autofocus to improve motion artifact suppression, which is applied QSM of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The estimation of affine motion parameters in the autofocus method depends on signal-to-noise ratio and lacks accuracy when data sampling occurs outside the k-space center. A deep learning strategy is employed to remove the residual motion artifacts in autofocus. Results: Results obtained in simulated brain data (n =15) with reference truth show that the proposed autofocus deep learning method significantly improves the image quality of mGRE and QSM (p = 0.001 for SSIM, p < 0.0001 for PSNR and RMSE). Results from 10 PD patients with real motion artifacts in QSM have also been corrected using the proposed method and sent to an experienced radiologist for image quality evaluation, and the average image quality score has increased (p=0.0039).

Graph entropies have evolved as information-theoretic tools to investigate the structural information of a molecular graph. In this study, we compute the Nirmala index, the first and second inverse Nirmala index of the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine, with the help of its M-polynomial. Furthermore, entropy measures for the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine are computed using Shannon's entropy model. The comparison between the Nirmala indices and their associated entropy measures is presented through numerical computation.

Second, we investigate PIA with unbounded coefficients but no control over the diffusion term. In this scenario, we first provide the well-posedness of the exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with linear growth coefficients and polynomial growth reward function.

In this paper, we propose simplified, efficient methods of root cause analysis when the task is to identify a unique root cause instead of quantitative contribution analysis. Our proposed methods run in linear order of SCM nodes and they require only the causal DAG without counterfactuals. Furthermore, for those use cases where the causal DAG is unknown, we justify the heuristic of identifying root causes as the variables with the highest anomaly score. To this end, we prove that anomalies with small scores are unlikely to cause those with large scores and show upper bounds for the likelihood of causal pathways with non-monotonic anomaly scores.",2024-06-07T15:24:38Z,2024-11-06T14:09:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05014v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05014v2,"stat.ML, cs.LG"
"Trade, Growth, and Product Innovation",Carlos Góes,"Can trade integration induce product innovation? I document that countries that joined the European Union (EU) started producing more product varieties, investing more in R&D, and trading more compared to candidate countries that did not join at a given horizon. Additionally, I show that a plausibly exogenous increase in market access increases the probability of a given country starting production of and exporting a given product. To rationalize this reduced-form evidence, I propose a new quantitative framework that integrates the forces of specialization and market size. This is a dynamic general equilibrium model of frictional trade and endogenous growth with arbitrarily many asymmetric countries that nests the Eaton-Kortum model of trade and the Romer growth model as special cases. The key result is an analytical expression to decompose gains from trade into dynamic and static components. In this framework, the product innovation growth rate increases with higher market access. Finally, a quantitative version of the model suggests that: (a) the EU enlargement increased its long-run yearly growth rate by about 0.10pp; and (b) dynamic gains can account for between 65-90% of total welfare gains from trade.",2024-06-13T01:09:30Z,2024-06-13T01:09:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08727v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08727v1,"econ.GN, q-fin.EC"

Here, we develop a nonequilibrium framework that combines fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements of intracellular diffusion with nonequilibrium theory to quantitatively analyze cell-specific nonthermal driving forces and cellular adaptability. Our results reveal that intracellular particle diffusion is influenced not only by common thermal forces but also by nonthermal forces generated by approximately 10-100 motor proteins. Furthermore, we derive a physical parameter that quantitatively assesses the sensitivity of intracellular particle responses to these nonthermal forces, showing that systems with more active diffusion exhibit higher response sensitivity. Our work highlights the biological fluctuations arising from multiple interacting elements, advancing the understanding of the complex mechanical properties within living cells.",2024-08-13T07:21:18Z,2024-08-13T07:21:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06683v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06683v1,"physics.bio-ph, q-bio.CB"

Extending the Quantitative Pattern-Matching Paradigm,"Sandra Alves, Delia Kesner, Miguel Ramos","We show how (well-established) type systems based on non-idempotent intersection types can be extended to characterize termination properties of functional programming languages with pattern matching features. To model such programming languages, we use a (weak and closed) $\lambda$-calculus integrating a pattern matching mechanism on algebraic data types (ADTs). Remarkably, we also show that this language not only encodes Plotkin's CBV and CBN $\lambda$-calculus as well as other subsuming frameworks, such as the bang-calculus, but can also be used to interpret the semantics of effectful languages with exceptions. After a thorough study of the untyped language, we introduce a type system based on intersection types, and we show through purely logical methods that the set of terminating terms of the language corresponds exactly to that of well-typed terms. Moreover, by considering non-idempotent intersection types, this characterization turns out to be quantitative, i.e. the size of the type derivation of a term t gives an upper bound for the number of evaluation steps from t to its normal form.",2024-08-20T17:01:56Z,2024-08-20T17:01:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11007v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11007v1,"cs.PL, cs.LO, D.3.1; F.4.1"

Here, we present a low-cost experiment that allows for direct visual observation of the Zeeman effect. Our setup involves a flame containing sodium (from table salt) placed in front of a sodium vapor lamp. When a magnetic field is applied to the flame, the shadow cast by the flame noticeably lightens, providing a clear, naked-eye demonstration of the Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we conduct two quantitative experiments using this setup, examining the effects of varying magnetic field strength and sodium concentration.

Employing computational models, we extracted and processed gaze-related features from the videos of both participants and examiners. The experimental samples were divided into three groups based on the presence of social gaze abnormalities and ASD diagnosis. This study quantitatively analyzed four gaze features: gaze engagement, gaze variance, gaze density map, and gaze diversion frequency.

Quantitative Quantum Zeno and Strong Damping Limits in Strong Topology,Robert Salzmann,"Frequent applications of a mixing quantum operation to a quantum system slow down its time evolution and eventually drive it into the invariant subspace of the named operation. We prove this phenomenon, the quantum Zeno effect, and its continuous variant, strong damping, in a unified way for infinite-dimensional open quantum systems, while merely demanding that the respective mixing convergence holds pointwise for all states. Both results are quantitative in the following sense: Given the speed of convergence for the mixing limits, we can derive bounds on the convergence speed for the corresponding quantum Zeno and strong damping limits. We apply our results to prove quantum Zeno and strong damping limits for the photon loss channel with an explicit bound on the convergence speed.",2024-09-10T12:53:19Z,2024-09-10T12:53:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06469v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06469v1,"quant-ph, math-ph, math.FA, math.MP"
Asymptotics for Random Quadratic Transportation Costs,"Martin Huesmann, Michael Goldman, Dario Trevisan","We establish the validity of asymptotic limits for the general transportation problem between random i.i.d. points and their common distribution, with respect to the squared Euclidean distance cost, in any dimension larger than three. Previous results were essentially limited to the two (or one) dimensional case, or to distributions whose absolutely continuous part is uniform.   The proof relies upon recent advances in the stability theory of optimal transportation, combined with functional analytic techniques and some ideas from quantitative stochastic homogenization. The key tool we develop is a quantitative upper bound for the usual quadratic optimal transportation problem in terms of its boundary variant, where points can be freely transported along the boundary. The methods we use are applicable to more general random measures, including occupation measure of Brownian paths, and may open the door to further progress on challenging problems at the interface of analysis, probability, and discrete mathematics.",2024-09-13T07:58:40Z,2025-02-17T16:39:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08612v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08612v2,"math.PR, math.FA, math.ST, stat.TH, 49Q22, 60L99, 60D05, 90C05, 35B27"

However, existing models have often overlooked a crucial physical constraint: atoms must maintain a minimum pairwise distance to avoid separation violation, a phenomenon governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such separation violations, we propose NucleusDiff. It models the interactions between atomic nuclei and their surrounding electron clouds by enforcing the distance constraint between the nuclei and manifolds. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces violation rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design.

We prove that the above statement can be generalized to \emph{approximate} spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition.

BNNs have been shown to significantly reduce computational time in speckle statistics-based QUS without compromising accuracy and precision. Additionally, they provide estimates of feature uncertainty, which can guide the clinician's trust in the reported feature value. The total predictive uncertainty in Bayesian modeling can be decomposed into epistemic (uncertainty over the model parameters) and aleatoric (uncertainty inherent in the data) components. By decomposing the predictive uncertainty, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to the total uncertainty. In this study, we propose a method to compute epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for HK-distribution parameters ($\alpha$ and $k$) estimated by a BNN, in both simulation and experimental data. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the prediction error and both uncertainties, shedding light on the interplay between these uncertainties and HK parameters errors.",2024-09-17T22:16:49Z,2024-09-17T22:16:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11583v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11583v1,"eess.SP, cs.AI, eess.IV, physics.med-ph, stat.ML"
A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts   Among Cybersecurity Professionals,"Sunil Arora, John D.

Analysis of responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44% report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional 28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84% facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile breaches.

Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field   crystal study,"K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T.

The study is conducted through a recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four $5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.",2024-09-18T15:48:01Z,2024-09-18T15:48:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12073v1,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.comp-ph"
bioSBM: a random graph model to integrate epigenomic data in chromatin   structure prediction,"Alex Chen Yi Zhang, Angelo Rosa, Guido Sanguinetti","The spatial organization of chromatin within the nucleus plays a crucial role in gene expression and genome function. However, the quantitative relationship between this organization and nuclear biochemical processes remains under debate. In this study, we present a graph-based generative model, bioSBM, designed to capture long-range chromatin interaction patterns from Hi-C data and, importantly, simultaneously, link these patterns to biochemical features. Applying bioSBM to Hi-C maps of the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line, we identified a latent structure of chromatin interactions, revealing 12 distinct communities that strongly align with known biological annotations. Additionally, we infer a linear transformation that maps biochemical observables, such as histone marks, to the parameters of the generative graph model, enabling accurate genome-wide predictions of chromatin contact maps on out-of-sample data, both within the same cell line, and on the completely unseen HCT116 cell line under RAD21 depletion.

Blockage of thermocapillary flows by surface-active impurities,Thomas Bickel,"Thermocapillary convection is particularly effective for the control of thin liquid film topography or for the actuation of microparticles at the liquid-air interface. Experiments with water are challenging, however, as its interface is prone to contamination by surface-active impurities that profoundly alter its hydrodynamic response. Despite numerous reports highlighting the hindrance of thermocapillary flows, quantitative information on interface contamination is definitely lacking. We therefore introduce a general framework in order to account for the presence of a low concentration of insoluble surfactants at the water-air interface. Focusing on the low-compressibility limit, we identify the inverse Marangoni number as the appropriate small parameter in the modeling. The transport equations can then be linearized without any further assumption regarding the other dimensionless groups. It is shown in particular that the surfactant concentration adapts to the thermocapillary forcing in order to cancel the interfacial viscous stress. Several experimentally relevant situations are discussed with emphasis on physical observables. Besides the excellent agreement between theory and experiment, our predictions provide a quantitative assessment of the impurity concentration.",2024-09-22T15:43:33Z,2024-09-22T15:43:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14493v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14493v1,"cond-mat.soft, physics.flu-dyn"

A quantitative model for the Frank-Read dislocation source based on   pinned mean curvature flow,"Thomas Hudson, Filip Rindler, Joshua Rydell","This work introduces a quantitative model for the Frank-Read source, considered to be one of the most important micro-mechanical mechanisms of dislocation creation in crystalline materials. It has long been known that these sources create dislocations in a repetitive, oscillatory process, which is driven by an external shear force. Unlike the existing explanations in the literature, the model introduced in the present article is based on just a few simple physical principles, namely line tension and dislocation motion due to a single slip plane flow rule, together with a pinning constraint on the ends of the central dislocation line. A complete discretisation, including suitable re-meshing and 'topological cutting' algorithms, is described and simulation results are discussed. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the model and discretisation described in the present work yield remarkably accurate predictions about the shape and properties of the Frank-Read source. In particular, it is shown that only one dimensionless parameter controls the dynamics of the Frank-Read source if one neglects crystal anisotropy.

Our results show that neural operators can efficiently approximate these solution operators without the exponential growth in model complexity, thus strengthening the theoretical foundation of neural operators. A key insight in our proof is to transfer PDEs into the corresponding integral equations via Duahamel's principle, and to leverage the similarity between neural operators and Picard's iteration, a classical algorithm for solving PDEs.

Quantitative measure of topological protection in Floquet systems   through the spectral localizer,"Stephan Wong, Alexander Cerjan, Justin T. Cole","The standard understanding of topological protection from band theory is that a system's topology cannot change without first closing the bulk band gap. However, in Floquet systems, this typical definition of topological protection is one step removed from the experimentally accessible system parameters, as the relationship between the disorder in a system's instantaneous Hamiltonian and its Floquet Hamiltonian that defines its topology is not straightforward. Here, we demonstrate that the spectral localizer framework for classifying material topology can be applied to Floquet systems and prove that its associated measure of topological protection can be understood in terms of the integrated disorder across the system's instantaneous Hamiltonians. As such, we have derived a quantitative bound on a Floquet system's topological protection in terms of the instantaneous system. Moreover, we show the utility of these bounds in both ordinary an anomalous Floquet Chern insulators.",2024-10-31T17:43:03Z,2024-10-31T17:43:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24176v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24176v1,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, math-ph, math.MP"
TradExpert: Revolutionizing Trading with Mixture of Expert LLMs,"Qianggang Ding, Haochen Shi, Bang Liu","The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial domain has opened new avenues for quantitative trading, particularly through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the challenge of effectively synthesizing insights from diverse data sources and integrating both structured and unstructured data persists. This paper presents TradeExpert, a novel framework that employs a mix of experts (MoE) approach, using four specialized LLMs, each analyzing distinct sources of financial data, including news articles, market data, alpha factors, and fundamental data. The insights of these expert LLMs are further synthesized by a General Expert LLM to make a final prediction or decision. With specific prompts, TradeExpert can be switched between the prediction mode and the ranking mode for stock movement prediction and quantitative stock trading, respectively. In addition to existing benchmarks, we also release a large-scale financial dataset to comprehensively evaluate TradeExpert's effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate TradeExpert's superior performance across all trading scenarios.",2024-10-16T20:24:16Z,2024-10-16T20:24:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00782v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00782v1,"cs.AI, q-fin.ST"
A Personal data Value at Risk Approach,Luis Enriquez,"What if the main data protection vulnerability is risk management? Data Protection merges three disciplines: data protection law, information security, and risk management. Nonetheless, very little research has been made on the field of data protection risk management, where subjectivity and superficiality are the dominant state of the art. Since the GDPR tells you what to do, but not how to do it, the solution for approaching GDPR compliance is still a gray zone, where the trend is using the rule of thumb. Considering that the most important goal of risk management is to reduce uncertainty in order to take informed decisions, risk management for the protection of the rights and freedoms of the data subjects cannot be disconnected from the impact materialization that data controllers and processors need to assess. This paper proposes a quantitative approach to data protection risk-based compliance from a data controllers perspective, with the aim of proposing a mindset change, where data protection impact assessments can be improved by using data protection analytics, quantitative risk analysis, and calibrating expert opinions.",2024-11-05T16:09:28Z,2024-11-06T21:53:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03217v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03217v2,"q-fin.RM, cs.LG"
Graph Neural Networks for Quantifying Compatibility Mechanisms in   Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Jingqi Zeng, Xiaobin Jia","Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) involves complex compatibility mechanisms characterized by multi-component and multi-target interactions, which are challenging to quantify. To address this challenge, we applied graph artificial intelligence to develop a TCM multi-dimensional knowledge graph that bridges traditional TCM theory and modern biomedical science (https://zenodo.org/records/13763953 ). Using feature engineering and embedding, we processed key TCM terminology and Chinese herbal pieces (CHP), introducing medicinal properties as virtual nodes and employing graph neural networks with attention mechanisms to model and analyze 6,080 Chinese herbal formulas (CHF). Our method quantitatively assessed the roles of CHP within CHF and was validated using 215 CHF designed for COVID-19 management.

Quantitative Estimates on Invariant Manifolds for Surface   Diffeomorphisms,"Sylvain Crovisier, Mikhail Lyubich, Enrique Pujals, Jonguk Yang","We carry out a detailed quantitative analysis on the geometry of invariant manifolds for smooth dissipative systems in dimension two. We begin by quantifying the regularity of any orbit (finite or infinite) in the phase space with a set of explicit inequalities. Then we relate this directly to the quasi-linearization of the local dynamics on regular neighborhoods of this orbit. The parameters of regularity explicitly determine the sizes of the regular neighborhoods and the smooth norms of the corresponding regular charts. As a corollary, we establish the existence of smooth stable and center manifolds with uniformly bounded geometries for regular orbits independently of any pre-existing invariant measure.

Elucidating chirality transfer in liquid crystals of viruses,"Eric Grelet, Maxime Tortora","Chirality is ubiquitous in nature across all length scales, with major implications spanning the fields of biology, chemistry and physics to materials science. How chirality propagates from nanoscale building blocks to meso- and macroscopic helical structures remains an open issue. Here, working with a canonical system of filamentous viruses, we demonstrate that their self-assembly into chiral liquid crystal phases quantitatively results from the interplay between two main mechanisms of chirality transfer: electrostatic interactions from the helical charge patterns on the virus surface, and fluctuation-based helical deformations leading to viral backbone helicity. Our experimental and theoretical approach provides a comprehensive framework for deciphering how chirality is hierarchically and quantitatively propagated across spatial scales. Our work highlights the ways in which supramolecular helicity may arise from subtle chiral contributions of opposite handedness which either act cooperatively or competitively, thus accounting for the multiplicity of chiral behaviors observed for nearly identical molecular systems.",2024-11-20T16:35:56Z,2024-11-20T16:35:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13445v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13445v1,"cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph"
The ultimate issue error in scientific inference: mistaking parameters   for hypotheses,Stanley E. Lazic,"Statistical inference often conflates the probability of a parameter with the probability of a hypothesis, a critical misunderstanding termed the ultimate issue error. This error is pervasive across the social, biological, and medical sciences, where null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is mistakenly understood to be testing hypotheses rather than evaluating parameter estimates. Here, we advocate for using the Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach, which integrates quantitative data with qualitative background information for more accurate and transparent inference. Through a detailed example involving the relationship between vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D) levels and COVID-19 risk, we demonstrate how WoE quantifies support for hypotheses while accounting for study design biases, power, and confounding factors. These findings emphasise the necessity of combining statistical metrics with contextual evaluation.

The systems considered include the Einstein vacuum equations commuted with suitable time-dependent vector fields, where we treat the nonlinear terms as general inhomogeneous factors.

"Towards the Structure and Mechanisms of Complex Systems, the Approach of   the Quantitative Theory of Meaning","Inga Ivanova, John S. Torday","We study analysis of complex systems using a Quantitative Theory of Meaning developed as an extention of Shannon's Communication Theory. The approach consideres complexity not in terms of the manifestation of its effects which are manifestation of the dynamics of the system, but in terms of primary causes and taking into account the topology of the system. Here, the dynamics of the system are provided by reflexive communication between heterogenious agents that make up the system. Unlike Shannon's Communication Theory the Theory of Meaning imposes restrictions on the complex systems being analyzed. Non-linearity and specific dynamics of the system arise as a consequence of the topology of the system. This topology also suggests a method for analyzing complex systems, the logistic Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).

Hierarchical Control of Emotion Rendering in Speech Synthesis,"Sho Inoue, Kun Zhou, Shuai Wang, Haizhou Li","Emotional text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) aims to generate realistic emotional speech from input text. However, quantitatively controlling multi-level emotion rendering remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based emotional TTS framework with a novel approach for emotion intensity modeling to facilitate fine-grained control over emotion rendering at the phoneme, word, and utterance levels. We introduce a hierarchical emotion distribution (ED) extractor that captures a quantifiable ED embedding across different speech segment levels. Additionally, we explore various acoustic features and assess their impact on emotion intensity modeling. During TTS training, the hierarchical ED embedding effectively captures the variance in emotion intensity from the reference audio and correlates it with linguistic and speaker information. The TTS model not only generates emotional speech during inference, but also quantitatively controls the emotion rendering over the speech constituents. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in terms of speech quality, emotional expressiveness, and hierarchical emotion control.",2024-12-17T03:02:05Z,2025-01-10T13:21:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12498v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12498v2,"cs.SD, eess.AS"

Different from previous works, we do not neglect the relativistic effect on the presence of the pressure in momentum equation. For the RCS model, we provide a quantitative estimate on the uniform-time classical limit with an optimal convergence rate which is the same as in finite-time classical limit under a relaxed initial condition. We also allow corresponding initial data for the RCS and Cucker-Smale (CS) model to be different in the classical limit. This removes earlier constraints employed in the previous classical limit. As a direct application of this optimal convergence rate in the classical limit of the RCS model, we derive an optimal convergence rate for the corresponding uniform-time classical limit for the kinetic RCS model.",2024-12-17T15:34:53Z,2024-12-17T15:34:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13015v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13015v1,"math.AP, math-ph, math.MP, 70F99, 92B25"

The driven source is assumed to be a generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random function whose covariance operator is a classical pseudodifferential operator. We examine the meromorphic continuation and estimates for the resolvent of the biharmonic Schrodinger operator with respect to complex frequencies, which yields the well-posedness of the direct problem and a Born series expansion for the solution. For the inverse problem, we present quantitative stability estimates in determining the micro-correlation strength of the random source by using the correlation far-field data at multiple frequencies.

Is the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Broken?

In our study we try to estimate the effect of securitization on the interest elasticity and to identify if a liquidity trap occurred during 1954Q3-2019Q3. The yield curve inversion mechanism shows us that economic cycles are very sensitive to decreasing profitability of banks. However there is no evidence that restoring their profits will ensure a strong recovery. In this regard, we research the low effect of Quantitative Easing (QE) upon economic growth and analyze whether securitization and liquidity traps posed challenges to QE or is it the mainstream theory flawed. In this regard we will examine the main weaknesses of QE, respectively the speculative behavior induced by artificial low rates and its unequal distribution.

This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings.

"Optimizing MACD Trading Strategies A Dance of Finance, Wavelets, and   Genetics","Wangyu Chen, Zhenpeng Zhu","In today's financial markets, quantitative trading has become an essential trading method, with the MACD indicator widely employed in quantitative trading strategies. This paper begins by screening and cleaning the dataset, establishing a model that adheres to the basic buy and sell rules of the MACD, and calculating key metrics such as the win rate, return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown for each stock. However, the MACD often generates erroneous signals in highly volatile markets. To address this, wavelet transform is applied to reduce noise, smoothing the DIF image, and a model is developed based on this to optimize the identification of buy and sell points. The results show that the annualized return has increased by 5%, verifying the feasibility of the method.   Subsequently, the divergence principle is used to further optimize the trading strategy, enhancing the model's performance. Additionally, a genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the MACD parameters, tailoring the strategy to the characteristics of different stocks. To improve computational efficiency, the MindSpore framework is used for resource management and parallel computing. The optimized strategy demonstrates improved win rates, returns, Sharpe ratios, and a reduction in maximum drawdown in backtesting.",2025-01-18T16:10:58Z,2025-02-04T13:14:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10808v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10808v2,"cs.CE, G.3; I.2.8; F.2.1"

In this regime, a classical IMEX-RK approach involves an implicit coupling between the momentum and energy balance so as to avoid the acoustic CFL restriction, while the density can be treated in a fully explicit fashion. This approach leads to a mildly nonlinear equation for the pressure, which can be solved according to a fixed point procedure. An alternative strategy consists of employing a semi-implicit temporal integrator based on IMEX-RK methods (SI-IMEX-RK). The stiff dependence is carefully analyzed, so as to avoid the solution of a nonlinear equation for the pressure also for equations of state (EOS) of non-ideal gases. The spatial discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which naturally allows high-order accuracy.

Production of patents and publications doubles every ten years, by contrast with the growth of computing resources driven by Moore's Law, roughly a doubling every two years. We argue that the input of AI researchers is also crucial and its contribution can be objectively estimated. Consequently, we give a simple argument that explains the 5:1 relation between these two rates.

Weighted variational inequalities for heat semigroups associated with   Schrödinger operators related to critical radius functions,"Yongming Wen, Huoxiong Wu","Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a Schr\""{o}dinger operator and $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ be the variation operator of heat semigroup associated to $\mathcal{L}$ with $\varrho>2$. In this paper, we first obtain the quantitative weighted $L^p$ bounds for $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ with a class of weights related to critical radius functions, which contains the classical Muckenhoupt weights as a proper subset. Next, a new bump condition, which is weaker than the classical bump condition, is given for two-weight inequality of $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$, and the weighted mixed weak type inequality corresponding to Sawyer's conjecture for $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ are obtained. Furthermore, the quantitative restricted weak type $(p,p)$ bounds for $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ are also given with a new class of weights $A_{p}^{\rho,\theta,\mathcal{R}}$, which is larger than the classical $A_{p}^{\mathcal{R}}$ weights.

Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity   suppression in metallic thin films,"Alessio Zaccone, Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto","Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers ""materials by design"" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.",2025-02-12T14:54:22Z,2025-02-20T17:27:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08459v2,"cond-mat.supr-con, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.app-ph"
Accelerating Quantitative MRI using Subspace Multiscale Energy Model   (SS-MuSE),"Yan Chen, Jyothi Rikhab Chand, Steven R. Kecskemeti, James H. Holmes, Mathews Jacob","Multi-contrast MRI methods acquire multiple images with different contrast weightings, which are used for the differentiation of the tissue types or quantitative mapping. However, the scan time needed to acquire multiple contrasts is prohibitively long for 3D acquisition schemes, which can offer isotropic image resolution. While deep learning-based methods have been extensively used to accelerate 2D and 2D + time problems, the high memory demand, computation time, and need for large training data sets make them challenging for large-scale volumes. To address these challenges, we generalize the plug-and-play multi-scale energy-based model (MuSE) to a regularized subspace recovery setting, where we jointly regularize the 3D multi-contrast spatial factors in a subspace formulation.

Identifying Features that Shape Perceived Consciousness in Large   Language Model-based AI: A Quantitative Study of Human Responses,"Bongsu Kang, Jundong Kim, Tae-Rim Yun, Hyojin Bae, Chang-Eop Kim","This study quantitively examines which features of AI-generated text lead humans to perceive subjective consciousness in large language model (LLM)-based AI systems. Drawing on 99 passages from conversations with Claude 3 Opus and focusing on eight features -- metacognitive self-reflection, logical reasoning, empathy, emotionality, knowledge, fluency, unexpectedness, and subjective expressiveness -- we conducted a survey with 123 participants. Using regression and clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence participants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that metacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions significantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on knowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing distinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of LLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater overall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness.

The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures.

The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis.

Resolving quantitative MRI model degeneracy in self-supervised machine   learning,"Giulio V. Minore, Louis Dwyer-Hemmings, Timothy J. P. Bray, Hui Zhang","Quantitative MRI (qMRI) estimates tissue properties of interest from measured MRI signals. This process is conventionally achieved by computationally expensive model fitting, which limits qMRI's clinical use, motivating recent development based on machine learning. Self-supervised approaches are particularly popular as they avoid the pitfall of distributional shift that affects supervised methods. However, it is unknown how they would behave if similar signals can result from multiple tissue properties, a common challenge known as model degeneracy. Understanding this is crucial for ascertaining the scope within which self-supervised approaches may be applied. To this end, this work makes two contributions. First, we demonstrate that model degeneracy will compromise self-supervised approaches, motivating the development of mitigating strategies. Second, we propose such a mitigating solution based on applying appropriate constraining transforms on the output of the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder network typically employed in self-supervised approaches. We illustrate both contributions using the estimation of proton density fat fraction and $R_2^*$ from chemical shift-encoded MRI, an ideal exemplar due to its exhibition of degeneracy across the full parameter space.

Quantifying the rise and fall of scientific fields,"Chakresh Singh, Emma Barme, Robert Ward, Liubov Tupikina, Marc Santolini","Science advances by pushing the boundaries of the adjacent possible. While the global scientific enterprise grows at an exponential pace, at the mesoscopic level the exploration and exploitation of research ideas is reflected through the rise and fall of research fields. The empirical literature has largely studied such dynamics on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on explaining how and why communities of knowledge production evolve. Although fields rise and fall on different temporal and population scales, they are generally argued to pass through a common set of evolutionary stages. To understand the social processes that drive these stages beyond case studies, we need a way to quantify and compare different fields on the same terms. In this paper we develop techniques for identifying scale-invariant patterns in the evolution of scientific fields, and demonstrate their usefulness using 1.5 million preprints from the arXiv repository covering 175 research fields spanning Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology and Quantitative Finance. We show that fields consistently follows a rise and fall pattern captured by a two parameters right-tailed Gumbel temporal distribution. We introduce a field-specific rescaled time and explore the generic properties shared by articles and authors at the creation, adoption, peak, and decay evolutionary phases. We find that the early phase of a field is characterized by the mixing of cognitively distant fields by small teams of interdisciplinary authors, while late phases exhibit the role of specialized, large teams building on the previous works in the field. This method provides foundations to quantitatively explore the generic patterns underlying the evolution of research fields in science, with general implications in innovation studies.",2021-07-08T10:49:21Z,2021-07-09T06:58:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03749v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03749v2,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI"
A framework for quantitative analysis of Computed Tomography images of   viral pneumonitis: radiomic features in COVID and non-COVID patients,"Giulia Zorzi, Luca Berta, Stefano Carrazza, Alberto Torresin","Purpose: to optimize a pipeline of clinical data gathering and CT images processing implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and to develop artificial intelligence model for different of viral pneumonia. Methods: 1028 chest CT image of patients with positive swab were segmented automatically for lung extraction.

Furthermore, radiomic features (RF) of first and second order were extracted from bilateral lungs using PyRadiomic tools. QM and RF were used to develop 4 different Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier to discriminate images of patients with COVID (n=646) and non-COVID (n=382) viral pneumonia. Results: The Gaussian model applied to lung CT histogram correctly described healthy parenchyma 94% of the patients. The resulting accuracy of the models for COVID diagnosis were in the range 0.76-0.87, as the integral of the receiver operating curve. The best diagnostic performances were associated to the model based on RF of first and second order, with 21 relevant features after LASSO regression and an accuracy of 0.81$\pm$0.02 after 4-fold cross validation Conclusions: Despite these results were obtained with CT images from a single center, a platform for extracting useful quantitative metrics from CT images was developed and optimized.

Human Reliability Analysis for Oil and Gas Operations: Analysis of   Existing Methods,"Marilia Ramos, Camille Major, Nsimah Ekanem, Cesar Malpica, Ali Mosleh","In the petroleum industry, Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) has been one of the main tools for risk management. To date, QRA has mostly focused on technical barriers, despite many accidents having human failure as a primary cause or a contributing factor. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) allows for the assessment of the human contribution to risk to be assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Most credible and highly advanced HRA methods have largely been developed and applied in support of nuclear power plants control room operations and in context of probabilistic risk analysis. Moreover, many of the HRA methods have issues that have led to inconsistencies, insufficient traceability and reproducibility in both the qualitative and quantitative phases. Given the need to assess human error in the context of the oil industry, it is necessary to evaluate available HRA methodologies and assess its applicability to petroleum operations. Furthermore, it is fundamental to assess these methods against good practices of HRA and the requirements for advanced HRA methods. The present paper accomplishes this by analyzing seven HRA methods. The evaluation of the methods was performed in three stages. The first stage consisted of an evaluation of the degree of adaptability of the method for the Oil and Gas industry. In the second stage the methods were evaluated against desirable items in an HRA method. The higher-ranked methods were evaluated, in the third stage, against requirements for advanced HRA methods. In addition to the methods' evaluation, this paper presents an overview of state-of-the-art discussions on HRA, led by the Nuclear industry community. It remarks that these discussions must be seriously considered in defining a technical roadmap to a credible HRA method for the Oil and Gas industry.",2021-09-28T23:25:44Z,2021-09-28T23:25:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14096v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14096v1,"eess.SY, cs.SY"

Harrison","Background & Aims: Hepatic steatosis is a major cause of chronic liver disease. 2D ultrasound is the most widely used non-invasive tool for screening and monitoring, but associated diagnoses are highly subjective. We developed a scalable deep learning (DL) algorithm for quantitative scoring of liver steatosis from 2D ultrasound images.   Approach & Results: Using retrospectively collected multi-view ultrasound data from 3,310 patients, 19,513 studies, and 228,075 images, we trained a DL algorithm to diagnose steatosis stages (healthy, mild, moderate, or severe) from ultrasound diagnoses. Performance was validated on two multi-scanner unblinded and blinded (initially to DL developer) histology-proven cohorts (147 and 112 patients) with histopathology fatty cell percentage diagnoses, and a subset with FibroScan diagnoses. We also quantified reliability across scanners and viewpoints. Results were evaluated using Bland-Altman and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The DL algorithm demonstrates repeatable measurements with a moderate number of images (3 for each viewpoint) and high agreement across 3 premium ultrasound scanners. High diagnostic performance was observed across all viewpoints: area under the curves of the ROC to classify >=mild, >=moderate, =severe steatosis grades were 0.85, 0.90, and 0.93, respectively. The DL algorithm outperformed or performed at least comparably to FibroScan with statistically significant improvements for all levels on the unblinded histology-proven cohort, and for =severe steatosis on the blinded histology-proven cohort.

Objective assessment of corneal transparency in the clinical setting   with standard SD-OCT devices,"Maëlle Vilbert, Romain Bocheux, Cristina Georgeon, Vincent Borderie, Pascal Pernot, Kristina Irsch, Karsten Plamann","PURPOSE: To develop an automated algorithm allowing extraction of quantitative corneal transparency parameters from clinical spectral-domain OCT images. To establish a representative dataset of normative transparency values from healthy corneas.   METHODS: SD-OCT images of 83 normal corneas (ages 22-50 years) from a standard clinical device (RTVue-XR Avanti, Optovue Inc.) were processed. A pre-processing procedure is applied first, including a derivative approach and a PCA-based correction mask, to eliminate common central artifacts (i.e., apex-centered column saturation artifact and posterior stromal artifact) and enable standardized analysis. The mean intensity stromal-depth profile is then extracted over a 6-mm-wide corneal area and analyzed according to our previously developed method deriving quantitative transparency parameters related to the physics of light propagation in tissues, notably tissular heterogeneity (Birge ratio; $B_r$), followed by the photon mean-free path ($l_s$) in homogeneous tissues (i.e., $B_r \sim 1$).   RESULTS: After confirming stromal homogeneity ($B_r < 10$, IDR: 1.9-5.1), we measured a median $l_s$ of 570 $\mu$m (IDR: 270-2400 $\mu$m). Considering corneal thicknesses, this may be translated into a median fraction of transmitted (coherent) light $T_{coh(stroma)}$ of 51$\%$ (IDR: 22-83$\%$). No statistically significant correlation between transparency and age or thickness was found.   CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm provides robust and quantitative measurement of corneal transparency from standard clinical SD-OCT images. It yields lower transparency values than previously reported, which may be attributed to our method being exclusively sensitive to spatially coherent light. Excluding images with central artifacts wider than 300 $\mu$m also raises our median $T_{coh(stroma)}$ to 70$\%$ (IDR: 34-87$\%$).",2021-12-01T14:36:08Z,2021-12-01T14:36:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00528v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.00528v1,"physics.med-ph, eess.IV"

Here, we describe a deep learning-based virtual HER2 IHC staining method using a conditional generative adversarial network that is trained to rapidly transform autofluorescence microscopic images of unlabeled/label-free breast tissue sections into bright-field equivalent microscopic images, matching the standard HER2 IHC staining that is chemically performed on the same tissue sections. The efficacy of this virtual HER2 staining framework was demonstrated by quantitative analysis, in which three board-certified breast pathologists blindly graded the HER2 scores of virtually stained and immunohistochemically stained HER2 whole slide images (WSIs) to reveal that the HER2 scores determined by inspecting virtual IHC images are as accurate as their immunohistochemically stained counterparts. A second quantitative blinded study performed by the same diagnosticians further revealed that the virtually stained HER2 images exhibit a comparable staining quality in the level of nuclear detail, membrane clearness, and absence of staining artifacts with respect to their immunohistochemically stained counterparts. This virtual HER2 staining framework bypasses the costly, laborious, and time-consuming IHC staining procedures in laboratory, and can be extended to other types of biomarkers to accelerate the IHC tissue staining used in life sciences and biomedical workflow.",2021-12-08T08:56:15Z,2021-12-08T08:56:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05240v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05240v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.LG, eess.IV, physics.med-ph"

To address this, we posit a quantitative, mechanistic framework of ECT response based on Network Control Theory (NCT). Then, we empirically test our approach and employ it to predict ECT treatment response. To this end, we derive a formal association between Postictal Suppression Index (PSI) - an ECT seizure quality index - and whole-brain modal and average controllability, NCT metrics based on white matter brain network architecture, respectively. Exploiting the known association of ECT response and PSI, we then hypothesized an association between our controllability metrics and ECT response mediated by PSI. We formally tested this conjecture in N=50 depressive patients undergoing ECT. We show that whole-brain controllability metrics based on pre-ECT structural connectome data predict ECT response in accordance with our hypotheses. In addition, we show the expected mediation effects via PSI. Importantly, our theoretically motivated metrics are at least on par with extensive machine learning models based on pre-ECT connectome data. In summary, we derived and tested a control-theoretic framework capable of predicting ECT response based on individual brain network architecture. It makes testable, quantitative predictions regarding individual therapeutic response, which are corroborated by strong empirical evidence.

Clinician rating of symptoms suffers from inter-rater variation, qualitative or semi-quantitative scoring, and limited ability to capture infrequent or fluctuating symptoms. Patient-reported outcomes are limited by recall bias and poor precision. Current tools to measure orofacial and oculomotor function are cumbersome, difficult to implement, and non-portable. Here, we show how Earable, a wearable device, can discriminate certain cranial muscle activities such as chewing, talking, and swallowing. We demonstrate using data from a pilot study of 10 healthy participants how Earable can be used to measure features from EMG, EEG, and EOG waveforms from subjects performing mock Performance Outcome Assessments (mock-PerfOs), utilized widely in clinical research.

"Carleson measure estimates, corona decompositions, and perturbation of   elliptic operators without connectivity","Mingming Cao, Pablo Hidalgo-Palencia, José María Martell","Let $\Omega$ be an open set with Ahlfors-David regular boundary satisfying the corkscrew condition. When $\Omega$ is connected in some quantitative form one can establish that for any real elliptic operator with bounded coefficients, the quantitative absolute continuity of elliptic measures is equivalent to the fact that all bounded null solutions satisfy Carleson measure estimates. In turn, in the same setting these equivalent properties are stable under Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher perturbations. However, without connectivity, there is no Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher perturbation result available. In this paper, we work with a corona decomposition associated with the elliptic measure and show that it is equivalent to the fact that bounded null solutions satisfy partial/weak Carleson measure estimates, or to the fact that the Green function is comparable to the distance to the boundary in the corona sense. This characterization has profound consequences. We extend Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher's perturbation to non-connected settings. For the Laplacian, these corona decompositions or, equivalently, the partial/weak Carleson measure estimates are meaningful enough to characterize the uniform rectifiability of the boundary. As a consequence, we obtain that the boundary of the set is uniformly rectifiable if bounded null solutions for any Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher perturbation of the Laplacian satisfy Carleson measure estimates. For Kenig-Pipher operators any of the properties of the characterization is stable under transposition or symmetrization of the matrices of coefficients. As a result, we obtain that Carleson measure estimates for bounded null-solutions of non-symmetric variable operators satisfying an $L^1$-Kenig-Pipher condition occur if and only if the boundary of the open set is uniformly rectifiable.

This paper presents a quantitative assessment of vascular morphology in healthy and diseased adults including changes during aging and the anatomical variations in the Circle of Willis (CoW). Methods: We used our automatic method to segment and extract novel geometric features of the cerebral vasculature from MRA scans of 175 healthy subjects, 45 AIS, and 50 AD patients after spatial registration. This is followed by quantification and statistical analysis of vascular alterations in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the biggest cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Results: We determined that the CoW is fully formed in only 35 percent of healthy adults and found significantly increased tortuosity and fractality, with increasing age and with disease -- both AIS and AD. We also found significantly decreased vessel length, volume and number of branches in AIS patients. Lastly, we found that AD cerebral vessels exhibited significantly smaller diameter and more complex branching patterns, compared to age-matched healthy adults. These changes were significantly heightened with progression of AD from early onset to moderate-severe dementia. Conclusion: Altered vessel geometry in AIS patients shows that there is pathological morphology coupled with stroke. In AD due to pathological alterations in the endothelium or amyloid depositions leading to neuronal damage and hypoperfusion, vessel geometry is significantly altered even in mild or early dementia.

No-gold-standard evaluation of quantitative imaging methods in the   presence of correlated noise,"Ziping Liu, Zekun Li, Joyce C. Mhlanga, Barry A. Siegel, Abhinav K. Jha","Objective evaluation of quantitative imaging (QI) methods with patient data is highly desirable, but is hindered by the lack or unreliability of an available gold standard. To address this issue, techniques that can evaluate QI methods without access to a gold standard are being actively developed. These techniques assume that the true and measured values are linearly related by a slope, bias, and Gaussian-distributed noise term, where the noise between measurements made by different methods is independent of each other. However, this noise arises in the process of measuring the same quantitative value, and thus can be correlated. To address this limitation, we propose a no-gold-standard evaluation (NGSE) technique that models this correlated noise by a multi-variate Gaussian distribution parameterized by a covariance matrix. We derive a maximum-likelihood-based approach to estimate the parameters that describe the relationship between the true and measured values, without any knowledge of the true values. We then use the estimated slopes and diagonal elements of the covariance matrix to compute the noise-to-slope ratio (NSR) to rank the QI methods on the basis of precision. The proposed NGSE technique was evaluated with multiple numerical experiments. Our results showed that the technique reliably estimated the NSR values and yielded accurate rankings of the considered methods for ~ 83% of 160 trials.

SKM-TEA: A Dataset for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction with Dense Image   Labels for Quantitative Clinical Evaluation,"Arjun D Desai, Andrew M Schmidt, Elka B Rubin, Christopher M Sandino, Marianne S Black, Valentina Mazzoli, Kathryn J Stevens, Robert Boutin, Christopher Ré, Garry E Gold, Brian A Hargreaves, Akshay S Chaudhari","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of modern medical imaging. However, long image acquisition times, the need for qualitative expert analysis, and the lack of (and difficulty extracting) quantitative indicators that are sensitive to tissue health have curtailed widespread clinical and research studies. While recent machine learning methods for MRI reconstruction and analysis have shown promise for reducing this burden, these techniques are primarily validated with imperfect image quality metrics, which are discordant with clinically-relevant measures that ultimately hamper clinical deployment and clinician trust. To mitigate this challenge, we present the Stanford Knee MRI with Multi-Task Evaluation (SKM-TEA) dataset, a collection of quantitative knee MRI (qMRI) scans that enables end-to-end, clinically-relevant evaluation of MRI reconstruction and analysis tools. This 1.6TB dataset consists of raw-data measurements of ~25,000 slices (155 patients) of anonymized patient MRI scans, the corresponding scanner-generated DICOM images, manual segmentations of four tissues, and bounding box annotations for sixteen clinically relevant pathologies. We provide a framework for using qMRI parameter maps, along with image reconstructions and dense image labels, for measuring the quality of qMRI biomarker estimates extracted from MRI reconstruction, segmentation, and detection techniques. Finally, we use this framework to benchmark state-of-the-art baselines on this dataset. We hope our SKM-TEA dataset and code can enable a broad spectrum of research for modular image reconstruction and image analysis in a clinically informed manner.

"AI-based automated Meibomian gland segmentation, classification and   reflection correction in infrared Meibography","Ripon Kumar Saha, A. M. Mahmud Chowdhury, Kyung-Sun Na, Gyu Deok Hwang, Youngsub Eom, Jaeyoung Kim, Hae-Gon Jeon, Ho Sik Hwang, Euiheon Chung","Purpose: Develop a deep learning-based automated method to segment meibomian glands (MG) and eyelids, quantitatively analyze the MG area and MG ratio, estimate the meiboscore, and remove specular reflections from infrared images. Methods: A total of 1600 meibography images were captured in a clinical setting. 1000 images were precisely annotated with multiple revisions by investigators and graded 6 times by meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) experts. Two deep learning (DL) models were trained separately to segment areas of the MG and eyelid. Those segmentation were used to estimate MG ratio and meiboscores using a classification-based DL model. A generative adversarial network was implemented to remove specular reflections from original images. Results: The mean ratio of MG calculated by investigator annotation and DL segmentation was consistent 26.23% vs 25.12% in the upper eyelids and 32.34% vs. 32.29% in the lower eyelids, respectively. Our DL model achieved 73.01% accuracy for meiboscore classification on validation set and 59.17% accuracy when tested on images from independent center, compared to 53.44% validation accuracy by MGD experts. The DL-based approach successfully removes reflection from the original MG images without affecting meiboscore grading. Conclusions: DL with infrared meibography provides a fully automated, fast quantitative evaluation of MG morphology (MG Segmentation, MG area, MG ratio, and meiboscore) which are sufficiently accurate for diagnosing dry eye disease. Also, the DL removes specular reflection from images to be used by ophthalmologists for distraction-free assessment.",2022-05-31T05:13:56Z,2022-05-31T05:13:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15543v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15543v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.CV, eess.IV"
Crossing the Linguistic Causeway: A Binational Approach for Translating   Soundscape Attributes to Bahasa Melayu,"Bhan Lam, Julia Chieng, Karn N. Watcharasupat, Kenneth Ooi, Zhen-Ting Ong, Joo Young Hong, Woon-Seng Gan","Translation of perceptual descriptors such as the perceived affective quality attributes in the soundscape standard (ISO/TS 12913-2:2018) is an inherently intricate task, especially if the target language is used in multiple countries. Despite geographical proximity and a shared language of Bahasa Melayu (Standard Malay), differences in culture and language education policies between Singapore and Malaysia could invoke peculiarities in the affective appraisal of sounds. To generate provisional translations of the eight perceived affective attributes -- eventful, vibrant, pleasant, calm, uneventful, monotonous, annoying, and chaotic -- into Bahasa Melayu that is applicable in both Singapore and Malaysia, a binational expert-led approach supplemented by a quantitative evaluation framework was adopted. A set of preliminary translation candidates were developed via a four-stage process, firstly by a qualified translator, which was then vetted by linguistics experts, followed by examination via an experiential evaluation, and finally reviewed by the core research team. A total of 66 participants were then recruited cross-nationally to quantitatively evaluate the preliminary translation candidates. Of the eight attributes, cross-national differences were observed only in the translation of annoying. For instance, ""menjengkelkan"" was found to be significantly less understood in Singapore than in Malaysia, as well as less understandable than ""membingitkan"" within Singapore. Results of the quantitative evaluation also revealed the imperfect nature of foreign language translations for perceptual descriptors, which suggests a possibility for exploring corrective measures.",2022-06-07T08:35:06Z,2023-07-05T08:19:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03104v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.03104v2,"stat.AP, cs.SD"
Vertical versus horizontal inequalities on simply connected nilpotent   Lie groups and groups of polynomial growth,Seung-Yeon Ryoo,"We establish ``vertical versus horizontal inequalities'' for functions from nonabelian simply connected nilpotent Lie groups and not virtually abelian finitely generated groups of polynomial growth into uniformly convex Banach spaces using the vector-valued Littlewood--Paley--Stein theory approach of Lafforgue and Naor (2012). This is a quantitative nonembeddability statement that shows that any Lipschitz mapping from the aforementioned groups into a uniformly convex space must quantitatively collapse along certain subgroups. As a consequence, a ball of radius $r\ge 2$ in the aforementioned groups must incur bilipschitz distortion at least a constant multiple of $(\log r)^{1/q}$ into a $q(\ge 2)$-uniformly convex Banach space. This bound is sharp for the $L^p$ ($1<p<\infty$) spaces.   In the special case of mappings of Carnot groups into the $L^p$ ($1<p<\infty$) spaces, we prove that the quantitative collapse occurs on a larger subgroup that is the commutator subgroup; this is in line with the qualitative Pansu--Semmes nonembeddability argument given by Cheeger and Kleiner (2006) and Lee and Naor (2006). We prove this by establishing a version of the classical Dorronsoro theorem on Carnot groups. Previously, in the setting of Heisenberg groups, F\""assler and Orponen (2019) established a one-sided Dorronsoro theorem with a restriction $0<\alpha<2$ on the range of exponents $\alpha$ of the Laplacian; this restriction does not appear in the commutative setting and is caused by their use of horizontal polynomials as approximants. We identify the correct class of approximant polynomials and prove the two-sided Dorronsoro theorem with the full range $0<\alpha<\infty$ of exponents in the general setting of Carnot groups, thus strengthening and extending the work of F\""assler and Orponen.",2022-07-22T19:25:36Z,2022-07-22T19:25:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11305v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11305v1,"math.MG, math.CA, math.FA, math.GR, 30L15 (Primary) 26B05, 46B85 (Secondary)"
Robust Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping via Approximate Message   Passing with Parameter Estimation,"Shuai Huang, James J. Lah, Jason W. Allen, Deqiang Qiu","Purpose: For quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), the lack of ground-truth in clinical settings makes it challenging to determine suitable parameters for the dipole inversion. We propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach for QSM with built-in parameter estimation, and incorporate the nonlinear formulation of the dipole inversion to achieve a robust recovery of the susceptibility maps.   Theory: From a Bayesian perspective, the image wavelet coefficients are approximately sparse and modelled by the Laplace distribution. The measurement noise is modelled by a Gaussian-mixture distribution with two components, where the second component is used to model the noise outliers. Through probabilistic inference, the susceptibility map and distribution parameters can be jointly recovered using approximate message passing (AMP).   Methods: We compare our proposed AMP with built-in parameter estimation (AMP-PE) to the state-of-the-art L1-QSM, FANSI and MEDI approaches on the simulated and in vivo datasets, and perform experiments to explore the optimal settings of AMP-PE. Reproducible code is available at https://github.com/EmoryCN2L/QSM_AMP_PE   Results: On the simulated Sim2Snr1 dataset, AMP-PE achieved the lowest NRMSE, DFCM and the highest SSIM, while MEDI achieved the lowest HFEN. On the in vivo datasets, AMP-PE is robust and successfully recovers the susceptibility maps using the estimated parameters, whereas L1-QSM, FANSI and MEDI typically require additional visual fine-tuning to select or double-check working parameters.   Conclusion: AMP-PE provides automatic and adaptive parameter estimation for QSM and avoids the subjectivity from the visual fine-tuning step, making it an excellent choice for the clinical setting.",2022-07-29T14:38:03Z,2023-05-30T21:37:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14709v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14709v3,"eess.IV, cs.CV"
Investigating the robustness of a learning-based method for quantitative   phase retrieval from propagation-based x-ray phase contrast measurements   under laboratory conditions,"Rucha Deshpande, Ashish Avachat, Frank J. Brooks, Mark A. Anastasio","Quantitative phase retrieval (QPR) in propagation-based x-ray phase contrast imaging of heterogeneous and structurally complicated objects is challenging under laboratory conditions due to partial spatial coherence and polychromaticity. A learning-based method (LBM) provides a non-linear approach to this problem while not being constrained by restrictive assumptions about object properties and beam coherence. In this work, a LBM was assessed for its applicability under practical scenarios by evaluating its robustness and generalizability under typical experimental variations. Towards this end, an end-to-end LBM was employed for QPR under laboratory conditions and its robustness was investigated across various system and object conditions. The robustness of the method was tested via varying propagation distances and its generalizability with respect to object structure and experimental data was also tested. Although the LBM was stable under the studied variations, its successful deployment was found to be affected by choices pertaining to data pre-processing, network training considerations and system modeling. To our knowledge, we demonstrated for the first time, the potential applicability of an end-to-end learning-based quantitative phase retrieval method, trained on simulated data, to experimental propagation-based x-ray phase contrast measurements acquired under laboratory conditions. We considered conditions of polychromaticity, partial spatial coherence, and high noise levels, typical to laboratory conditions. This work further explored the robustness of this method to practical variations in propagation distances and object structure with the goal of assessing its potential for experimental use. Such an exploration of any LBM (irrespective of its network architecture) before practical deployment provides an understanding of its potential behavior under experimental settings.",2022-11-02T15:10:14Z,2022-11-02T15:10:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01372v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01372v1,"physics.med-ph, cs.LG, eess.IV"
The infinitesimal model with dominance,"N. H. Barton, A. M. Etheridge, A. Véber","The classical infinitesimal model is a simple and robust model for the inheritance of quantitative traits. In this model, a quantitative trait is expressed as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic (environmental) component and the genetic component of offspring traits within a family follows a normal distribution around the average of the parents' trait values, and has a variance that is independent of the trait values of the parents. In previous work, Barton et al.(2017), we showed that when trait values are determined by the sum of a large number of Mendelian factors, each of small effect, one can justify the infinitesimal model as limit of Mendelian inheritance.   In this paper, we show that the robustness of the infinitesimal model extends to include dominance. We define the model in terms of classical quantities of quantitative genetics, before justifying it as a limit of Mendelian inheritance as the number, M, of underlying loci tends to infinity. As in the additive case, the multivariate normal distribution of trait values across the pedigree can be expressed in terms of variance components in an ancestral population and probabilities of identity by descent determined by the pedigree. In this setting, it is natural to decompose trait values, not just into the additive and dominance components, but into a component that is shared by all individuals within the family and an independent `residual' for each offspring, which captures the randomness of Mendelian inheritance. We show that, even if we condition on parental trait values, both the shared component and the residuals within each family will be asymptotically normally distributed as the number of loci tends to infinity, with an error of order 1/\sqrt{M}.   We illustrate our results with some numerical examples.",2022-10-31T22:00:44Z,2023-06-28T12:35:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03515v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03515v3,"q-bio.PE, math.PR"
GraphIX: Graph-based In silico XAI(explainable artificial intelligence)   for drug repositioning from biopharmaceutical network,"Atsuko Takagi, Mayumi Kamada, Eri Hamatani, Ryosuke Kojima, Yasushi Okuno","Drug repositioning holds great promise because it can reduce the time and cost of new drug development. While drug repositioning can omit various R&D processes, confirming pharmacological effects on biomolecules is essential for application to new diseases. Biomedical explainability in a drug repositioning model can support appropriate insights in subsequent in-depth studies. However, the validity of the XAI methodology is still under debate, and the effectiveness of XAI in drug repositioning prediction applications remains unclear. In this study, we propose GraphIX, an explainable drug repositioning framework using biological networks, and quantitatively evaluate its explainability. GraphIX first learns the network weights and node features using a graph neural network from known drug indication and knowledge graph that consists of three types of nodes (but not given node type information): disease, drug, and protein. Analysis of the post-learning features showed that node types that were not known to the model beforehand are distinguished through the learning process based on the graph structure. From the learned weights and features, GraphIX then predicts the disease-drug association and calculates the contribution values of the nodes located in the neighborhood of the predicted disease and drug. We hypothesized that the neighboring protein node to which the model gave a high contribution is important in understanding the actual pharmacological effects. Quantitative evaluation of the validity of protein nodes' contribution using a real-world database showed that the high contribution proteins shown by GraphIX are reasonable as a mechanism of drug action. GraphIX is a framework for evidence-based drug discovery that can present to users new disease-drug associations and identify the protein important for understanding its pharmacological effects from a large and complex knowledge base.",2022-12-21T06:17:45Z,2022-12-27T09:23:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10788v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10788v2,"cs.LG, q-bio.QM"
New methods for new data? An overview and illustration of quantitative   inductive methods for HRM research,Alain LACROUX,"""Data is the new oil"", in short, data would be the essential source of the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which has led some commentators to assimilate too quickly the quantity of data to a source of wealth in itself, and consider the development of big data as an quasi direct cause of profit. Human resources management is not escaping this trend, and the accumulation of large amounts of data on employees is perceived by some entrepreneurs as a necessary and sufficient condition for the construction of predictive models of complex work behaviors such as absenteeism or job performance. In fact, the analogy is somewhat misleading: unlike oil, there are no major issues here concerning the production of data (whose flows are generated continuously and at low cost by various information systems), but rather their ''refining'', i.e. the operations necessary to transform this data into a useful product, namely into knowledge. This transformation is where the methodological challenges of data valuation lie, both for practitioners and for academic researchers. Considerations on the methods applicable to take advantage of the possibilities offered by these massive data are relatively recent, and often highlight the disruptive aspect of the current ''data deluge'' to point out that this evolution would be the source of a revival of empiricism in a ''fourth paradigm'' based on the intensive and ''agnostic'' exploitation of massive amounts of data in order to bring out new knowledge, following a purely inductive logic. Although we do not adopt this speculative point of view, it is clear that data-driven approaches are scarce in quantitative HRM studies. However, there are well-established methods, particularly in the field of data mining, which are based on inductive approaches. This area of quantitative analysis with an inductive aim is still relatively unexplored in HRM ( apart from typological analyses). The objective of this paper is first to give an overview of data driven methods that can be used for HRM research, before proposing an empirical illustration which consists in an exploratory research combining a latent profile analysis and an exploration by Gaussian graphical models.",2023-05-15T09:51:30Z,2023-05-15T09:51:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08889v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08889v1,"cs.LG, stat.ME"
A quantitative phase-field model for void evolution in defect   supersaturated environments: a novel introduction of defect reaction   asymmetry,"Sreekar Rayaprolu, Kyle Starkey, Anter El-Azab","Voids develop in crystalline materials under energetic particle irradiation, as in nuclear reactors. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of void nucleation and growth is of utmost importance as it leads to dimensional instability of the metallic materials. In the past two decades, researchers have adopted the phase-field approach to study the phenomena of void evolution under irradiation. The approach involves modeling the boundary between the void and matrix with a diffused interface. However, none of the existing models are quantitative in nature. This work introduces a thermodynamically consistent, quantitative diffuse interface model based on KKS formalism to describe the void evolution under irradiation. The model concurrently considers both vacancies and self-interstitials in the description of void evolution. Unique to our model is the presence of two mobility parameters in the equation of motion of the phase-field variable. The two mobility parameters relate the driving force for vacancy and self-interstitial interaction to the interface motion, analogous to dislocation motion through climb and glide processes. The asymptotic matching of the phase-field model with the sharp-interface theory fixes the two mobility parameters in terms of the material parameters in the sharp-interface model. The Landau coefficient, which controls the height of the double-well function in the phase field variable, and the gradient coefficient of the phase field variable are fixed based on the interfacial energy and interface width of the boundary. With all the parameters in the model determined in terms of the material parameters, we thus have a new phase field model for void evolution. Simple test cases will show the void evolution under various defect supersaturation to validate our new phase-field model.",2023-07-28T15:36:10Z,2024-05-21T23:01:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15626v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15626v2,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.comp-ph"

Yet, alongside these potential opportunities comes a critical challenge: attaining mature hiPSC-CM tissues. At present, there are multiple techniques to promote maturity of hiPSC-CMs including physical platforms and cell culture protocols. However, when it comes to making quantitative comparisons of functional behavior, there are limited options for reliably and reproducibly computing functional metrics that are suitable for direct cross-system comparison. In addition, the current standard functional metrics obtained from time-lapse images of cardiac microbundle contraction reported in the field (i.e., post forces, average tissue stress) do not take full advantage of the available information present in these data (i.e., full-field tissue displacements and strains).

We aimed to evaluate the MIXTURE (Multi-Interleaved X-prepared Turbo-Spin Echo with IntUitive RElaxometry) sequences that provide morphologic images with clinical turbo spin-echo (TSE) contrasts and additional parameter maps versus reference TSE sequences in an in-situ model of human cartilage defects.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospectively, standardized cartilage defects of 8mm, 5mm, and 3mm diameter were created in the lateral femora of 10 human cadaveric knee specimens (81$\pm$10 years, nine male/one female). Using a clinical 3T MRI scanner and knee coil, MIXTURE sequences combining (i) proton-density weighted fat-saturated (PD-w FS) images and T2 maps and (ii) T1-weighted images and T1$\rho$ maps were acquired before and after defect creation, alongside the corresponding 2D TSE and 3D TSE reference sequences. Defect delineability, bone texture, and cartilage relaxation times were quantified. Inter-sequence comparisons were made using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests.   RESULTS: Overall, defect delineability and texture features were not significantly different between the MIXTURE and reference sequences. After defect creation, relaxation times increased significantly in the central femur (for T2) and all regions combined (for T1$\rho$).

Abstract Syntax Tree for Programming Language Understanding and   Representation: How Far Are We?,"Weisong Sun, Chunrong Fang, Yun Miao, Yudu You, Mengzhe Yuan, Yuchen Chen, Quanjun Zhang, An Guo, Xiang Chen, Yang Liu, Zhenyu Chen","Programming language understanding and representation (a.k.a code representation learning) has always been a hot and challenging task in software engineering. It aims to apply deep learning techniques to produce numerical representations of the source code features while preserving its semantics. These representations can be used for facilitating subsequent code-related tasks. The abstract syntax tree (AST), a fundamental code feature, illustrates the syntactic information of the source code and has been widely used in code representation learning. However, there is still a lack of systematic and quantitative evaluation of how well AST-based code representation facilitates subsequent code-related tasks. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of the AST-based code representation in facilitating follow-up code-related tasks. To do so, we compare the performance of models trained with code token sequence (Token for short) based code representation and AST-based code representation on three popular types of code-related tasks. Surprisingly, the overall quantitative statistical results demonstrate that models trained with AST-based code representation consistently perform worse across all three tasks compared to models trained with Token-based code representation. Our further quantitative analysis reveals that models trained with AST-based code representation outperform models trained with Token-based code representation in certain subsets of samples across all three tasks.

A key ingredient for these models is the input photospheric magnetic field map that provides the boundary condition for the coronal portion of many heliospheric models. In this paper, we perform steady-state, data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar wind during Carrington rotation 2258 with the GAMERA model. We use the ADAPT and AFT flux transport models and quantitatively assess how well each model matches in-situ measurements from Parker, SolO, and Earth. We find that both models reproduce the magnetic field components at Parker quantitatively well. At SolO and Earth, the magnetic field is reproduced relatively well, though not as well as at Parker, and the density is reproduced extremely poorly. The velocity is overpredicted at Parker, but not at SolO or Earth, hinting that the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) relation, fine-tuned for Earth, misses the deceleration of the solar wind near the Sun. We conclude that AFT performs quantitatively similarly to ADAPT in all cases and that both models are comparable to a purely WSA heliospheric treatment with no MHD component.

AMPCliff: quantitative definition and benchmarking of activity cliffs in   antimicrobial peptides,"Kewei Li, Yuqian Wu, Yinheng Li, Yutong Guo, Yan Wang, Yiyang Liang, Yusi Fan, Lan Huang, Ruochi Zhang, Fengfeng Zhou","Since the mechanism of action of drug molecules in the human body is difficult to reproduce in the in vitro environment, it becomes difficult to reveal the causes of the activity cliff phenomenon of drug molecules. We found out the AC of small molecules has been extensively investigated but limited knowledge is accumulated about the AC phenomenon in peptides with canonical amino acids. Understanding the mechanism of AC in canonical amino acids might help understand the one in drug molecules. This study introduces a quantitative definition and benchmarking framework AMPCliff for the AC phenomenon in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) composed by canonical amino acids. A comprehensive analysis of the existing AMP dataset reveals a significant prevalence of AC within AMPs.

This study establishes a benchmark dataset of paired AMPs in Staphylococcus aureus from the publicly available AMP dataset GRAMPA, and conducts a rigorous procedure to evaluate various AMP AC prediction models, including nine machine learning, four deep learning algorithms, four masked language models, and four generative language models. Our analysis reveals that these models are capable of detecting AMP AC events and the pre-trained protein language model ESM2 demonstrates superior performance across the evaluations. The predictive performance of AMP activity cliffs remains to be further improved, considering that ESM2 with 33 layers only achieves the Spearman correlation coefficient 0.4669 for the regression task of the MIC values on the benchmark dataset.

Chen, Emma Lejeune","Movies of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived engineered cardiac tissue (microbundles) contain abundant information about structural and functional maturity. However, extracting these data in a reproducible and high-throughput manner remains a major challenge. Furthermore, it is not straightforward to make direct quantitative comparisons across the multiple in vitro experimental platforms employed to fabricate these tissues. Here, we present ""MicroBundlePillarTrack,"" an open-source optical flow-based package developed in Python to track the deflection of pillars in cardiac microbundles grown on experimental platforms with two different pillar designs (""Type 1"" and ""Type 2"" design). Our software is able to automatically segment the pillars, track their displacements, and output time-dependent metrics for contractility analysis, including beating amplitude and rate, contractile force, and tissue stress. Because this software is fully automated, it will allow for both faster and more reproducible analyses of larger datasets and it will enable more reliable cross-platform comparisons as compared to existing approaches that require manual steps and are tailored to a specific experimental platform. To complement this open-source software, we share a dataset of 1,540 brightfield example movies on which we have tested our software. Through sharing this data and software, our goal is to directly enable quantitative comparisons across labs, and facilitate future collective progress via the biomedical engineering open-source data and software ecosystem.",2024-05-17T21:20:18Z,2024-08-15T17:49:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11096v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11096v2,"q-bio.QM, 92F05, 74A05, J.2; J.3"
In-vivo high-resolution χ-separation at 7T,"Jiye Kim, Minjun Kim, Sooyeon Ji, Kyeongseon Min, Hwihun Jeong, Hyeong-Geol Shin, Chungseok Oh, Sina Straub, Seong-Gi Kim, Jongho Lee","A recently introduced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique, $\chi$-separation, offers the capability to separate paramagnetic ($\chi_{\text{para}}$) and diamagnetic ($\chi_{\text{dia}}$) susceptibility distribution within the brain. In-vivo high-resolution mapping of iron and myelin distribution, estimated by $\chi$-separation, could provide a deeper understanding of brain substructures, assisting the investigation of their functions and alterations. This can be achieved using 7T MRI, which benefits from a high signal-to-noise ratio and susceptibility effects. However, applying $\chi$-separation at 7T presents difficulties due to the requirement of an $R_2$ map, coupled with issues such as high specific absorption rate (SAR), large $B_1$ transmit field inhomogeneities, and prolonged scan time.   To address these challenges, we developed a novel deep neural network, R2PRIMEnet7T, designed to convert a 7T $R_2^*$ map into a 3T $R_2'$ map. Building on this development, we present a new pipeline for $\chi$-separation at 7T, enabling us to generate high-resolution $\chi$-separation maps from multi-echo gradient-echo data. The proposed method is compared with alternative pipelines, such as an end-to-end network and linearly-scaled $R_2'$, and is validated against $\chi$-separation maps at 3T, demonstrating its accuracy. The 7T $\chi$-separation maps generated by the proposed method exhibit similar contrasts to those from 3T, while 7T high-resolution maps offer enhanced clarity and detail. Quantitative analysis confirms that the proposed method surpasses the alternative pipelines. The proposed method results well delineate the detailed brain structures associated with iron and myelin. This new pipeline holds promise for analyzing iron and myelin concentration changes in various neurodegenerative diseases through precise structural examination.",2024-10-16T05:00:48Z,2024-10-17T03:58:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12239v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12239v2,"q-bio.QM, physics.med-ph"
A Joint Representation Using Continuous and Discrete Features for   Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction on Chest CT Scans,"Minfeng Xu, Chen-Chen Fan, Yan-Jie Zhou, Wenchao Guo, Pan Liu, Jing Qi, Le Lu, Hanqing Chao, Kunlun He","Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a leading health concern and contribute significantly to global mortality rates. While clinical advancements have led to a decline in CVD mortality, accurately identifying individuals who could benefit from preventive interventions remains an unsolved challenge in preventive cardiology. Current CVD risk prediction models, recommended by guidelines, are based on limited traditional risk factors or use CT imaging to acquire quantitative biomarkers, and still have limitations in predictive accuracy and applicability. On the other hand, end-to-end trained CVD risk prediction methods leveraging deep learning on CT images often fail to provide transparent and explainable decision grounds for assisting physicians. In this work, we proposed a novel joint representation that integrates discrete quantitative biomarkers and continuous deep features extracted from chest CT scans. Our approach initiated with a deep CVD risk classification model by capturing comprehensive continuous deep learning features while jointly obtaining currently clinical-established quantitative biomarkers via segmentation models. In the feature joint representation stage, we use an instance-wise feature-gated mechanism to align the continuous and discrete features, followed by a soft instance-wise feature interaction mechanism fostering independent and effective feature interaction for the final CVD risk prediction. Our method substantially improves CVD risk predictive performance and offers individual contribution analysis of each biomarker, which is important in assisting physicians' decision-making processes. We validated our method on a public chest low-dose CT dataset and a private external chest standard-dose CT patient cohort of 17,207 CT volumes from 6,393 unique subjects, and demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving AUCs of 0.875 and 0.843, respectively.",2024-10-24T10:06:45Z,2024-11-15T09:02:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18610v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18610v2,"eess.IV, cs.CV"

Marques","Background: Brain maturation and aging involve significant microstructural changes, resulting in functional and cognitive alterations. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) can measure this evolution, distinguishing the physiological effects of normal aging from pathological deviations.   Methods: We conducted a multicentre study using qMRI metrics (R1, R2*, and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping) to model age trajectories across brain structures, including tractography-based white matter bundles (TWMB), superficial white matter (SWM), and cortical grey matter (CGM). MRI data from 537 healthy subjects, aged 8 to 79 years, were harmonized using two independent methods. We modeled age trajectories and performed regional analyses to capture maturation patterns and aging effects across the lifespan.   Findings: Our findings revealed a distinct brain maturation gradient, with early qMRI peak values in TWMB, followed by SWM, and culminating in CGM regions. This gradient was observed as a posterior-to-anterior maturation pattern in the cortex and an inferior-to-superior maturation pattern in white matter tracts. R1 demonstrated the most robust age trajectories, while R2* and susceptibility exhibited greater variability and different patterns. The normative modeling framework confirmed the reliability of our age-modelled trajectories across datasets.   Interpretation: Our study highlights the potential of multiparametric qMRI to capture complex, region-specific brain development patterns, addressing the need for comprehensive, age-spanning studies across multiple brain structures. Various harmonization strategies can merge qMRI cohorts, improving the robustness of qMRI-based age models and facilitating the understanding of normal patterns and disease-associated deviations.",2024-11-01T15:26:36Z,2024-11-01T15:26:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00661v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00661v1,"physics.med-ph, q-bio.NC"

Ionita","Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), typically due to intracranial aneurysms, demands precise imaging for effective treatment. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), despite being the gold standard, broadly visualizes cerebral blood flow, potentially masking key details in areas. This study introduces an approach integrating a 3D vascular atlas with 2D DSA images to allow targeted quantitative analysis in these crucial regions, thus enhancing diagnostic accuracy during interventions. Initially, DSA data was examined to ascertain the injection site. Following this, the appropriate viewing angle was determined to align accurately with the 3D vascular atlas. Utilizing this atlas, regions corresponding to the areas indicated as perfused were selected. Concurrently, a mask representing the perfused areas was created from the DSA sequence. This mask facilitated the initial coarse alignment of the projected 3D atlas to the DSA perfused territory deformable registration techniques, ensuring a precise overlay with the DSAs perfused territories. The performance of each overlay was measured using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). The coregistration process revealed that deformable registrations was essential to achieve precise overlays of the 3D atlas projections with the 2D DSA perfused areas. This approach enabled the extraction of targeted quantitative angiography parameters, essential for detailed vascular assessment in subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. The integration of 3D atlas registration with 2D DSA projections facilitates a more precise and targeted diagnostic process for SAH during critical interventions.

Wilding, Junghun Cho, Dejan Jakimovski, Niels Bergsland, Michael G. Dwyer, Robert Zivadinov, Ferdinand Schweser","Background: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain is an advanced MRI technique for assessing tissue characteristics based on magnetic susceptibility, which varies with the composition of the tissue, such as iron, calcium, and myelin levels. QSM consists of multiple processing steps, with various choices for each step. Despite its increasing application in detecting and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, the impact of algorithmic choices in QSM's workflow on clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly quantified.   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how choices in background field removal (BFR), dipole inversion algorithms, and anatomical referencing impact the sensitivity and reproducibility error of QSM in detecting group-level and longitudinal changes in deep gray matter susceptibility in a clinical setting.   Methods: We compared 378 different QSM pipelines using a 10-year follow-up dataset of healthy adults. We analyzed the sensitivity of pipelines to detect known aging-related susceptibility changes in the DGM over time.   Results: We found high variability in the sensitivity of QSM pipelines to detect susceptibility changes. The study highlighted that while most pipelines could detect changes reliably, the choice of BFR algorithm and the referencing strategy substantially influenced the outcome reproducibility error and sensitivity. Notably, pipelines using RESHARP with AMP-PE, HEIDI or LSQR inversion showed the highest overall sensitivity.   Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical influence of algorithmic choices in QSM processing on the accuracy and reliability of detecting physiological changes in the brain. This has profound implications for clinical research and trials where QSM is used as a biomarker for disease progression, highlighting that careful consideration should be given to pipeline configuration to optimize clinical outcomes.",2025-01-28T18:58:43Z,2025-01-28T18:58:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17158v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17158v1,"q-bio.QM, eess.IV, physics.comp-ph, physics.med-ph"
Can We Trust AI Benchmarks? An Interdisciplinary Review of Current   Issues in AI Evaluation,"Maria Eriksson, Erasmo Purificato, Arman Noroozian, Joao Vinagre, Guillaume Chaslot, Emilia Gomez, David Fernandez-Llorca","Quantitative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Benchmarks have emerged as fundamental tools for evaluating the performance, capability, and safety of AI models and systems. Currently, they shape the direction of AI development and are playing an increasingly prominent role in regulatory frameworks. As their influence grows, however, so too does concerns about how and with what effects they evaluate highly sensitive topics such as capabilities, including high-impact capabilities, safety and systemic risks. This paper presents an interdisciplinary meta-review of about 100 studies that discuss shortcomings in quantitative benchmarking practices, published in the last 10 years. It brings together many fine-grained issues in the design and application of benchmarks (such as biases in dataset creation, inadequate documentation, data contamination, and failures to distinguish signal from noise) with broader sociotechnical issues (such as an over-focus on evaluating text-based AI models according to one-time testing logic that fails to account for how AI models are increasingly multimodal and interact with humans and other technical systems). Our review also highlights a series of systemic flaws in current benchmarking practices, such as misaligned incentives, construct validity issues, unknown unknowns, and problems with the gaming of benchmark results. Furthermore, it underscores how benchmark practices are fundamentally shaped by cultural, commercial and competitive dynamics that often prioritise state-of-the-art performance at the expense of broader societal concerns. By providing an overview of risks associated with existing benchmarking procedures, we problematise disproportionate trust placed in benchmarks and contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the accountability and relevance of quantitative AI benchmarks within the complexities of real-world scenarios.",2025-02-10T15:25:06Z,2025-02-10T15:25:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06559v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06559v1,"cs.AI, I.2.0; A.1"

The onset of detection is a continuous phase transition which can be viewed as a localization-delocalization transition. The ``fidelity'' of the alignment is the order parameter of that transition; it leads to criteria for the selection of optimal alignment parameters.,1995-11-15T03:17:27Z,1995-11-15T03:17:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9511072v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9511072v1,"cond-mat, comp-gas, nlin.CG, q-bio.QM"
Multifractal Analysis of the Coupling Space of Feed-Forward Neural   Networks,"A. Engel, M. Weigt",Random input patterns induce a partition of the coupling space of feed-forward neural networks into different cells according to the generated output sequence. For the perceptron this partition forms a random multifractal for which the spectrum $f(\alpha)$ can be calculated analytically using the replica trick. Phase transition in the multifractal spectrum correspond to the crossover from percolating to non-percolating cell sizes.

To elucidate the interplay of viscous drag, twisting, and bending in the overdamped dynamics of such filaments, we compute the steady-state torsional stress and shape of a rotating rod with a kink.

Instead, stalk formation destabilizes the membranes and results in hole formation in the vicinity of the stalks. When holes in each bilayer nucleate spontaneously next to the same stalk, an incomplete fusion pore is formed. The fusion process is completed by propagation of the initial connection, the stalk, along the edges of the aligned holes.",2001-10-10T17:39:16Z,2001-10-10T17:39:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0110207v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0110207v1,"cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph, q-bio"

Transitions in Oscillatory Dynamics of Two Connected Neurons with   Excitatory Synapses,"Yasser Roudi, Shahin Rouhani","It is shown that long term behavior of two connected Integrate- and- Fire neurons with excitatory synapses is determined by some fixed-points. In the case of equal synaptic weights four different dynamic phases are found. Between these phases there is a specific phase with a global attractor fixed-point, which is of interest from different viewpoints. Simulations support our analytic work. When synaptic weights are equal we observe no synchronization but with different weight we do observe an almost synchronous state. Simulations show that when there is only one non-trivial fixed-point the period of oscillations is stable against small changes in synaptic weights",2002-03-04T18:33:48Z,2002-03-05T14:37:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0203037v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0203037v2,"cond-mat.dis-nn, q-bio"
Neural Network Model for Apparent Deterministic Chaos in Spontaneously   Bursting Hippocampal Slices,"B. Biswal, C.

Complementarity and diversity in a soluble model ecosystem,"Viviane M. de Oliveira, J. F.

Analysis reveals a possible physical origin for the converging behavior of solvation entropies for a series of homologous hydrophobic compounds.

Rapid Determination of Multiple Reaction Pathways in Molecular Systems:   The Soft-Ratcheting Algorithm,"Daniel M. Zuckerman, Thomas B. Woolf","We discuss the ``soft-ratcheting'' algorithm which generates targeted stochastic trajectories in molecular systems with scores corresponding to their probabilities. The procedure, which requires no initial pathway guess, is capable of rapidly determining multiple pathways between known states. Monotonic progress toward the target state is not required. The soft-ratcheting algorithm is applied to an all-atom model of alanine dipeptide, whose unbiased trajectories are assumed to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics. All possible pathways on the two-dimensional dihedral surface are determined.

The common answer to this problem is the imitation of the codon usage of the target species. Here we discuss several other features of coding sequences (``coding statistics'') that are relevant for the ``genomic style'' of different species. A genetic algorithm is then used to obtain backtranslations that mimic these styles, by minimizing the difference in the coding statistics.

Statistical Properties of Demand Fluctuation in the Financial Market,"Kaushik Matia, Kazuko Yamasaki","We examine the out-of-equilibrium phase reported by Plerou {\it et. al.} in Nature, {\bf 421}, 130 (2003) using the data of the New York stock market (NYSE) between the years 2001 --2002.

The Economic Mobility in Money Transfer,"Ning Ding, Ning Xi, Yougui Wang","In this paper, we investigate the economic mobility in some money transfer models which have been applied into the research on wealth distribution. We demonstrate the mobility by recording the time series of agents' ranks and observing their volatility. We also compare the mobility quantitatively by employing an index, ""the per capita aggregate change in log-income"", raised by economists. Like the shape of distribution, the character of mobility is also decided by the trading rule in these transfer models. It is worth noting that even though different models have the same type of distribution, their mobility characters may be quite different.",2005-07-21T09:02:54Z,2005-07-28T14:05:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0507158v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0507158v2,"physics.soc-ph, q-fin.GN"

Symbolic dynamics of biological feedback networks,"Simone Pigolotti, Sandeep Krishna, Mogens H.

Evolution and the second law of thermodynamics,Emory F.

It is found that the tensor force induced isospin-dependence of SRC softens significantly the nuclear symmetry energy especially at supra-saturation densities.,2011-04-11T22:05:40Z,2011-04-11T22:05:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2075v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.2075v1,"nucl-th, astro-ph.SR, nucl-ex"
Temporary mirror symmetry breaking and chiral excursions in open and   closed systems,"Celia Blanco, Michael Stich, David Hochberg","The reversible Frank model is capable of amplifying the initial small statistical deviations from the idealized racemic composition. This temporary amplification can be interpreted as a chiral excursion in a dynamic phase space. It is well known that if the system is open to matter and energy exchange, a permanently chiral state can be reached asymptotically, while the final state is necessarily racemic if the system is closed. In this work, we combine phase space analysis, stability analysis and numerical simulations to study the initial chiral excursions and determine how they depend on whether the system is open, semi-open or closed.",2011-04-12T14:37:55Z,2011-04-12T14:37:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2229v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.2229v1,"physics.chem-ph, cond-mat.soft, q-bio.QM"

We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.",2012-09-06T05:03:47Z,2012-09-06T05:03:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1179v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.1179v1,"physics.bio-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, q-bio.PE"

Spectral stability estimates for the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacian in   rough domains,"Antoine Lemenant, Emmanouil Milakis, Laura V.

Whereas this lemma could be applied under different regularity assumptions on the domain, here we use it to estimate the spectrum in Lipschitz and in so-called Reifenberg-flat domains. Our argument also relies on suitable extension techniques and on an estimate on the decay of the eigenfunctions at the boundary which could be interpreted as a boundary regularity result.",2012-09-17T08:31:20Z,2012-09-17T08:31:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3581v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.3581v1,"math.AP, 49G05, 35J20, 49Q20"

Counting Markov Blanket Structures,"Shyam Visweswaran, Gregory F. Cooper","Learning Markov blanket (MB) structures has proven useful in performing feature selection, learning Bayesian networks (BNs), and discovering causal relationships. We present a formula for efficiently determining the number of MB structures given a target variable and a set of other variables. As expected, the number of MB structures grows exponentially. However, we show quantitatively that there are many fewer MB structures that contain the target variable than there are BN structures that contain it. In particular, the ratio of BN structures to MB structures appears to increase exponentially in the number of variables.",2014-07-09T14:02:01Z,2014-07-12T17:23:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2483v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2483v2,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG"

On effective equidistribution for higher step nilflows,"Livio Flaminio, Giovanni Forni","The main goal of this paper is to obtain optimal estimates on the speed of equidistribution of nilflows on higher step nilmanifolds.

Coalescence Model for Crumpled Globules Formed in Polymer Collapse,"Guy Bunin, Mehran Kardar","The rapid collapse of a polymer, due to external forces or changes in solvent, yields a long-lived `crumpled globule.'

A Type Theory for Probabilistic and Bayesian Reasoning,"Robin Adams, Bart Jacobs","This paper introduces a novel type theory and logic for probabilistic reasoning. Its logic is quantitative, with fuzzy predicates. It includes normalisation and conditioning of states. This conditioning uses a key aspect that distinguishes our probabilistic type theory from quantum type theory, namely the bijective correspondence between predicates and side-effect free actions (called instrument, or assert, maps). The paper shows how suitable computation rules can be derived from this predicate-action correspondence, and uses these rules for calculating conditional probabilities in two well-known examples of Bayesian reasoning in (graphical) models.

Uniform boundary regularity in almost-periodic homogenization,Jinping Zhuge,"In the present paper, we generalize the theory of quantitative homogenization for second-order elliptic systems with rapidly oscillating coefficients in $APW^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which is the space of almost-periodic functions in the sense of H.

A time warping approach to multiple sequence alignment,"Ana Arribas-Gil, Catherine Matias","We propose an approach for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) derived from the dynamic time warping viewpoint and recent techniques of curve synchronization developed in the context of functional data analysis. Starting from pairwise alignments of all the sequences (viewed as paths in a certain space), we construct a median path that represents the MSA we are looking for. We establish a proof of concept that our method could be an interesting ingredient to include into refined MSA techniques. We present a simple synthetic experiment as well as the study of a benchmark dataset, together with comparisons with 2 widely used MSA softwares.",2016-06-20T08:56:38Z,2017-01-06T15:39:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06017v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06017v2,"stat.AP, q-bio.QM"
Statistics of topological RNA structures,"Thomas J. X. Li, Christian M. Reidys","In this paper we study properties of topological RNA structures, i.e.~RNA contact structures with cross-serial interactions that are filtered by their topological genus. RNA secondary structures within this framework are topological structures having genus zero. We derive a new bivariate generating function whose singular expansion allows us to analyze the distributions of arcs, stacks, hairpin- , interior- and multi-loops. We then extend this analysis to H-type pseudoknots, kissing hairpins as well as $3$-knots and compute their respective expectation values. Finally we discuss our results and put them into context with data obtained by uniform sampling structures of fixed genus.",2016-06-22T14:03:02Z,2016-06-22T14:03:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06956v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06956v1,"math.CO, q-bio.BM, q-bio.QM, stat.CO, 05A16, 92E10, 92B05"
An uncertainty principle and lower bounds for the Dirichlet Laplacian on   graphs,"Daniel Lenz, Peter Stollmann, Gunter Stolz",We prove a quantitative uncertainty principle at low energies for the Laplacian on fairly general weighted graphs with a uniform explicit control of the constants in terms of geometric quantities.

When is the sum of complemented subspaces complemented?,Ivan Feshchenko,"We provide a sufficient condition for the sum of a finite number of complemented subspaces of a Banach space to be complemented. Under this condition a formula for a projection onto the sum is given. We also show that the condition is sharp (in a certain sense). As applications, we get (1) sufficient conditions for the complementability of sums of marginal subspaces in $L^p$ and sums of tensor powers of subspaces in a tensor power of a Banach space and (2) quantitative results on stability of the complementability property of the sum of linearly independent subspaces.",2016-06-26T16:07:12Z,2018-07-20T13:54:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08048v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08048v3,"math.FA, Primary 46B99, Secondary 46B28, 46N30"
Study of optical nonlinearity of a highly dispersive medium using   optical heterodyne detection technique,"Arup Bhowmick, Sushree S.

The technique has been demonstrated for Rydberg Electro-magnetically induced transparency (EIT) in rubidium thermal vapor and the optical non-linearity of a probe beam with variable intensity has been studied.

This Letter reports an experiment where, for certain quasicrystals, these properties can be directly retrieved from diffraction.

Adaptive Gray World-Based Color Normalization of Thin Blood Film Images,"F. Boray Tek, Andrew G. Dempster, İzzet Kale",This paper presents an effective color normalization method for thin blood film images of peripheral blood specimens. Thin blood film images can easily be separated to foreground (cell) and background (plasma) parts. The color of the plasma region is used to estimate and reduce the differences arising from different illumination conditions. A second stage normalization based on the database-gray world algorithm transforms the color of the foreground objects to match a reference color character. The quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and its advantages against two other general purpose color correction methods: simple gray world and Retinex.,2016-07-14T08:40:07Z,2016-07-14T08:40:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04032v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04032v1,"cs.CV, 68U10"
Layerwise computability and image randomness,"Laurent Bienvenu, Mathieu Hoyrup, Alexander Shen","Algorithmic randomness theory starts with a notion of an individual random object. To be reasonable, this notion should have some natural properties; in particular, an object should be random with respect to image distribution if and only if it has a random preimage. This result (for computable distributions and mappings, and Martin-L\""of randomness) was known for a long time (folklore); in this paper we prove its natural generalization for layerwise computable mappings, and discuss the related quantitative results.",2016-07-14T18:13:17Z,2016-07-14T18:13:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04232v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04232v1,"math.LO, cs.IT, math.IT, math.PR, 03D32, G.3"
Novel Theory for Transient Light Matter Interaction,Tomobumi Mishina,A new theory is proposed for explaining the experimental results with intense short optical pulses.

Scout-It: Interior tomography using modified scout acquisition,Kriti Sen Sharma,"Global scout views have been previously used to reduce interior reconstruction artifacts in high-resolution micro-CT and C-arm systems. However these methods cannot be directly used in the all-important domain of clinical CT. This is because when the CT scan is truncated, the scout views are also truncated. However many cases of truncation in clinical CT involve partial truncation, where the anterio-posterior (AP) scout is truncated, but the medio-lateral (ML) scout is non-truncated. In this paper, we show that in such cases of partially truncated CT scans, a modified configuration may be used to acquire non-truncated AP scout view, and ultimately allow for highly accurate interior reconstruction.",2016-08-14T04:42:30Z,2016-08-14T04:42:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04059v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04059v1,"q-bio.QM, cs.CV"

Reverse-engineering invariant manifolds with asymptotic phase,"Matthew Kvalheim, Shai Revzen","We present a recipe for rendering a submanifold normally hyperbolic and invariant within a stability basin. The construction includes the ability to choose the asymptotic phase map. We are motivated by the notion of ""templates and anchors"" -- the biomechanical observation that animal motions are often governed by low dimensional dynamics -- and the growing applications in robotics which desire means for making such biologically derived templates govern the dynamics of robots. Our approach is fairly universal, in the sense that a broad range of model reduction constructions must be normally hyperbolic if they are robust, and a broad range of such normally hyperbolic systems can be produces from our construction.",2016-08-30T13:30:35Z,2016-08-30T13:30:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08442v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08442v1,"math.DS, math.OC, q-bio.QM"
